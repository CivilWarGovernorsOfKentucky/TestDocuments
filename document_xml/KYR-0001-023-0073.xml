<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir</p>
<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stoddard of Elgin has forwarded to this place a letter in reference to M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Jaques. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stoddard did not state whether he had replied to it or not, for fear he has not I will state the case as near as I can.</p>
<p>Mr Jaques is good, worthy man, he has seen better days, was once in very good circumstances, now he has been sick very much, and has had pecuniary losses so he is reduced in circumstances<pb/>
<lb/>and his constitution is broken down, his condition was such that he could do nothing toward supporting his family, consequently his children were put out to different places, his Wife is at work in Battle Creek and he continued to maintain himself by Peddling Books.</p>
<p>If he is now unable to do that, his is truly a case deserving sympathy and charity, hoping that suspicions of his need will not be added to his other troubles, </p>
<p>I am Yours Respectfully
<lb/>Charles Austin</p>
