<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Governor M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin</p>
<p>Mr E Lawrence Presented to me a petition to sign -- which I willingly did. The petition as I understand is for you to set at Liberty Friedrich Baker, who was sentenced to the pentitentiary for one year. He was a citizen of my Neighborhood -- and my honest conviction is that he is a good citizen, and that some one living beyong the Ohio river stole the trees and that the said Baker bought them of (said unknown person), and that he did not <hi rend="str">intend</hi> steal them as was certified before the court, The Evidence given in against Said Baker. -- The Jury could not help sentencing him and committing him to the penitentiary. If your Excellency will reprieve him, It will meet with the apporuval of all his friends. and petitioners. and I think will be the means of restoring a worthy man to his family &amp;c c</p>
