   <p>County of Fleming State of Kentucky</p>
<p>J. A. Jackson being first duly sworn deposeth and says that on or about the last of <date when="1863-08">August</date> or first of <date when="1863-09">September 1863</date> in the evening returning from circuit court on the Flemingsburg and Elizaville Pike in company with Samuel Mitchell and others, when Mr John Rickets came up with us between Isaac Darnalls &amp; the Toll Gate. Mr Samuel Mitchell asked me who said Rickets was, I told him it was John Rickets. Mr Samuel -- Mitchel said that is the man that helped Ralls take my Fiddle. Said Rickets said it was a Lie &amp; called said Mitchell a Liar repeatedly. I heard said Rickets say he had a Pistol and ran his hand into his bosom as if he was going to draw it<pb/>
<lb/>Rickets then replied that he had no Pistol but stated that Mitchell had. Mitchell replied Yes I have, and he drew it out of his left coat pocket with his left hand holding it all the time in the same hand with the side of the Pistol to said Rickets and the muzzle elevated all the time and returned it to the same pocket with the same hand. I heard no threats made to shoot said Rickets at any time and was walking imediately behind, close enough to hear all that was said. I saw no attempt made nor heard no threat made to hurt mr Rickets on that or any other occasion, The pistol was in the left hand out side coat pocket with the handle out so that it could be seen by all and did not consider it a<pb/>
<lb/>concealed weapon,</p>
<p>J. A. Jackson</p>
