   <p>His Excellency Thomas E Bramlett
<lb/>Govoner of the State of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners would state that Dr T C Armstrong a citizen of Garrard County Ky did on <gap/> send to Agrippa Scott a note which not was charged to have been a challenge to fight the said Scott a duel with a deadly mission &amp;c -- that an indictment was found against said Armstrong that Armstrong although advised by his Counsil that the note did not amount to a Challenge within the meaning of the Statute suffered by agreement a Judgment against him for Five hundred ^dollars^ rather than undergo the continued vexation trouble consequent upon attending to the case -- Dr Armstrong being a practicing physician living ten miles from the County seat. the case having ^been^ put off for several Courts sometimes by the Commonwealth at the others by sickness of Deft. Your Petitioners would state that at the time the note was written &amp; sent Armstrong was in a state of intoxication, that it was sent by a negro to the Post Office &amp; thus conveyed to Scott. That the bearing of Armstrong at the time of sending the note &amp; his failure to follow up the affair should that it was from the effects of an unfortunate spree &amp; from no fixed wicked purpose or a desire to violate the Statute Your Petitioners would state that Dr Armstrong except upon<pb/>
<lb/>very rare occasions when under the influense of liquor is a remarkably quiet, modest, social gentleman &amp; in all regards a good citizen they believe that Dr Armstrong is in every way worthy of your clemency -- </p>
<p>Your Petitioners hope &amp; believe that the object of the statute will in no wise be defeated by the remission of the fine in this case wherefore they pray that the fine against Dr Armstrong may be remitted</p>
