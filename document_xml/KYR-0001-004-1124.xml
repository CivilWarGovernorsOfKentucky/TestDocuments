<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> E. Bramlette
<lb/>Govenor of Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Harrison County Ky would most respectfully state that on the <date when="1863-03-24">24<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of March 1863.</date> A. P. Baird was tried in this county before Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> Boyd and Samuel Be<hi rend="str">a</hi>aird two Justices of the Peace for said county on the charge of stabbing John Bell, That by said Justice's court said A. P. Baird was held over for further trial, in the Harrison Circuit Court, That said Baird was recognized in the sum of $250.<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> for his appearance in said court on the first day of its ensueing term. That in accordance with the requirements of said recognizance bonds. the said A. P. Baird was present and surrendered himself up to the court on the first day of the term. and was ready willing, and anxiously awaiting his trial. and there being a large<pb/>
<lb/>amount of Criminal business before the court, he was told by his Lawyer and by the Commonwealth's attorney pro tem that it would be some time probably several days before his case would come up for trial, and that it was not necessary for him to remain immediately in the court room all the time, but to be about so that he could be present in a moments warning when needed. which he did and not being informed by his Lawyer when precisely his case would be called, when it was called he was not present in the immediate court room although near by and his bond of $250 -- was forfeited, We state that A. P. Baird is here in this county now that he does not nor has he ever made any attempt to escape a trial or Justice, but on the contrary is ready and anxious for a trial, That s<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> Mr Baird is a poor man, and if he has this amount to pay to the commonwealth it will be very hard on him, <pb/>
<lb/>and inasmuch as we believe that said A. P. Baird has not acted otherwise than in obedience to the ^advice of the Attys aforesaid &amp; what he thought to be the rules of law &amp; of The^ <hi rend="str">off</hi> Court and the obligations of his bond, we ask and trust that this case may be the object of Executive Clemency.</p>
