<lb/>His Excellency B Magoffin</p>
<p>Dear Governor a petition will be presented to you to releive as fare as your have the constitutional power. T N Perry &amp; James Barber as the Surities of one F C Adams from a fine or rather three fines inflicted on him here. I am not at all in favor of the free Exercise of Executive power, to relive the guilty from the penalties attached to their offence yet cases do occur where the public good required Such Executive interposition. I am persuaided the case of Adams &amp; his Suities is Such a case, young Adams at the time of his offense, was very young, became intoxicated, and <unclear/> the Law was put in Jail &amp; his surities became bound for him at the request of his wife &amp; on his promis of future good conduct, how he has redeemed this promis I have inquired into this employer informs me hs is labouring at $20 per month dilagently keeps sober, and applies his earnings as folows $5 per month to pay debts heretofore contracted &amp; $15 to the honest support of his family, he is unable to pay the fine, if the surities are compelled to, they will coerce him to if they can, now! would not the government like a good parent have compassion on the repenting child, and as fare as She can release the penalty, these Sugestions are adressed to your Sound &amp; humane descretion, your humble Servant.</p>
