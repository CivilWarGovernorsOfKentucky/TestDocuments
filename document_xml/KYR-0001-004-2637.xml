<lb/>His Excellency Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bramlette</p>
<p>Sir you wil find enclosed a Petition Signed by a number of good Citizens of the Counties of Bath and Fleming for the purpose of getting Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> M Crump ^Released^ of Robbery as Charged. the facts of the case as I understand it. and believe is he was a regular Union Soldier and was ordered to take any or all arms from Rebels, he made a demand of the Said Arms and was told that they were Sold. he then demanded the money the Arms were Sold for, he afterwards through malice as we think was presented by the Grand Jury of Fleming Circuit Court. I Know him to have been a Union Soldier and I think done nothing more than any other Soldier done, or was ordered to doo.</p>
<p>I hope you will pardon any fine that may be assessed against him or set aside the Indictment the Court Sits again the 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> Monday in dec<hi rend="sup">br</hi> next please let us hear from you before that time direct to me or Melvin Crump Sherburne Ky</p>
