<lb/>To His Exelency.
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramlett
<lb/>Govenor of Ky.
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I have the honor to ask of you whether or not the raising and arming of an Independent Co Say from 20" to 40 Men for the Sole purpos of hunting down Guerillas in Ky. would meet your Sanction I reside in Caldwell Co. Ky. I have Served three years in the 20" Ky. Infy. &amp; have Commanded Co. for the most part of the time now that I am mustered out of the Service I desire to return home but under the Circumstances I could hardly expect to remain their in peace. and owing to this fact I am Still willing to render all the service I can to the Gen. Gov.. and especially to Ky believeing that a Independent Organization properly conducted would do more to rid the Country of these unprincipled. Cutthroats. then a Regt of U. S. S. Could do Gov,, by Gen Orders &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup"> c</hi></hi> I am anctious to try the experiment. it is certainly known to you that the above mentioned County as well as the adjoining Counties<pb/>
<lb/>have been infested allmost ever since the war began by Guerillas and out laws. Commiting depredations of every carracter. to be conceived of. I propose to arm and mount a Squad of Old Soldiers who have Served three years and men who I know will respect the rights of Civil Citizens I would have no other. I can assure you Gov,, that if allowed to commence this that notwithstanding the Conduct of other like organizations that in ever instance the rights and property of Citizens will be respected and as far as possible protected against ^the acts of all unlawful carricters &amp;^ all irregular Soldiers.</p>
<p>I am sure that a company of the kind properly conducted will meet the approbation of the Citizens in the Locality</p>
<p>hoping this may be favorable Considered -- and permission Granted me to proceed if this is worthy of notice please answer</p>
<p>By Your Excellency -- 
<lb/>I have the honor to
<lb/>be very respectfully
<lb/>Your Obedient humble Servt
