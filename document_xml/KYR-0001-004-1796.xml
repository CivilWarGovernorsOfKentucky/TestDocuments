<lb/>My dear. Cousin</p>
<p>Yours of the 17<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> was received yesterday and I assure you it was read with much pleasure. When I wrote you last I fully expected to have been on my way home before this. but it seemes I am doomed to disapointment. I now fear it will be some time before there is a general release of prisoners. I hear now that there will be no general release untill the Army west of the river has surrendered. There are some leaving this place evry day on special releases procured for them by their friends. it is don in this way the prisoners name with some good union mans approval or recomendation is fforwarded to the Prisedent who signs his release and sends it to the prisoner. Have you not some good friend whom you could get to procure mine? it would be the greatest favor mortal could confer, and cost but little trouble. If I should be so lucky as ever to get out of this place I will call on your <hi rend="str">friends</hi> relatives in Hernando with pleasure it will be directly on my rout home. I hope &amp; trust the day may not be far distant when I can return to the <hi rend="underline">much</hi> <hi rend="underline">loved</hi> <hi rend="underline">mother</hi> <hi rend="underline">brothers</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">sisters</hi> from whom I have been so long seperated It seems to me now they are about all that is worth living for in this world at the present. I will bring this ^to^ a close excuse all mistakes.. Write me soon and let me know if you can do any thing for me in the matter above mentioned. I hope you can without puting yourself to any inconvenience. Write soon and believe me as ever your true friend and cousin Henry L Howze -- </p>
