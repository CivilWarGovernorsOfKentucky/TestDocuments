<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the request of Lafayette Bingham I write to you giving you the date and amount of a Judgment in our court against him for tipling.</p>
<p>The Judgment is for $60- and was rendered at the <date when="1859-09">September Term 1859</date>.</p>
<p>He says he had license at the time the offense was committed and was fined because he sold the whiskey on the election ground <hi rend="str">and</hi> instead of at his grocery. He is in hopes you may be able to procure a remission of the fine while you are at Frankfort</p>
<p>We had a glorious union meeting at the Court house last monday it being County Court day, the house was crowded and much enthusiasm was manifested by the crowd, no news of importance</p>
<p>Yours truly
<lb/>G. M. Adams Jr.<pb/></p>
