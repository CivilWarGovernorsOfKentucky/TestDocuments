<lb/>Gov. Bramlette</p>
<p>I have delayed for^war^ding my petition in consequence of Morgans late raid, fearing it might be cut off in its transit to you I could have extended the list of names to it, indeffinitely, but supposed it unnecessary to get more than I have obtained- The Jurymen live mostly in parts of the County remote from that in which I reside-(town) and I consequently failed to see them all- They would all however have doubtless signed it, with possibly, one of two exceptions- But these exceptions would not have been upon the ground that they believed that the fine should not be remitted- upon that point there seems to be Entire unanimity of opinion in my favor, and I flatter myself that your action in the case will be consonant with this opinion</p>
<p>W. L. Conklin- member of the late Legislature of Ky. &amp; who was my counsel in the trial, told me he would write you, giving some of the particulars of the case-</p>
<p>Enclosed you will find a copy of the Judgement &amp; verdict.-</p>
<p>I am Very Respectfully
<lb/>Your Obt servt
