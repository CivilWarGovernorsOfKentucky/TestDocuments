   <p>To his excellency
<lb/>Gov. J, F, Robinson</p>
<p>Your petitioners would state that at the <date when="--08">August</date> term of the Carroll Circut Court Jas. S Clark was fined the sum of 20$ &amp; cost for gaming. The circumstances were these, in passing by where men were gaming and being young and somewhat intoxicated at the time was bantered to play and did so to the amount of <hi rend="underline">25 cents</hi> and then quit the game, -- Your petitioners beleive his case one deserving executive clemency, and pray you to remit the same as we do not beleive he will engage in anything of the kind again. Your petitioners would further state that said Clark declined a defence upon the ground that he was guilty<pb/>
<lb/>to the extent stated above, and therefore would not plead not guilty.</p>
