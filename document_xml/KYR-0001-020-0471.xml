<lb/>A B Stivers
<lb/>Dear sir</p>
<p>I received your letter in due season &amp; should have answered it long ago -- &amp; would have done so but expected to start down to Frankfort every day, but it seems Just as I was going to start I have been disappointed &amp; by those I did not expect -- </p>
<p>I will now write &amp; hope that what I have said will be a suffcient apology for my seeming neglect, and even now I do not know what to write -- Estill is for the Union if she can stay in &amp; have her rights protected &amp; is willing to concede something for the good of the resident of the states -- but the north have transgressed a good ways in our rights, however our union is very dear to us &amp; should not be thrown aside on account of any trivial matter you know my views &amp; the views of Estill County -- our County seems to be willing to trust you without an expression of her sentiments this is of course flattering to you<pb/>
<lb/>&amp; will prompt you to look to the interest of this state --, Your family are well -- now near -- send me a paper occasionally</p>
<p>Respectfully &amp;c
<lb/>Robt Riddell J<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi></p>
<p>At the <date when="1860-06">June Term 1860</date> of the Estill Circuit Court Isaac Johnson was fine $20= besides cost for gaming, the matter was very trivial &amp; Ike you know is not a gambler. we sent a petition to the governor to remit it he respited it as I understand &amp; it is now due. &amp; The securities will have it to pay unless it is remitted, now I want you to go in person &amp; get the governor to remit it, it ought to be done, all other fines of this county have been remitted &amp; Ike is not asked to pay his fine, dont fail</p>
<p>Yours &amp;c
<lb/>Robert Riddell Jr</p>
