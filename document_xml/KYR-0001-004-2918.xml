<lb/>Governor. Thos. E Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the present term of this court Charles Baker of Cadiz Ky confessed Judgmt or plead guilty to a charge of unlawfully taking a horse without felonious intent, &amp; agreed with the Comths Atty to fix the fine at $200 for which amt, Judgement was rendered. The facts are as I am informed and believe that Baker was a soldier in the Rebel Army, as Such under orders, took the horse as charged. I do not think he could have been convicted on trial, but living 20 miles distant &amp; the case not being ready, he plead guilty under the advice of his <hi rend="str">advice</hi> father A. Baker of Cadiz Ky who will pay the fine if not remited. The deft owns no property &amp; has been rather dissipated and reckless until Since he left the army. his father at whose instance I write is a most excellent citizen, and will have to pay the fine for his Son or Suffer him to be imprisoned. I think under the circumstances he Should be relieved of all except costs &amp; fees. I know Mr A. Baker well &amp; take please in saying that I never knew a more <unclear>up</unclear>standing &amp; honest man.</p>
<p>Most Respectfully
<lb/>R T Petree<pb/></p>
