<lb/>His Exclly Gov. Robinson.
<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>It is now more than twelve months, since the appointment of Quarter Master General was tendered me by Gov. Magoffin. A hostile army was then encamped upon the soil of the state and I accepted the office at great personal inconvenience believing that no good citizen had a right to refuse his services to the Commonwealth at a moment of such peril. When the invading force was driven from our territory, I tendered my resignation, but the Governor refused to accept it. At my own suggestion I was then retired to the peace establishment and a nominal salary.</p>
<p>But in August last the state being again threatened with invasion I was <hi rend="str">in regard to</hi> recalled to active service and have since been entirely occupied by the duties of my office. The state is now again and I<pb/>
<lb/>trust permanently, free from the presence of an enemy. My private affairs have suffered much from my absence. The condition of my family imperatively requires my presence at home. And in addition my health still greatly enfeebled by recent illness is not such as to promise a speedy restoration of strength.</p>
<p>I therefore beg leave to tender you my resignation to take effect on the <date when="--11-01">1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> of November</date> prior to which time I hope to be well enough to visit Frankfort with a view to a final settlement of my accounts.</p>
<p>Be pleased sir to accept my thanks for the uniform courtesy and kindness I have received at your hands.</p>
<p>I am very Respectfully
<lb/>Your friend &amp; obdt servt.
<lb/>W A Dudley</p>
