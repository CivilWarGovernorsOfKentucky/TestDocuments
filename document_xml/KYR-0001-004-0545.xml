<lb/>Dear Father and Mother,</p>
<p>I again address you these few lines to inform you How I am. I am Still in Hopsital and have done no duty Since I wrote you last, but I think I am improving Slowly. I have been quite weak, and feeble during the winter. I am great hopes that I will get well again. I hope these lines may find you, and all my Relatives, well when they may reach your hands. I wrote a letter to you Some time ago in Answer to sister Margarets letters but have had no answer as yet I think it a good long while Since I have heard from you I am very anxious to hear from you and to learn how things are Progressing. I have no important news to write to you. It is expected that our Regiment will remain here until we are ordered North to be mustered out of the Service<pb/></p>
<p>We have five months to Serve from to day and then our three years Service will expire. I Should very much like to see you both, and my brothers and Sisters after I am mustered out, If circumstances are favorable for me to do so. which I hope they may be I Shall wait with all anxiety to hear from you upon the Subject. Give my love and Respects to my Brothers and Sisters and all my Relatives, write Soon accept my love for yourselves</p>
<p>I Remain Your
<lb/>Most devoted Son
<lb/>John W. Brookover</p>
<p>To
<lb/>Richard and Isabella Brookover</p>
