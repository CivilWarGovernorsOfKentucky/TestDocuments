   <p>House Representatives
<lb/>His Excellency Governor
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramlett</p>
<p>I hope I will be pardoned for taking this matter of again calling your attention to a matter in which I feel some interest and that interest grows and if the fact that the soldiers in the United States Army from Allen County. think it is a matter of Justice to them. More than one half of the 52<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> Ky. Vol. are from Allen County. Nearly one half of the 9<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky. Vol. <unclear/> from the same County. and among all the Vo<hi rend="underline">l</hi> furnished from said County. There has not yet been a field officer in either Reg. They think that after furnishing neerly enough men for a Reg. they at least ought to have as a matter of justice &amp; right ^are field officer^ when they ben as good material shown upon many a hard fought battle field as exists in the Army of the United States. The appointment of any important men from the County would give entire<pb/>
<lb/>satisfaction. My opinion is that office of Maj. could not be filled by a more competent person than Capt. J. D. Gilliam Co (B,) who has had the experience of two years in the service, and is a most excellent &amp; gallant officer though there are other gentlemen in the Reg. from the County that could fill the office with ability. I make these suggestions in order that you may take these facts into consideration when a Maj shall be commissioned for the Reg. -- Knowing that the feelings &amp; wishes of the Loyal people of the glorious little County of Allen will always be weighed with due consideration by the present Executive.</p>
<p>I have the Honor to be
<lb/>Yours Respectfully
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Jno J. Gatewood</hi></p>
