<lb/>Hon B. Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>There is a case pending in the Madison Circuit Court, the Com. vs Christopher Arvin &amp; B. F. Richardson. This is a case of assault upon Solon M Harris <hi rend="str">with</hi> (as alledged) with intent to kill. A civil suit was decided at our March term, going to Harris 1100$ damages. and the costs. Now this case falls very heavily upon the <hi rend="underline">Fathers</hi> of these two young men, who are their securities The old men are <hi rend="str">men</hi> of high character for piety honesty and good behavior, but they are men of moderate me^a^ns. <hi rend="str">The</hi> ^part of their^ witnesses for the defence are now in the army and for this reason Goodloe gave them a continuance at the march term, yet each continuance costs these old men about 50$ which is very heavy these hard times. </p>
<p>Now it will be matter for you to determine<pb/>
<lb/>whether their is a case for executive clemency or not, whether these old men have not <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> already suffered enough over these wild and erring sons. Whether the young men have not become sufficiently penitent by draging their aged parents before the Court, and having them <unclear/> in damages. on account of a drunken frolic perhaps aggravated by some previous difficulty.</p>
<p>I have been requested to make a statement of the above facts which I believe to be true. Boath parties are my personal friends. and in fact distantly related to me. I do not desire therefore to become a partizan in the matter. I am satisfied however after looking over the whole ground your own good judgement will prompt you to do what is right in the matter,</p>
<p>Remember me kindly to Cousin Ann and your family, Accept for yourself the kindest regards of your friend</p>
