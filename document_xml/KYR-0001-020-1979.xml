<lb/>Hon Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Frankfort Ky</p>
<p>Accept, My Dear, Governor, my thanks for the prompt appointment of me, a notory as requested. The documents are safe to hand and in the right time for some work I had to do under the Commision.</p>
<p>One more favor My Dear Governor, I have to ask of you, It is that you may find it consistent with your feelings to speedily give a pardon to Hauserman, He is an old man and is not guilty of larceny, though convicted for it, All the<pb/>
<lb/>Jury who convicted him have applied to you for his pardon, and that My Dear Governor is basis enough for you to send a pardon upon even is I nor any one else made any appeal in his behalf. Hoping that the old man may come down on an early train from Frankfort I am</p>
<p>yours truly
<lb/>R. T Durrett</p>
