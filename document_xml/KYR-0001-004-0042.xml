   <p>To his Exclllency Thos E Bramlet
<lb/>Governor of the State of Kentucky</p>
<p>We your peitioners citizens of Carroll County beg leave to represent to your Excellency that at the late August term of the Caroll Circuit Court our neighbor G W Birkshire was fined by the Honorable Judge Druin the Sum of fifty dollars on an Indictment for Shooting with a pistol at G S Blessing We would further state that said Birkshire is a man of but little means and cannot without great inconvenience pay said fine and further that the Shooting was done while in a state of great excitement and that at the time the said Blessing gave the lie direct to Birkshire in regard to his statement that he was robed a few nights before by a company of Southern soldiers who entered his house and robed him of 250 dollars Said Blessing was not hit or wounded by the Shooting but the Judge could not comply with the law without inflicting the above fine of fifty dollars</p>
<p>We your petitioners in view of the whole premises believe this to be a propper case for the exercise of Executive Clemency and respectfully ask your Excellency to remit the fine or so much thereoff as you may deem propper</p>
