<lb/>Lieut Col. E, R, Weir
<lb/>Commanding Post
<lb/>Hopkinsville
<lb/>Col:</p>
<p>A Matter was brought before me to day, which I think partly demands our consideration; Especially when it is in this section of country, where <hi rend="underline">treason</hi> has in the past and even now, showes itself so plain -- </p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Court</hi> is now in <hi rend="underline">session</hi>, and a reble Court, out and out, Judge and all -- I came very near having some troubles with the court about 2 men belonging to the 48<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Vols, who were in jail and had been demanded by the Military at Russellville, whereupon they pointedly refused to give them up; And in consequence of their stubborn, <hi rend="underline">secesh</hi> nature I had to call out about half the company The men were then acquited, and peace restord, But now, I find that all the Judges who were over the <hi rend="underline">poles</hi> at August Election, have<pb/>
<lb/>been indited by the Grand Jury, by this court simply, for conforming to C Johnsons orders which were the same as Col Festers and not allowing <hi rend="underline">no</hi> <hi rend="underline">traitor</hi> to cast a vote, or a man who had intentionally and wilfully aided the so, called Confederate States, of America, or <hi rend="underline">Provisional</hi> Government of Ky</p>
<p>The Judges only conformed to Military and as the State is under <hi rend="underline">Martial</hi> <hi rend="underline">Law</hi>, above civil law I cant see how the Civil Court can indite, the Judges of the Election; And as such was occasioned by the Military, I think that the Military ught to support, the ones who have been wronged by the civil authorities -- I would like to interfere, if I can reasonably do so, in behalf of the Judges of the Election, and consequently consult your better Judgement; and will await your approval or disapproval, to my ideas</p>
<p>Your Obdt Servt
