   <p>Petitioners ^Nathan Bibb. General Douglas &amp;^ state that at the <date when="1863-06">June term 1863</date> of the Fayette Circuit Court <hi rend="str">the</hi> a bail bond executed by them as sureties of Emily who was indicted for larcey. They immediately after hearing that Emily had failed to attend had her arrested &amp; delivered to the sheriff of Fayette Co who put her in jail. At the <date when="1863-08">August term 1863</date>, on the first day of court a judgment was entered against them without the knowledge of their counsel, who after it was entered ^&amp; at same term^ moved to set aside the judg under the provisions of rec criminal code, said motion was overruled by the court as it was made too late. As they delivered the prisoner to the sheriff as soon as they learned she had forfeited her bond they pray your Excellency to remit said judgment.</p>
<p>The foregoing statements are substantially true, and as there seems to have been a Mistake if it can be properly done, I hope your Excellency will remit.</p>
