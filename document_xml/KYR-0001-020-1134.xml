<lb/>Hon B Magoffin:
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I sent you last week several Petitions numerously signed in favor of Joseph Blackwell now lying in Jail under a Judgment of the Circuit Court to pay a fine of $200. Some of his famliy are sick and he is suffering severely from confinement. He is a poor man.</p>
<p>I also enclosed you letters from John G Carlisle Esqr and R Simmons Esqr. The Commonwealths Attorney &amp; ten of the Jurors (I was prevented seeing the others) signed the Petition.</p>
<p>I would very respectfully solicit an early favorable response to the Petition. I assure you with all sincerity that there never was a Juster case for Executive inter-<pb/>
<lb/>position. Mr Carlisle has kindly referred to me in his letter and I pledge you solemnly that it will not only be clemency but <hi rend="underline">Justice</hi> to pardon Blackwell. I know Blackwell and I know his accuser. Had not the trial, been pressed we would have shown the Jury what the ^latter is^ <hi rend="str">case</hi>. <hi rend="underline">I truly believe </hi><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="str">him</hi></hi><hi rend="underline"> ^Blackwell^ innocent</hi>. Ignorantly he neglected to speak to a lawyer in time to have his subpoenas issued with diligence.</p>
<p>With great regard &amp; respectfully requesting an immediate answer, allow me to sign myself</p>
<p>Your Obt Servant
<lb/>John.P. Harrison
<lb/>Address Box 303. Cov. Ky.</p>
<p>I will refer to John.W. Stevenson, John O Harrison of Bullit (my relative) -- or send you further documents if neccessary.</p>
