<p>Dear Sir. At the late <date when="--03">March term</date> of our Circuit Court a Judgment was rendered for the Commonwealth against St. Clair Ogg for $25 -- for standing a Stud horse Hercules without first obtaining a license in the year <date when="1863">1863</date>. He had obtained and paid the Clerk for his license during the Season, but prior to obtaining it he had allowed his horse to serve serveral mares. For that service he had been paid nothing. His Stallion was stolen by the Rebels, and soon afterward he got his arm cut off by a threshing machine_ He is poor and I hope you will ask Gov Bramlette to remit the fine against him It is proper to do so.</p>
<p>Your friend
