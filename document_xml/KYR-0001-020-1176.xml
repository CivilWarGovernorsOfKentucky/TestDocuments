<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>B MaGoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the request of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> A Brawner I state that I have know for ^several years^ Wash Eblin who is now &amp; has been in confinement in the Penitentiary for some time for the crime of murder Previous to his Committing the act for which he is now undergoing confinement he was very dissipated and in a measure worthless though regarded by all who know him in harmless and unoffending when not disturbed or excited Since his confinement he has conducted himself well has now better health than usual and I think sufficiently restored in body and mind to make a good living if liberated</p>
<p>It will afford me pleasure to see him pardoned</p>
<p>Your obt servant
<lb/>W C Sneed<pb/></p>
<p>Gov B MaGoffin
