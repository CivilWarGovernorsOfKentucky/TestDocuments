   <p>To His Excy Gov'r Bramlett</p>
<p>Your petitioner, Augustus Rosenbaum states that he was indicted in The Franklin circuit court for selling a quart of liquor or some small amount to a U.S. Soldier, and that he was required to give bail in the sum of two hundred dollars for his appearance at said Court -- He states that at the time his health was bad, and that before court, on account of his health that he returned to Europe to recruit his health, and that altho He had employed coucil to defend him, that in his absence his bail was forfeited, he says that no judgt was obtained on the indictment because he was not guilty, and that the Com'th was defeated on the indictment, yet because he was absent that he was fined on the recognisance, the afsd sum of two hundred dollars -- Wherefore in as much as he is a poor man, illey able to pay said forfeiture and was not convicted of the offense, and was compelled to go To Europe on account of bad health and other business he prays to have said fine remitted and will ever pray &amp; c -- and that the Judg't of L. W. Harrod his surety be also remitted -- </p>
