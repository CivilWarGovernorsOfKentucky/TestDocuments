<lb/>Gov. Robinson
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Should Major Moreau be broken by court martial the appointment of my friend Geo. Womack in his place would greatly gratify me. I know Mr Womack well and know him to be a high toned gentleman and that he would make a good officer. He aided me in raising my old fraction of a Regiment and would have been the Lt. Colonel <unclear>but</unclear> the consolidation prevented it. Thinking <hi rend="str">the good of</hi> the good of the State required it he cheerfully gave way. Take his claim into consideration and if you can commission him you would confer a great favor upon</p>
<p>Yours truly
<lb/>Richard T. Jacob.</p>
