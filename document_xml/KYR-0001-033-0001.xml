<p>The killing in this case was proved by <hi rend="underline">one</hi> witness. There were one or two circumstances which went towards corrobberating the statements of this one witness. The defense offered to prove that deceased, some time after the killing, say one half hour, but after the parties had <hi rend="underline">seperated</hi> &amp; the dft ^had been^ arrested in another part of the city -- stated that another man had shot him This was twenty four hours before he died -- was not a dying declaration, nor offered as such &amp; the court excluded the testimony as being no part of the "resgestae" </p>
<p>In view of these facts I recommend the prisoner to your excellency for clemency</p>
