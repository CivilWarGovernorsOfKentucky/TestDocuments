<lb/>Hon. Jas. H. G. Bush
<lb/>My dear sir.</p>
<p>About two weeks ago I wrote to the Governor asking him to remit a forfeited bond (bail) against myself &amp; Thos. Turner. The application was approved by Mr Dury or Comths Atty. The following are the facts. a fellow named Kincade a soldier in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky. Cav. was indicted at the <date when="1863-02">Feb. term 1863</date> for bigamy. He was arrested shortly after &amp; after the close of the term put in jail &amp; kept there some time when his father came &amp; employed us to defend him. We got him out of jail went on his bail bond for $400 -- for his appearance at the <date when="1863-08">Ensuing August term.</date> Just before that term the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky. was ordered away from here taking Kincade, leaving Turner &amp; myself in the lurch. We begged off at the <date when="1863-08">Augt term 1863</date> &amp; <date when="1864-02">Feb. term 1864</date> but at our last <date when="1864-08">Augt. term ^1864^</date> Judgt. went against us ^for $400. -- ^ &amp; I myself paid off the comths Atty's 30 per cent. I wish you would go to the Governor &amp; get the Comths portion of the forfeiture remitted. In the hurry of his business he has doubtless overlooked my letter &amp; if it were not for the near approach of our Circt. Court (next monday) I would come down &amp; personally attend to it. &amp; I only ask your good offices in this matter because you have always been so kind a friend, in matters where I had least right to expect it. that I am emboldened in this thing.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hensley asked me to say that I join in<pb/>
<lb/>his petition sent you for his relief, in having a special law passed removing his case from Wolfe to this County.</p>
<p>Very respy your friend
