<p>Hon Thos E Bramlet Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Inclosed I send you the Bond of George Renacker with J D &amp; William Renacker as his sureties the nature of the Bond you will see. This Bond was forfeited by George Renacker's failing to attend for trial. His sureties at a subsequent term of the court produced George into court_ again entered into a Recognizance for his appearance at the next term of the court, at which term he appeared &amp; was tried for the offence for which he was held by the Bond taken by the Justices of the Peace and tried &amp; fined the sum of $50, Now I hope it will appear to your Honor but just to remit so much of the Judgment against J D &amp; W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Renacker as you are by law empowered to do They are both good citizens It is true they are able to pay the judgment &amp; the only reason that it has not been paid long ago is, that the Renackers &amp; the clerk were both of the opinion that the fine had been remitted by some former Gov, but no evidence of the fact can be found in the office -- The prayer for remittence is based alone on the fact that George was afterwards tried for the offence &amp; fined $50. Now if you are of opinion that Justice would demand <hi rend="str">all</hi> the payment of the fine of $50 you are asked to remit all but $50 but it is hoped by the renackers that you will feel justified in remitting the whole<pb/>
<lb/>Except the Attys fees which has been paid as is shown by the records. I could get every man in the county to sign a petition to you praying for a remition of the judgment &amp; will <hi rend="str">do it <unclear/></hi> send to you a petition signed some of the officers of the county if required I am with great Respect yours &amp;</p>
<p>W. T Simmons for
<lb/>J D &amp; W Renacker</p>
<p>Gov Thos E Bramlet</p>
