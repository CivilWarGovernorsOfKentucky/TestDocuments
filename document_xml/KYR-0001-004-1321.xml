<p>Personally appeared before me a Notary public in and for the county aforesaid <hi rend="underline">Joshua Pack</hi> and made oath as follows=</p>
<p>I formerly resided in Williamstown Grant Co. Ky., where I lived for many years. Have lived in Covington for <hi rend="str">nearly</hi> ^between 2 and^ 3 years past. I have known John Beasely, the main witness who testified in the cases for selling ale, ginger wine &amp;c. to minors, against <hi rend="underline">Mr. Henry Crout, </hi>and known him well, and known his general character, for about 7 years. When I first became acquainted with him he lived in Grant County, and was employed to drive a stage. When I came to Covington I found him here: often saw him about the tavern which I kept -- the "Henry Clay House" -- situate near the Rail Road depot. I can testify, and I think without any prejudice against Mr. Beasely, that he is an immoral, untruthful and dishonest man. His general character in Grant county where he lived; and here also, so far as I have known it, is that he would not be believed on oath -- Especially would he not be believed by those who are best acquainted with him.<pb/>
<lb/>He -- Beasely -- is a worthless man. I rarely ever knew him to <hi rend="underline">voluntarily</hi> pay an honest debt.</p>
<p>I informed Mr. Crout of what I knew of the man, and what I could prove about him, after he had testified in the cases against him, and judgments had been rendered against him.</p>
<p>Beasely deserted from the military service, in which he was employed, a short time since, and ran away; but he was arrested as a deserter; and, I have heard, sent away somewhere=</p>
<p>I lived near neighbor to where Mr. Henry Crout kept his house for some time. I believe Mr. Crout to be a thoroughly honest, disinterested, and law-abiding man. Have frequently been in his house but never seen any violation of law done, or permitted to be done, there=</p>
<p>Joshua Pack</p>
<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me by Joshua Pack <date when="1864-11-28">Nov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> 28<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> 1864</date></p>

<lb/>N. P. K. C. Ky=<pb/></p>
<p>I was a juror in <hi rend="underline">two</hi> of the cases referred to in the foregoing papers; and, in making up our verdicts in the same, we had to be governed exclusively by the proof adduced to us. No evidence as to the moral character of <hi rend="underline">John Beasely</hi> -- the main witness -- and especially as to his character for truthfulness, was produced at either of said trials. But I have since seen the sworn statement of Mr. Joshua Pack -- whom I know -- and I can state that had such evidence been produced at the trials, and before the verdicts, my conduct officially in these cases would have been very materially modified by it.</p>
<p>J. W. Lowry</p>
<p>I was also on the above 2 cases as a co-juror in each with Mr. Lowry. and I fully concur in the above statement. I thought the cases hard ones from the beginning doubly so since I have read Pack's affidavit</p>
<p>Thomas Robson</p>
<p>Beasely being the prominent witness I felt constrained as a juror to find a verdict on his testimony; but I do think this case merits the clemency of the Governor.</p>

<p>The petitionr has been long and favorable ^known^ to <hi rend="str">me</hi> us as a gentleman, good citizen, &amp; law-abiding man</p>
