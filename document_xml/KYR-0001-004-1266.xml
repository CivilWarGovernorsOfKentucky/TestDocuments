<lb/>Col P. B. Hawkins -- </p>
<p>Col -- yesterday I was called on by the wife of Jas L Chapman to Sine a petition addressed to the Govenor of Kentucky asking for the release of Chapman from the Penitentiary of Ky -- the charges agains Chapman was for horse stealing -- the facts as I learn them are as follows -- Chapman was robed of four horses and his wagon which left him without horses or nearly <hi rend="str">so</hi> so he took the horse for which he was penitentioned but said ^he took^ the horse in self defence -- the law does not bear him out in his conduct but being a mater of necessity he was driven to do so -- <hi rend="str">I</hi> -- you will do Mrs Chapman the Kindness to see Govenor Bramlett on the subject of her Husbands release if you think you can approach him Chapman belonged to my Regement at the time he was convicted -- he says that it was not his intention to violate Law <hi rend="str">but</hi> but only claiming his own</p>
<p>I am yours &amp;c
