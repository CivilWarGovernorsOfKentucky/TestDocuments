<lb/>Dear Governor</p>
<p>We herewith enclose you a petition for the remission of two fines against Henry C. Miller. The statements in his affidavit are correct. Miller has recently married and gone to farming and seems disposed to become a steady man_ The Searcy family are numerous and have been very bitter towards him since the difficulty for which he was tried and acquainted, and we are satisfied it would not have been safe for him to ^have^ gone unarmed where they were -- </p>
<p>We were not representing him at the trial of the indictments in which he was fined, and are not aware that these facts were properly before the Jury -- We think the fines were wrongfully imposed and hope your Excellency will remit them.</p>
<p>We are very truly
<lb/>Your friends
<lb/>M R &amp; T B Hardin<pb/></p>
<p>His Excellency
<lb/>B Magoffin
<lb/>Gov of Kentucky
<lb/>Frankfort Ky</p>
