<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E, Bramlet,
<lb/>Governor,,</p>
<p>Some five years ago one Gabriel Endicott, was convicted in the Lawrence Court for manslaughter, in killing David Justice, who, was my Brotherinlaw, I took the lead in employing counsel to assist in prosecuting said Endicott, we employed Col, L. T. Moore, Hon<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. L, W, Andrews and others; -- the case being as strangely made by proof as could be produced, left it only a case of circumstantial evidence; taking all things into consideration I am satisfied, the ends of<pb/>
<lb/>Justice; and cause of humanity, would be better, attained by pardoning Endicott, than keeping, him longer, confined to obtain this end, I have united, in a petition, of my neighbours, and have no doubt the entire, population of the county, would if applied to unite, in the prayer for his pardon; I am sir very respectfully your</p>
<p>obedient Servant
<lb/>William Vinson</p>
