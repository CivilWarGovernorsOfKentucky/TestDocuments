   <p>To His Excellency, the Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your petitioner, Washington Lewis, respectfully states that he is a free boy of Color, about 18 years of age; that he was Employed by Marshal Woodson, a free man of Color, to assist him in attending to his grocery on the corner of 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> &amp; Madison Streets in Louisville Ky, where your petitioner has been Employed ever since.</p>
<p>That about five weeks ago said Woodson Engaged to make a trip as Steward on a steamboat, the "Belle Creole," which went to Helena Arkansas, and said Woodson shipped on her, leaving your petitioner in charge of his grocery. Your petitioner states that for some months before his Employer went on said boat, he kept his grocery having your petitioner to assist him, and during the time, said Woodson was occasionally visited at his house by some of negro men acquaintances, who by permission of Woodson had the privilege of going in &amp; out of Woodson's bed room over the grocery</p>
<p>While Woodson was away as aforesaid (and he is still absent from Louisville) some of the Negro visitors came to his room aforesaid and while there they played cards. Your petitioner did not know, nor does he yet know that they gambled for anything; and he was induced not to object to their occupying the room because they had always done so theretofore, by his Employer, Woodson's permission.</p>
<p>However, on the <date when="1862-10-20">20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> August 1862</date>, Woodson being absent, as above stated, your petitioner was indicted in the City Court of Louisville, for allowing gaming in his house, the premises aforesaid, and<pb/>
<lb/>on the <date when="1862-09-03">3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> Sept 1862</date>, was tried on said indictment and fined on account thereof the sum of $200.</p>
<p>Your petitioner begs leave humbly to present to your Excellency this petition and prays that the Commonwealths portion of said fine be remitted.</p>
<p>He will be compelled $60 thereof being the 30 per cent, allowed by law to the Commonwealth's attorney, also costs to the further amount of $7.<hi rend="sup">25</hi>. And, as your petitioner is informed, he can be imprisoned in the City workhouse at 75<hi rend="sup">cts</hi> per day until said fine &amp; costs are thereby paid. Your petitioner states that he is poor, has no means &amp; is dependant on his daily labor for his support. He has not wilfully violated the law; he did not know the persons were violating the law, when they visited his Employer's house, and as he is not only under age but was in the Employment of another and reaped no benefit, he humbly prays your Excellency to remit the Commonwealth's portion of the aforesaid fine, &amp; he ever will &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi></p>
