   <p>His Excellency Gov. Magoffin
<lb/>Governor!</p>
<p>For two years I have been a regularly licensed Tavern Keeper in the City of Louisville. I assure your Excellency, that I have never allowed a game of Cards in my House, to be played for money or property, further than in one or more instances games have been played by persons, who at the end of the game required the loser of the game to treat <unclear>at her</unclear> party at my Bar. --.</p>
<p>A man who committed outrages at my House (for which he was fined in the Police Court) was one of the parties engaged in one of these games for Liquor.</p>
<p>After I have caused him to be arraigned for the above mentioned bad Conduct at my House, he had me indicted for allowing gaming in my House. In the final hearing<pb/>
<lb/>the jury were compelled to find me guilty under the proof. The jury fixed the fine at the lowest sum provided for in the statute ($200.00) In addition to the fine the costs will be very heavy. -- </p>
<p>The witnesses all testified that I did not allow cards to be played in my House for money.</p>
<p>The penalty is very sever for even the offence of allowing gaming in a house for money. I did not know that I was violating the law in allowing little games for treats to be played for it is custom in every public house in Louisville that has a Bar attached to it!</p>
<p>It is impossible for me to pay the fine, I therefore earnestly and most respectfully ask your Excellency to remit the fine.</p>
<p>I have never knowingly violated the law and will here after carefully seek to avoid its violation.</p>

<p>The proof in the case Established the facts as they are set out in the Petition. -- Mr. Schlick is a very orderly clever man &amp; keeps a respectable Hotel in this city. He is in Moderate circumstances &amp; in these times of scarcity both of Money &amp; provissions I am satisfied it would oppress him greatly to pay the fine</p>
