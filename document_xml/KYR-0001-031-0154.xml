<lb/>Hon. Preston Sparks
<lb/>Dear Sir;</p>
<p>I write to ask a favor at your hands, which I doubt not you have the ability to confer, and which I have every reason to believe you will exert yourself to accomplish.</p>
<p>It is, that you see the Governor and exert your influence with him to procure me the office of Notary Public.</p>
<p>Concerning my loyalty I need say nothing to you -- since you know what I have borne as flagmaster here, and how I have constantly stood up for the Union and constitution against all foes from all quarters.</p>
<p>By a little friendly exertion on your part, you might be the means of affording me timely help from embarrassment by procuring me an office which, I think might be made remunerative at this place.</p>
<p>Truly Yours &amp;c.
<lb/>L. W. Bruce</p>
