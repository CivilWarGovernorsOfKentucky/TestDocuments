<lb/>Dear Governer</p>
<p>Do not become weary or impatient with me for my frequent troubling you or importuning you in behalf of others I deeply feel for the distress of our country in a finantial point of view; but more especially for the class who I petition for who are <hi rend="str">uterly</hi> uterly unable to pay their fines and may scearsly able to suport themselves and families -- ; the Cypernatian woman said to the <hi rend="underline">saviour</hi> in answer to his declaration "that it was improper to take the bed of the Children and thow it to the dogs -- " "ya Lord but the dogs should have the <hi rend="underline">Crums</hi> that fall from the <hi rend="underline">masters</hi> <hi rend="underline">table</hi>; so I hope you will do as that Good man did rather Grant my request for the faith that is in me than deny them in consequence of my frequent asking"</p>
<p>The claim or petition I send is from an honest poor hard working orderly man and his case is one of merit I believe I have not heard from the case of Richard meek I sent you about the <date when="1860-12-18">18th</date> or <date when="1860-12-20">20<hi rend="underline">th</hi> of <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>Decr</date><pb/>
<lb/>the Petition of W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Owsley is one of merit and the claim or Petition of Polly Ratliff I know is one of merit and that you may Know from the statement of the county atto who prosecuted the case (John Hawkins)</p>
<p>hopeing to hear from you in each of them favourably in a short time I remain with</p>
<p>very high esteem
<lb/>your friend and
<lb/>obt servant
<lb/>John M Burns</p>
