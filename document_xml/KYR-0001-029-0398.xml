<lb/>Hon. James. I Robinson, Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>During the Administration of Gov. Magoffin, I sent him a Petition -- to Remit Judgment, &amp;c. The Papers, sent in the Petition were lost, &amp; were never acted on by him. Last summer your attention was called to it, by our Senator J. B. Bruver, of this Town, and you granted a remission of the Judgment, of which the enclosed is a correct copy, except, the amount, which was left blank; but is now inserted -- $500, A copy of the Bond &amp; all the necessary papers, were sent in the Petition; but were lost out, and the letters of Remission, were of no validity, because no judgment had been rendered,</p>
<p>The Grayson Circuit Court, will be holden <hi rend="underline">next Monday, the </hi><date when="1863-05-11"><hi rend="underline">11</hi><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi><hi rend="underline"> May,</hi> </date>and I shall be there, and have Judgment entered against the securities. And request you to issue other letters -- dated on the <date when="--05-12">12<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> May</date> or after and send them to my Address, James G. Haswell, Hardinsburg, Breckenridge County Ky, that I may file it and suspend the Judgment,</p>
<p>The case is equally as meritorious as set out in the Petition, yea more so, The fees of the Commonwealths Attorney -- are secured, and by your action, you will save a helpless woman, with a large family of children from want.<pb/></p>
<p>Dear Governor</p>
<p>I take great pleasure in endorsing M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Haswell as a Lawyer of standing here and a gentleman -- What he says in his communication from his knowledge I am satisfied is true &amp; can be relied on -- </p>
<p>My partner M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Bruner who has been assisting M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Haswell in this matter is not now at home -- </p>
<p>Very resply
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Alf Allen</hi></p>
