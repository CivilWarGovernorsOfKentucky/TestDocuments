   <p>To His excellency
<lb/>The Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Patrick Kellar would respectfully represent, that at the <date when="1856-10">Oct term 1856</date> of the Bourbon Circuit Court, Andrew Moraraity was indicted for a misdemeanor; and a bench warrant issued for his arrest -- Your petitioner became his bail in the sum of one hundred dollars -- Said Morarraity failed to appear to answer said indictment, and by the usual proceedings judgment was rendered against your petitioner for the amount of said bond at the <hi rend="str">July</hi> <date when="1857-10">Oct term 1857</date> of said Court and execution issued thereon in Nov following -- without effect -- Recently another execution has issued and is in the hands of the sheriff of Bourbon County.</p>
<p>Your petitioner states that he is a poor man, dependant on his daily labor for the support of a large family, consisting of a wife and ten children -- all of the latter are dependant upon him for support except the eldest, a son who is now serving in the Federal Army in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Infantry -- </p>
<p>Your petitioner cannot pay said sum without, bringing distress upon<pb/>
<lb/>upon his family -- </p>

<p>Your petitioner, believing that his case is one proper for Executive Clemency, prays that so much of said bond may be remitted as the law will permit -- </p>
<p>Patr Kellar says he believes the statements of this petition are true -- </p>
