Your petitioner having taken counsel in the case, and having informed said counsel that, he had on <hi rend="underline">one</hi> occasion violated the law, he was advised to confess judgment, and did so, under the impression that the fine would be twenty dollars His Honor the Judge, not knowing the natue of the proof before the Grand Jury, entered a fine for Keeping a tippling house, to Wit; sixty dollars, to the great astonishment of your petitioner. Your petitioner would further state that, he does not Keep a tippling house: that he has violated the law in but one instance, And he most respectfully prays your Excellency to remit said fine which is recorded against him.</p>
