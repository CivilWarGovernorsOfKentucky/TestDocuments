<p>Mr. John Doyle, is among the last of our citizens whom I would be willing to admit, or could believe guilty of the charge as brought against him -- I Pass by his Business House at least Fourt times per day to my dwelling &amp; Back to my Business and a more industrious and orderly man, and a more reliable man can not be found in our city -- So will do I know his Law abiding and order loving, habits -- that I cannot for a moment believe him guilty. No man has had a better opportunity to testify to his spotless character than I have had during his Business at the corner of 5th &amp; green Sts. and I do really hope your Exelency will remit this unjust fame &amp; Believe me yours</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Tho</hi><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi><hi rend="underline"> M Hicks</hi></p>
<p>I concur, with the statement made by Col Hicks, as above </p>
<p><hi rend="underline">T. T. Spree</hi></p>
<p>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> J W Benson a near neighbor and constant customer of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dolyes cheerfully adds his testimony to that offered above</p>

<p><date when="1861-04-05"><hi rend="underline">April 5</hi><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi><hi rend="underline"> 1861</hi></date></p>
<p>I would state to your Excellency that Mr. John Doyle is well known to me, he is an honest &amp; worthy man &amp; I believe that the evidence adduced against him on the trial was from revengeful motives and if your Excellincy will remit his fine, you will be doing only an act, of justice to a deserving man -- </p>
<p>very respectfully &amp; truly
<lb/>your friend
<lb/>Robert Montgomery</p>
