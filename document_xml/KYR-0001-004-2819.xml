<lb/>To the Gov
<lb/>Dear sir</p>
<p>I enclose copy of record in a case when a Dutch Client of Mine was fined unjustly, if an unjust fine was ever inflicted I procurred copy of Record intending to appeal the Cause but the Bill of Exceptions is not fair and is Stronger against me than the testimony and I think it best to apply to you to remit the fine I feel confident that the testimony as written in this record is of a character that barely justifies the fine if strong enough for this purpose I never present a petition when I would not myself remit In this case the defendant <hi rend="underline">did</hi> not know he was violating law and discontinued the game when told it was improper to permit it You will do an act of justice in remitting it and oblige</p>
<p>Yours truly
<lb/>T. C. Campbell</p>
