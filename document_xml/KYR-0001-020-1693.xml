   <p>To his Excellency B Magoffin Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Affiant Greenberry G Hanson would respectfully state that at the <date when="--08">August term</date> of the Bracken Circuit Court he was indicted by the Grand jury of said Court, for permitting his fence to stand in the road, and at the <date when="--02">February</date> term of said court he was fined the sum of Three Hundred &amp; sixty five Dollars. He states that the indictment was procured through the malice and ill will of one of his neighbors, that the fence stands now and did stand at the time of the indictment just where it did stand, and has stood for the last sixteen or seventeen years. Affiant futher states that <unclear/> <unclear/> was a low place in the road, and a small branch run a cross the road, and about Sixteen or Seventeen years ago, he and his neighbor Hollis, put a culvert <hi rend="str">acro</hi> or small bridge across or over said branch, and each put one corner of their fence upon said bridge to protect the road, and keep the culvert from filling up, thus the fence has stood from that day to the present, the witnesses stated that one corner of his fence stood about twelve or eighteen inches into the road, but no more, that the said corner of the fence was put there to protect the road, and had stood stood there since it was first built, he admits that it may stand a few inches upon the road, but it is at a place that does not offer any obstruction, as it stood<pb/>
<lb/>upon the edge of the bridge, where it did not obstruct the travel.</p>
<p>He further states that the road is but very little used, and that part of the road has not been worked for the last four or five years, and is seldom used, he also states that there are many other places in the road, that is more obstructed than it is by his fence, he freely admitted to the jury that one corner of his fence, stood a few inches upon the road, but that it had stood in the same place for many years, and was put there by express agreement of the neighbors, he believes that the whole prosecution was through malice, and ill will. Your affiant had no intention of obstructing <unclear/> <unclear/> <unclear/> <unclear/> <unclear/> in any respect. He therefore prays that your Excellency will interpose your clemency, and remit said fine so far as is in your power to do.</p>
<p>G,, G. Hanson</p>
