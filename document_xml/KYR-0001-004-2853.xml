   <p>To His Excellency Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> T. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>The undersigned respectfully represent that they were, during the late rebellion, officers in the Army of the United States, and were at different times stationed on the Sandy River and in the adjacent country. They had full opportunity from their official positions of becoming fully acquainted with many of the Citizens of that part of Kentucky</p>
<p>They represent, (what is already doubtless well-known to your Excellency) that the late war, assumed in the Mountains a character of sanguinary personal strife, unknown in the more favored portions of the State. that private quarrels were avenged under the guise of military operations, and individual malice wreaked by parties acting ostensibly as soldiers.</p>
<p>They represent to your Excellency that <hi rend="underline">Elijah</hi> <hi rend="underline">Patrick</hi> (now a senator of this Commonwealth) was together with his brothers, particularly odious to Guerrillas and other lawless bands. That especially was he so to the <hi rend="underline">Harrises</hi>, a family formerly residing in Prestonsburg Ky.</p>
<p>That Elija Patrick was captured by Jack (or A. J) Harris and a party, and ordered by said Harris to immediate death in cold blood, and would have inevitably been put to death had not an unexpected<pb/>
<lb/>attack by Reuben Patrick, enabled him to make his escape. That the life of Elijah Patrick was in constant and eminent peril from s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Harris -- his property plundered and destroyed and his safety continually endangered. That it was a matter of public notoriety that whenever they met that one or the other must die</p>
<p>That being so hunted, harrassed, plundered and broken up by s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Harris, and feeling a constant apprehension of death at the hands of Harris, Elijah Patrick did shoot and Kill said Harris. For which shooting and Killing Elijah Patrick now stands indicted in the Circuit Court of Johnson County Kentucky -- </p>
<p>The facts above cited are notoriously public and well Known in the vicinity of Prestonsburg.</p>
<p>These petitioners therefore, in view of the Circumstances, and the aggravating and inj<hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>urious deportment of Harris and his endeavors to take the life of Patrick do pray that your Excellency will <hi rend="underline">pardon</hi> said Patrick and release him from said indictment -- Witness our hands at Frankfort Kentucky this <date when="1865-12-04">4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day December 1865</date>.</p>
