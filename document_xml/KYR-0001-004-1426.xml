   <p>To the Hon Thomas E Bramlette Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The petition of Willis D Lee who states that he is a hotel keeper and a resident of Dover Mason County Ky -- his age is 77 years and for 28 years of his life last past he has kept a public hotel in the state of Kentucky, and during all that time he has never intentionally violated the law, and has always to the best of his knowledge been particular in his observance of all that the law required of him in keeping a public house, and retailing spirituous liquors -- At the last <date when="1864-04">April</date> term of the Mason Circuit Court he was indicted by the grand jury, and at the <date when="1864-10">october</date> term of said court he was fined the sum of fifty dollars for the offense of selling liquors to <hi rend="underline">minors</hi></p>
<p>At the time said offense was alledged against him he was regularly licensed to retail spiritous liquors and many young men did buy liquor at his bar, but in every instance in which he sold to them, their appearance indicated that they were <hi rend="underline">men</hi> of <hi rend="underline">mature</hi> <hi rend="underline">age</hi> and he at the time beleived they were, and he has in no instance sold liquor to minors <hi rend="underline">knowingly</hi> unless by the consent of their parents or gaurdians</p>
<p>If he committed any offense against the law he did so ignorantly, and the therefore thinks that the fine inflicted by the court against him is a hardship, that the Governor ought to relieve him from and he therefore most respectfully asks that said fine be remitted</p>
<p>Willis D, Lee</p>
<p>State of Kentucky Mason County</p>
<p>Sworn to and subscribed by Willis D Lee before me a justice of the peace<pb/>
<lb/>for Mason County this <date when="1865-01-23">23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day of January 1865</date></p>
<p>Tho A Curran J P M C</p>
<p>To his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Dover Mason County Ky and vicinity respectfully join with the above named Willis D Lee in his petition to your Excellency to have the fine remitted which was imposed upon him by the Mason Circuit Court at its <date when="1864-10">last October</date> term -- because we believe that if he committed any offense against the law he did so ignorantly, and with no intention of violating the same -- </p>
