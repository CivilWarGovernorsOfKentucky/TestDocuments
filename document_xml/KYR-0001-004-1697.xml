   <p>To His Excellency Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E Bramlett
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>We the undersigned Citizens of Grant County would repsectfully state that the Grand Jury for this County Indicted at the <date when="1864-05">May Term of our Circuit Court for the year 1864</date> for Keeping a Tippling House one Hargus Gamble which said Indictment was tried at the <date when="1864-10">Oct Term 1864</date> of said Court and Gamble was found guilty and find sixty Dollars -- Now we are all neighbors and acquaintencs of s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Gamble and know him to be a sober, Industrious, Peacible quiet and law-abiding man -- that he had applied for and obtained a Government License and supposed that was all the authority that he required for selling Liquor -- we further state that he is a poor man, and not able to do manuel Laber for a liveing In view of the foregoing facts we insist that his case is one that commends Itself with much force to your Executive Clemency -- He cannot pay the fine and a failure on your part to interfere in his behalf<pb/>
<lb/>will as surely imprison him -- Which will do the commonwealth no good and will be very humiliating to said Gamble -- We do not Petition your Excellency for any other person than that simple Justice may be done a poor honest ignorant man we therefore insist that your Excelly may be inclined to favor an ardent friend -- and zealous supporter of his Country in all and every respect -- and one too who would never have outraged the Law purposely -- as an earnest of the foregoing we set our hands hereto</p>
