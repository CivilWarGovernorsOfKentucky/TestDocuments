<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>John Wesbrook was fined in two instances in our court for gaming. He is not an habitual gambler, &amp; one of the fines &amp; its costs has been paid</p>
<p>Wesbrook is now in the Southern Army under Humphrey Marshall &amp; as his <hi rend="underline">security</hi> the sherif <hi rend="underline">now</hi> calls upon <hi rend="underline">me</hi> to pay his fine, the fine is $ 20 &amp; its costs addup make me pay nearly $40. to liquidate it,</p>
<p>Will you please do me the favor of remitting such portion of the fine as is under your control,</p>
<p>Money is very scarce, &amp; Lincoln<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> taxes, like a dark cloud threatening great destruction, is looming up before us all, but a power may yet arise to which we can successfully appeal to have that remitted also.</p>
<p>The rebel feeling in this county is kept partially supressed by the ^military^ power stationed here, but like a camomile bed <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> it seems to grow &amp; strengthen &amp; intensify the more it is trampled upon</p>
<p>It has in its ranks in this county a large proportion of firm, bold &amp; determined men, &amp; the abolition policy of Congress &amp; the administration is adding much to their strength</p>
<p>Hoping you will promptly grant the small favor asked of you I am with much respect very truly yours. </p>
