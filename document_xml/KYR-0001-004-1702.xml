<p>The undersigned petitions the Gov to remit so much of a fine which was assessed against of $20 assessed in <date when="1860">1860</date> costs $9.30 cts in Franklin Circuit court for selling a drink of liquor -- His case has been respited from time to time according to the record until now the shff is pressing him for it -- at the last election he was litterally eat out of every thing by the Federal Soldiers who were sent down to Bald Knob, ^and all his good clothes taken by them^ and he is now in consequence of the times unable to pay the fine without distressing his family</p>
<p>The officers are Kind enough to promise to release their costs -- He has never sold a dram since &amp; never will</p>
<p>Resply
<lb/>John Brewer</p>
<p>Jno Brewer we know &amp; believe it would be right to remit the fine -- He is ^a^ hard working man of weak mind -- But sober &amp; disposed to do right -- We believe it would be charity to his family to let him off we have not heard of his ever having violated the law but the once &amp; dont believe he will do so again<pb/></p>
