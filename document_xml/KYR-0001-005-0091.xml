  <body>
   <p>To his Excellency, the Govenor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>The undersigned would respectfully represent, that they are citizens of Caldwell County, Kentucky, that they now are, and for several years now last past, they have been well acquainted with Mr Edward Baker of the town of Princeton in said County that we know him to be a quiet, peaceable, moral and law abiding man, that in the early part of the late war, he entered the military service of the United States, and continued in it, until he was severely and dangerously wounded ^5 times^ in battle, that he has suffered much pecuniary loss, at the hands of Confederate soldiers and guerillas, that he now has but little property, that a few months ago, he furnished a stock for and employed a man to keep a saloon in said town, and put in said saloon a small table commonly called a Jenny Lind table, upon which games of skill were played for amusement, the loser paying a few cents for the use of the table, and sometimes for cigars and liquor for those engaged in playing.</p>
<p>We are informed and as we believe truly that gaming upon said table and in said saloon was strictly forbidden, and we are confident that it was not carried on upon said table or in said Saloon with the knowledge of the said Baker or with his consent, and we are confident that he was guilty of no known violation of law. Yet he has been indicted for setting up said table for permitting gaming upon it, and for permitting gaming in said saloon. Now we think said indictments unjust and oppressive, and we therefore ask that the supposed offenses for which they were found may be pardoned.</p>

<lb/>To the Governor.</p>
<p>We have known Mr Baker the bearer of this <unclear/> for several years past. He is and always has been one of the truest men in Southern Ky and has suffered as much for his devotion to the county as any man of our acquaintance. He is now a cripple, yet suffering from the many wounds he received in battle. He has also sustained heavy losses in property when the rebels made raids into our section of Ky. We hope you will deem it proper and consistent with the public <unclear>interest</unclear> to pardon M<hi rend="sup">r </hi>Baker</p>
