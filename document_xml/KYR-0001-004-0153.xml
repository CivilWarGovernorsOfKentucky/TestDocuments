<lb/>Dear Friend</p>
<p>Once more I will have to call upon you to do me a favor. My brother in Law Levi S Baker was at the <date when="--10">October Term</date> of our court fined fifty dollars for carrying a pistol. Now I want you to hand to the Gov of Kentucky the within petition to have the fine remitted. If you are on good terms with the Governor, I would like for you to make a representation of facts for me. The circumstances in the case were about these, a man by the name of Abbott liveing close to Baker had fallen out with all the family of Baker and <hi rend="str">said</hi> ^used^ some slanderous language in reference to Bakers mother. Baker determined to make him take it Back or thrash him, he was told that he had better prepare himself before he said anything to Abbott. He saw Abbott passing through his Baker,s field. and asked him about it, and Abbott drew a hatchet and Baker shot at him but missed ^him^ and Abbott run. The parties who signed his petition know all about the facts in the case and fully Justify him. he was tried and acquitted for the shooting. he is poor and unable to pay the fine without a sacrifice. Now if you can conscienciously do any thing for him you will confer a favor on your old friend. My family are all well. Mr Samuels I am sorry to say is being verry low. I am afraid will not live but a short time. no news here</p>
<p>Your friend A J Bartlett<pb/></p>
