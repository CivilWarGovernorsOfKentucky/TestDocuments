   <p>Carlisle, <date when="1861-08-28">Aug. 28. 1861.</date>
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>James H. Orr, Esq. of this County has recently joined the Confederate army, and is no longer a citizen of this County -- Consequently, his office of Justice of the peace of Nicholas County, is vacated -- He has also requested me to tender you his resignation, for him, which I now do -- </p>
<p>The neighbors of 'Squire Orr desire that his borther, Oscar F. Orr, be appointed in his place, and I have no doubt he is the Choice of the district -- and they have requested me to recommend him to you -- Mr. Orr is a gentleman of good Sense, well qualified for the office, and I hope you -- will appoint, and that you will do so at an early day, as he will be needed at our approaching -- Court of Claims.</p>
<p>Very respectfully
<lb/>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. Nowell, as Judge of the Nicholas County Court.</p>
<p>Gov. MaGoffin.<pb/></p>
<p>Nicholas Co
