   <p>Hon Thos. E. Bramblette
<lb/>Gov. of Ky -- </p>
<p>The undersigned your petitioners citizens of Caroll County would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1865-03">March term 1865</date> of the Carroll Circuit court Cassius Claxon was fined $20 and costs for gaming on premises without consent of the occupants -- Judgement was taken by default. At the <date when="1864-08">August term 1864</date> while this indictment against Claxon was pending, All the indictments were stolen from the court most of the were subsequently returned -- Claxon hearing that the indictments had been taken believed his case was ended, and paid no further attention to the matter. Petitioners further state that two other persons were indicted for playing with Claxon being in the same game. They defended and were acquitted, the gaming having been proved to be with the Knowledge and consent of the occupant. Believing it would be unjust for Claxon to be punished<pb/>
<lb/>when he could have established his innonce if he had thought the case pending we respectfully request your excellency to remit said fine</p>
<p>Cassius Claxon</p>
