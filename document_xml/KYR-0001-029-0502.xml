   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/> Governor of . -- <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">James F. Robinson</persName><orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName></p>
<p>The undersigned Citizens of  would make an appeal to your Excellency on behalf of the <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">Louisville Kentucky</placeName> &amp; family for the Pardon of  who is now &amp; has been for Four years past confined in the , being convicted and sentenced for Ten years in the  on the charge of an attempt to commit a Rape on his Step Daughter <persName ref="cwgk:N00003073">wife</persName><persName ref="cwgk:N00003072">Frederick Yanner</persName><orgName ref="cwgk:O00000266">Penetentiary of Kentucky</orgName><orgName ref="cwgk:O001000">Jefferson Circuit Court</orgName> then under Fourteen years of age, Yanner had been for several years previous to this charge addicted to habits of very great Intemperance in drinking and had become so much reduced &amp; his Physical Energies so much destroyed as to render it very Improbable that he would attempt to commit such an offense &amp; particularly on a child under his care and protection. On the night the offence is charged to have been committed the Mother of Anna left her and Yanner at the house. He being beastly Intoxicated &amp; lying on the floor and Anna &amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N00003074">Anna Smith</persName> on the bed &amp; asleep. And on the return of the Mother, Yanners ; Anna made the charge &amp; he was arrested tried &amp; convicted Anna being the principal &amp; only witness, some proof was made that the child had marks of violence on her person, Indicating that such an attempt had been made, but whether by Yanner or some one who came into the<persName ref="cwgk:N00003075">a younger sister</persName><persName ref="cwgk:N00003073">wife</persName><pb/>
<lb/>house in the Mothers absence &amp; while Yanner lay drunken &amp; helpless on the floor is matter of doubt, The child was asleep &amp; in her alarm at the attempt made &amp; the drunken step father being aroused by her cries, she may have supposed the wrong was done by him while the Guilty party Escaped in the Darkness. Yanners  has by her Labor supported herself &amp; two Daughters since his Imprisonment she is now in feeble health &amp; we think it would be right &amp; proper under the circumstances that he should be released. We hope his Long confinement has destroyed the appetite for strong drink &amp; that he will hereafter by his Labor aid in the support of his family -- <persName ref="cwgk:N00003073">wife</persName></p>

<p>Upon a further examination of this case some additional details and upon full conversation and corroboration with Capt  taking into consideration the past comportment of Frederick Yanner and paralized &amp; hopeless physical condition I have concluded that policy <persName ref="cwgk:N00003088">Todd</persName><unclear/> and probably <unclear/> will be <unclear/> by <unclear/> pardon and do herefore grant him a pardon as prayed for</p>
