<lb/>Govenor,</p>
<p>Theodore Krysher who will hand you this was indicted with eleven others at the Fayette Term of my (Fayette) Court for dealing Faro. Krysher with, Webster, Warnock, <unclear/>, Loyd, Konkle, Edwards, &amp; Charley Craig confessed Judgt for $500 each &amp;- Bill White, John Payne, Will Owens, and George Ashlock gave Bond and did not confess. What I write for more particularly is to say, that Theodore Krysher is not a regular Faro dealer. I find upon enquiry that the proof before the grand Jury, was, that he dealt once what is called a <hi rend="underline">snap</hi>. that is by the permission of the owner of a table, he had a sight deal. I do believe this is his whole connection with Faro, and I am satisfied that he is not a gambler, or I would not write for him. You know Govenor that I do not write often, and I assure you that I will only do so, in cases that I think merits your interposition if you can help Krysher you will much oblige</p>
<p>yours Respectfully
