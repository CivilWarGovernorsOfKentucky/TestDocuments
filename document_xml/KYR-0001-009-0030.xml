<p>2D. That we consider his Proclamation of <date when="1863-01-01">January first, 1863</date>, as the potent instrument, which in the hands of Providence, will assuredly effect the regeneration of the Republic and secure its re-establishment on the solid basis of Universal Freedom, and that his proclamation of <date when="1863-12-08">December 8th, 1863</date>, having in view the re-organization of the Rebellious States, entitles him to the lasting gratitude of every lover of State Government and impartial liberty.</p>
<p>3D. That we hereby declare Abraham Lincoln to be our choice for next President, and Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, for Vice President; and we propose, that they be made the candidtes by general acclamation, without the formality of a National Convention, believing that the people of Kansas and the Union will rally to their support with a unanimity unparalleled since the foundation of the Government.</p>
<p>4TH. That the Governor be, and he is hereby requested, to forward a copy of these Resolutions to the President of the United States, to each of our Senators and Representatives in Congress, and to the Governors of the several States.</p>
