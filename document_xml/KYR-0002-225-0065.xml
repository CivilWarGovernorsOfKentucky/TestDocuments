<lb/>My Dear Sir</p>
<p>I held the August term of the Clinton Circuit Court last week, and at the instance of some of the officers in that county I will make a Suggestion or two in relation to Matters in that locality -- There are now in Clinton Near 200 soldiers, a large part of them are not necessary and indeed would be of little service any way -- If they were all Mustered out except about 25 picked Men and they put under the control of the sheriff I think Matters would be much better than at present. The people of that noble little<pb/>
<lb/>County are struggling to reinstall themselves &amp; reestablish law &amp; order but as you Know they are on the confines of a bad population in Fintress &amp; Overton and need protection &amp; assistance -- <hi rend="underline">There is a set of scoundrels on the line that are increasing in number &amp; must be <unclear>formindable</unclear> to all law &amp; order if permitted</hi> to remain there -- all the Jail Breakers &amp; Other refugees from Justice go there for protection &amp; to depredate in good citizens -- you &amp; Gov. Brownlow will have to disperse &amp; capture this set of outlaws -- </p>
<p>No News. -- heavy Docket here
<lb/>Yours Truly
<lb/>T T Alexander</p>
<p>you can get particulars, by writing to the shff &amp; clerk Clinton -- </p>
