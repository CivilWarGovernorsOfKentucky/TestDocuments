<lb/>Dr Sir</p>
<p>Last week my nephew George F.

Your compliance will oblige Your friend,</p>

<p>Will do you me the kindness to present the enclosed to his Excll Gov Magoffin. You will see from it, that I have violated <hi rend="str">the peace &amp; dignity</hi> <hi rend="str">of</hi> an ordinance of my goodly village, which I need hardly assure you was unintentional, My nephew G F. Whitehead was <unclear/> in the matter we will be <unclear/> $9<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> ^costs^ exclusive of the fine of $3<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> each. It is a small matter, but $6<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> is now as much as $20. was 6 months since. Your attention will oblige.</p>
