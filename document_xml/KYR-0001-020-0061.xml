<p>Dr. J. H. Calvert says that he has long been acquainted with Thomas B. Wadlington and with his general moral character. He says said Wadlington has always been regarded as a peacable and law abiding citizen. He states that he is also acquainted with the deceased Milton A. Cartwright, and he considers him a man of violent and dangerous character, and such he thinks is the general opinion of his neighbors. </p>
<p>He states, that from all the facts and circumstances, connected with the whole transaction of the Killing, he does verily believe, that the facts in regard to the Killing, was not truly stated to the Jury, and such he believes to be the general opinion of the community at this time. He believes that manifest injustice has been done by the verdict of the Jury and he is of the opinion, that he ought to be discharged. </p>
