<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Gov. Bramlette
</persName><lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I suppose one of the greatest annoyances, incident to your office as Govinor, is an application to pardon those condemned as ciminals -- doubtless, efforts are often made to rescue those that ought to suffer -- but, I think you know me well enough, to be satisfied that I would not try to prevent the punishment of the guilty -- or of those I believe to be guilty.</p>
<p>An unfortunate negro girl, about 21 or 22 years of age, brought to this city, as a contraband, by <persName ref="cwgk:N002042">Buell's</persName> <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000748">Army</orgName>, last Fall, <persName ref="cwgk:N002001">Caroline</persName>, by name, has been<pb/>
<lb/>tried, convicted and sentenced to be hung upon the <date when="---11">11th</date> Ins<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. If guilty she ought certainly to receive the dreadful penalty But, in my judgment, it is very doubtful, to say the least, whether she perpetrated the deed. I did not hear the evidence before the jury -- but had a statement of the evidence, in person, from the <persName ref="cwgk:N002003">Judge </persName>and <persName ref="cwgk:N002002">Commonwealth's Attorney</persName>, and do not think the life of any human being ought to be taken, from such testimony. No one cared any thing about her, and she had a strong prejudice to meet in the mere fact of being a contraband. I visited her as a spiritual instructer and at first inquired into the facts of the case solely as a guide in bringing her to confession and repentance -- when I rec<hi rend="sup">d</hi> the statement, I was amazed that any one<pb/>
<lb/>should have been convicted upon such a showing. I do not charge or believe there was any corruption in the Court. I questioned and crossquestioned ^<persName ref="cwgk:N002001">Caroline</persName>^ at different times, and in every way my ingenuity would dictate, and always received the same simple, artless narative. I may be mistaken <hi rend="str">in</hi> but I do not believe any one, as ignorant as she is, could tell me such a lie as she did, if guilty, and not be caught. She gives a very natural account of every part of the case, that looked to her guilt. I pressed upon her conscience with all the power I could, the impossibility of her finding pardon of God, if she went to Him with a lie in her mouth -- and that she might find pardon from God for murder telling lies and every other sin, if she would confess and repent -- <pb/>
<lb/>And this I continued up to the very time she expected to be taken out for execution. She was sentenced to be hung, last month, and we got <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Gov. Robinson</persName> to extend her time -- She knew nothing of the extention of the time, or even that application had been made for any thing.</p>
<p>More than this, Caroline gives many marks of true penitence for sin -- in a word, she gives good evidence of genuine conversion, and yet denies resolutely that she perpetrated the deed.</p>
<p>No body claims that any of her anticedents point to such a deed, but the contrary is proven by the parents of the child that was poisoned.</p>
<p>In my judgment, no man that will use poison about his premises as carelessly as <persName ref="cwgk:N00000995">Mr Levi</persName> did, has any right to ask that this servant shall be hung upon ^such^ circumstantial evidence, if <persName ref="cwgk:N002006">his child</persName> should die of poison.</p>
<p>I did not intend to test your patience so long, but it is no light matter to take the life of even a friendless and homeless contraband. I hope you will look into the case, and not let the heavy arm of power fall upon an innocent being.</p>
<p>Yours very respectfully
<lb/>John L. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Kee</p>
