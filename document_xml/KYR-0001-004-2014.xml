<lb/>Gov. Tho E. Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort.
<lb/>Dear Gov.</p>
<p>This will introduce M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Cary Cox who visits Frankfort to See his son in the Penitentiary and to Consult with you in regard to his case, M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Cox (the elder) has behaved prudently &amp; discreetly in relation to the prosecution against his son from first to last so far as I know or believe, and whilst he has, of course, manifested a great degree of feeling and interest for his son, has done nothing so far as I have observed unbecoming a Gentleman.</p>
<p>I have been forcibly struck from the outset &amp; during the whole prosecution &amp; trial with the manly bearing &amp; deportment of his son Milton B Cox, from his age, appearance &amp; general good deportment I am led to believe that this young man was led into evil company &amp; thence into violations of law by <hi rend="underline">older &amp; more vicious &amp; corrupt individuals</hi> -- I therefore feel free to ask your Excellency to confer with him &amp; satisfy yourself on these points and the additional point as to <hi rend="underline">who are the Most guilty</hi><pb/>
<lb/>and if a full investigation can be had and -- the wost &amp; most guilty punished. I think that Executive Clemency should be shown towards young Cox. -- I have assured M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Cox (the Elder) that you would deal justlly &amp; mercifully with his Son if put in possession of <hi rend="underline">all the facts</hi> <hi rend="underline">in the</hi> case.</p>
<p>Very Respt
<lb/>Your obt Servant &amp; friend
<lb/><hi rend="underline">T T Alexander</hi></p>
