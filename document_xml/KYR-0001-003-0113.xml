<lb/>Thomas E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I have the honor herewith to enclose a letter from Brig Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Brisbin. From which you will see that he can only re-enroll Ten of the Twenty Regiments of Colored Troops organized in the State of Kentucky The re-enrollment of the other Ten Regiments organized in Kentucky is, I think important but not as much so as that of Regiments organized in other States with Slaves from Kentucky, Such Regiments have not kept a record as to the former owner or any other record by which the Slave can be identified. While in Kentucky there was a partial record made as to who the former Owner was. In my letter to you of the <date when="1865-06-28">28<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> June</date> I had hoped to be able to carry out the re-enrollment but for want of means to defray travelling expenses I find I cannot but hope you will take such steps as will secure a record in the Adjutant General Office as to enable Owners to identify their Slaves </p>
<p>Respectfully Your Most Ob<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Servant.
<lb/>Ja<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> P. Flint
<lb/>Agent</p>
