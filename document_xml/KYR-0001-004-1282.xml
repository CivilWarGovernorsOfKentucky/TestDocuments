<p>I was acting as atty for the commonwealth when Kate Allen was tried &amp; in view of the fact that she was intoxicated when she took the watch, and has two small children dependant upon her for support, I concur in <hi rend="str">the</hi> recommending her to the clemency of the Executive</p>
<p>J G Carlisle</p>
<p>I heard the evidence in the above case &amp; felt satisfied that the woman did not take the watch with any intention of appropriating it to her own use, Almost as soon as she got it she showed it to people on the street saying look here I have got John Youngers watch, and spoke of it all the while as John Younger's watch and not as her own, She was intoxicated &amp; did not understand what she was about.</p>
