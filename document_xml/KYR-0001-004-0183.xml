   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Governor Bramlette:</p>
<p>D. B. Price states that he is a citizen of Woodford County, living near the town of Midway. He was by the Judgment of the Woodford Circuit Court on the <date when="1863-10-05">5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of October 1863</date> fined Seventy dollars on the charge of dealing with Lewis, the slave of R. H. Davenport. The alleged trading consisted in the purchase of three bushels of hemp seed which were proven, upon the trial, to be worth five dollars per bushel. Petitioner purchased the seed of the negro, but did not suppose at the time that he was doing wrong, as the negro had been in the habit of trading in produce and other articles. He had been allowed from time to time to buy poultry to ship to Louisville and other points, and so much confidence was reposed in his integrity that persons in the neighborhood, including reputable citizens, often Times credited him until he got his return of sales. The negro sustained with all in the neighborhood an excellent character. The hemp seed were brought by him to Midway <hi rend="str">about</hi> in day light during business<pb/>
<lb/>hours and purchased by petitioner about 11 oclk A.M. in public, and without any concealment. One of the most respectable citizens of Woodford, and a wealthy farmer, tried to buy the same seed, but failed because petitioner had purchased them. The seed were delivered soon after the purchase, in his store.</p>
<p>He presents with the petition the names of sundry citizens of Woodford County, the most of whom are farmers, and all reputable citizens, including R H Davenport the owner of the Slave and Major Chas H Buford and W R Buford the sons of W. S. Buford who as a member of the Grand Jury preferred the charge upon which the indictment was found. <hi rend="str">The absence of W S Buford.</hi> These persons all know the slave. Some of them are trustees of Midway and one a justice of the peace. The hemp seed were paid for in money.</p>
<p>D. B. Price</p>
<p>Thomas Jones states that the statements of the foregoing petition of D B Price in regard to the purchase of the hemp seed are to his knowledge true. The purchase<pb/>
<lb/>was made as there stated in public. He states also that said slave had been in the habit of trafficking in produce and other things, and that said slave had always sustained a good character for honesty. The said D B Price is a man of good character and a man of limited means, and so far as affiant knows and believes a law abiding citizen. <hi rend="str">and has</hi></p>
