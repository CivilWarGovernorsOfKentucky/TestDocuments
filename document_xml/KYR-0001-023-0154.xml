<lb/>Hon. W. P. Fowler
<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>I am informed that many of the officers of your court in different counties are Secessionists, and have not taken the oath of allegiance; that they are constantly oppressing Union men and talking treason in the very presence of the court. These things should not be. The Union army came here to sustain and defend the Constitution of the United States, to protect Union men and punish treason wherever it may be found, whether in high or low places; So far as I myself am concerned I shall try to do so. I understand that Capt Duvall has been indicted and imprisoned for being in Some way concerned in arresting traitors. If that be so he must be at once released. When I took command of this post, I was instructed that no officer would be permitted to act in any official capacity whatever, who did not take the oath to support the constitution of the United States and of the State of Kentucky. That rule has been<pb/>
<lb/>strictly adhered to in this County and must be in all Counties where I have the authority to enforce it. I hope you will see that where you hold court it is done; all jurrors both grand &amp; petit should take the oath before being empannelled. I want a record of such oath sent to these Head Quarters.</p>
<p>Respectfullly Yours
<lb/>(signed) S. Noble
