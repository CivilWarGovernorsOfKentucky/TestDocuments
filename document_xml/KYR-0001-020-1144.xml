<p>He says that a short time Since his License Expired and that a few days intervened between the Expiration and renewal of the Same,</p>
<p>He says that the delay in taking out his License has been occasioned by the fact that it is almost impossible to collect money in said City, and not with a view to Cheat the City out of any of her revenues, that he is a law abiding Citizen and always will conform to the laws of his Country -- </p>
<p>He says he is poor and did not neglect to renew his License intentionally but because he could not help himself and in view of all the facts of the Case he trust your Excellency will remit Said fine</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
