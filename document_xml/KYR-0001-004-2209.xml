   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Gov. Thomas E. Bramblette</p>
<p>The Undersigned Citizens and residents of the County of Bath, would respectfully Represent, That at the <date when="1858-03">March, Term 1858</date>, of the Bath Circuit Court a fine of $20, and costs was recovered by the Commonwealth against Ephraim Gooden. Also at the <date when="1858-09">September Term 1858</date>, of the same Court another fine of $60, was made against him for keeping a Tipling House and retailing with out license, each of which fines were recovered without defense being made to the indictments.</p>
<p>We would further represent That said Gooden is a peaceable loyal and law abiding citizen, That he is a poor man in bad health; and that now if he had those fines remitted would be able to make something for the support, of his family. We do think this one a case in which the exercise of your clemency would be right and Just to all --
