<lb/>Sir:</p>
<p>My nephew Geo. D. Boldrick desires the position of Capt C. S. of U.S. Vols; and from the recommendation he has from his employer (Capt J. F. Huber, C. S.) and from the fact that he has been in the Department for nearly three years, I feel safe in saying that he is thoroughly acquainted with the business pertaining to that office. He is eminently loyal and strictly moral. If consistent with your feelings, I request that you give him a letter of recommendation to the President or what ever document you may think best, and which you will please forward to me. Anything you may do for him will ^be^ gratefully acknowledged by</p>
<p>Your friend,
<lb/>G W Doneghy</p>
<p>To
<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>T. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Gov. of Ky</p>
