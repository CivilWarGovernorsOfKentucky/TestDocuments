<p>Sir, your letter of <date when="1864-09-03">sept 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi></date> was recved stating that affidavits sent to the Govr asking the remission of a fine against John Branstetter had never been received, &amp; also that you had answered my letter of <date when="1864-08-03">aug 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi></date> I receved no answer until yours of <date when="1864-09-03">sept 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi></date> the affidavits were sent in <date when="1864-06">June</date> &amp; am sorry they were lost &amp; the men who made the affidavits were the neighbors of Branstatter &amp; live in a remote part of the county so that I do not know when I can see them again -- </p>
<p>I send in the stead thereof a Petition or statement from under the hands of the Commonwealth Atty, the Two Clerks &amp; Sheriff of our county &amp; myself -- </p>
<p>Say to the Govenor that this is the second pet- that I ever signed for the release of a man from a fine imposed by a court of Justice though many have been presented to me -- I sign this because I conscientiously believe that the case is one of the very few which demands the interposition of the Govenor,</p>
<p>yours &amp;c
<lb/>R B Doheney</p>
<p>You say in your letter that I wrote to W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Bramlette something in regard to one John Shive if I did, it was a mistake in the names there is only one case &amp; that is John Branstatter</p>
