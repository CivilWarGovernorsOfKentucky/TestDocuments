   <p>Memphis, <date when="1865-09-02">Sept. 2nd, 1865</date>.
<lb/>E. L. Van Winkle, Esqr.
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I took the Amnesty oath under President Johnson's Proclamation &amp; was thereby pardoned not being included in any class of the Exceptions. I have understood that Atty. Genl Speed has decided that the pardon from the President does not acquit from State charges.</p>
<p>I have taken the amnesty in good faith &amp; mean to abide by it. I was a citizen of Tenn. at &amp; during the war, and am now. I only went into Ky. together with the hosts of others under the order of commanding Confederate Generals -- &amp; every act done there was as a regular soldier in discharge of a soldiers orders and duties -- I do not wish any further annoyance -- and will ask that you use your influence with the Gov. to extend to me for the state what President Johnson has for the U. S.</p>
<p>When I go up to Ky. to see my friends<pb/>
<lb/>I want to go as a gentleman free from all petty annoyances -- </p>
<p>Respectfully,
<lb/><hi rend="underline">H. C. King</hi></p>
  </body>
