<p>Respectfully submitted to the Sec<hi rend="sup">ty</hi> of War, in connection with the letter of J. R. Dupuy Esq<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Commonwealth's Attorney. This letter together with those of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pittinger &amp; M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. Buffum furnishes the only information I have been enabled to obtain, in reference to the offence of late Lieut Buffum notwithstanding the emphatic assertion of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Dupuy that there were no mitigating circumstances in the case, it is at least possible if not probable that as urged by his wife &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pittinger the crime was committed while the Prisoner was under the influence of liquor That a soldier capabale of such patriotic daring as he had previously
<lb/><cb n="3"/>displayed, should with a sword at his side &amp; a commission in his pocket, be capable while in his senses of so petty a theft as this, can scarcely be believed Lt Buffum, while a private soldier, as a member of the expedition organized by Gen Mitchell for cutting the eney's communications, rendered most important services to the government, and rendered them under cirucmstances of extreme peril &amp; prolonged suffering For this he received a medal of honor from the Sercretary of War &amp; a Commission from the Governor of Ohio. His release from his present humiliating confinement<milestone unit="column" n="2"/><pb/>
<lb/><cb n="1"/>would seem to be but a just appreciation of these services. It is therefore recommended that upon this ground the Governor of Kentucky be requested to pardon him.</p>
