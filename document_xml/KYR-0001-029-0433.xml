   <p>To His Excellency James F Robinson Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Grant County would respectfully represent to your excellency that at the present term of the Grant circuit Court J D Hutcherson was fined $147 -- upon an indictment for stealing the horse of one Jay Kinslaer -- the Jury found him not guilty of the felony but found him guilty of a trespass to which he plead guilty -- the evidence was that he took the horse of Kinslaer at night to get out of the way of some soldiers that he feared would arrest him -- that he went to the residence of A Morris a mile from Kinslaers in the road to New Liberty where he was going -- <pb/>
<lb/>called up Morris, told him he had Kinslaers horse &amp; requested him to go the next day &amp; tell his Hutchersons wife where he was gone -- She was at <unclear/> in sight of Kinslaers -- From there he went to the residence of one T J M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Ginnis in the <unclear/> road a mile &amp; a half from Kinslaers called him up &amp; told him he had Kinslaers horse &amp; requested him to go to Kinslaers the next day &amp; tell Kinslaer he had his horse &amp; would send it home -- He was <unclear/> by one of Kinslaers band the same night &amp; gave up the horse &amp; the horse was returned to Kinslaer the same night -- He is a very poor man -- We think the fine extravegant<pb/>
<lb/>&amp; cruel -- We therefore most respectfully ask that your Excellency remit so much of said fine as you have the constitutional power to remit -- Williamstown</p>
