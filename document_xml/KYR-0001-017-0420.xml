<lb/>Hon. B. Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Mail Communication has just been established at this point or I would have written you sooner. Whilst ^I was^ at Frankfort you Commissioned Richard T. Higgins a Justice of the Peace in the Russellville District, Logan County, to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of A. Hull Esqr. Mr. Higgins has not qualified and does not desire to do so if you will appoint Felix H. Inman to the position. On reaching home I understood a petition had been gotten up to have D. W. Poor appointed -- this I understand was done because it was difficult to get any one under the then existing circumstances to agree to take the office -- Poor con<pb/>
<lb/>senting but as I understand really not desiring it. Mr. Inman whom I now recommend and whom I hope you will appoint, is well qualified for the position and desires it His appointment will give general satisfaction and I hope you will be so obliging as to make it.</p>
<p>your message prepared for the Legislature at its recent sitting in February has met the approbation of this community -- it has been sought and read with avidety and no one whom I have heard speak of it but passed high eluogy on you and it.</p>
<p>Your friends &amp; relatives all well Remember Kindly to the Hon. Secretary of State &amp; his assistant. and believe me to be</p>
<p>Sincerely &amp; truly
<lb/>your friend
<lb/>A. G. Rhea<figure type="hr"/></p>
