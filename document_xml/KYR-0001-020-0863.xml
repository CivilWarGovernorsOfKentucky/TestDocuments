<p>A Judgment was rendered on a forfeited recognizance of Isaac Rosenbaum in the Jeff Circuit Court in which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. S N Hodges was surity. The Judgment was entered on the <date when="1861-01-16">16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Jany 1861</date> for $600.</p>
<p>Mr Hodges settled with the atto for the Commths atto: his portion of the Judgment as I learn and of which I have no doubt. Mr H recd: nothing for himself except a fee for defending Rosenbaum. After Rosenbaum ran off and there by forfeited his recognizance, Mr Hodges found out his wherabouts and went to Indiana<pb/>
<lb/>at his own expense and brought Rosenbaum ^to the city^ and surrendered him into custody.</p>
<p>I hope you will release Mr Hodges from the payment of the aMount for which he is bound on the Recognizance. The Commth has not been injured by the forfeiture of the recognizance</p>
