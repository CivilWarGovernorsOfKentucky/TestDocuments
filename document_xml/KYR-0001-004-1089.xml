<lb/>Governor of Ky.

<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Simpson County would respectfully represent that <hi rend="str">GW</hi> Gooden Smith a citiz of this county was at the <date when="1864-05">May Term 1864</date> ^of the Butler Circuit Court^ Sentenced to confinement in the Penatentiary for a term of two years. for seducing a slave from her master, in this county. We would further state that his mother is a widow woman. quite <hi rend="underline">old</hi> and a <hi rend="underline">crippl</hi>. She is verry poor &amp; entirely dependent upon her children for a support. and has but one other child that is single. we would further state that prior to this charge young Smith stood fair among his neighbors. &amp; all others who knew him. &amp; we are inclined to the belief that impressions were made upon his mind that there was no Law in the state &amp; in consequence of this impression, acted in the premices. <hi rend="str">but not with the least fellonious purpose</hi> We would therefore pray that you extend to him all the Executive clemency pratcicable in the premices &amp; that you pardon him of said offese. We ask this, not so much for the said Smith, as for his old. feeble &amp; decrepid mother. In humanity we pray.</p>

He is truly loyal, &amp; served twelve months in the 1<hi rend="str">4</hi>8th Ky. Regiment. Given under my hand this <date when="1864-08-20">Aug 20th. 1864.</date></p>

<p>I have been acquainted with Gooden Smith for Several years and previous to the charge against upon which he is now confined in the penetintiary. I know that his reputation was fair in this community as an honorable man His mother is a widow in poor circumstances. and depends on her children for a support. For a short time before he went off with the negro, he resided, with and worked for a man who was disloyal and I regard it as very probable that he was induced to believe that the laws could not be enforced. It is said that his imployer endeavored to induce him to Join the wing of the rebel army commanded by Morgan. The negro belonged to his rebel employer. I should remark that whatever inducements may have been held out to him to Join Morgans Command. they were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>I knew the young man Gooden Smith some few years ago -- His mother was my tenant &amp; he resided with her -- They resided in Simpson County -- I know him to be an industrious young man and heard no charge of dishonesty against ^him^ until the affair about the negro. I unite in the petition for his release</p>

<p>I know nothing of the facts, or any of them stated in other of the petitions, except that Smith was connected and I know nearly all of the Gentlemen whose names are subscribed, to the petition, and I believe them to be respectable and truthful gentlemen</p>
