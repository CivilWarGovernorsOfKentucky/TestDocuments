<lb/>Gov Thos E. Bramlette</p>
<p>The principle in the within petition John Lampkins is a sober and good citizen of, Marion County -- It is not believed by his townsmen and friends that he permits gaming for money or anything of value in his house -- Lampkins resides at Raywick and in that section of the county infested by guerillas and where the Federal forces during many months could afford no protection -- He says (and I presume tis true) that during the reign of terror he was not able to Exercise any control or to maintain order about his house -- since the restoration of order &amp; Law he keeps an orderly house and does not permit gaming of any kind about his house. Lampkins is a loyal union man</p>
