   <p>To His Excellency Beriah Magoffin Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>We the undersigned, citizens of Caldwell County Ky, have long Known Thomas B. Wadlington and he has ever been considered a good &amp; true hearted citizen &amp; known &amp; noted for his industry &amp; peaceable &amp; orderly conduct The difficulty in which he was engaged with Milton A. Cartwright did not appear to us to be of his own seeking, nor are we satisfied nor do we believe that the case was fairly presented to the Jury, as it actually occurred </p>
<p>We hope your Excellency will review the case, and give the poor man the benefit of every doubt, and we desire that his case may be judged of in mercy, and regarded with favor, and that your Excellency will take into consideration every circumstance that ought to operate in his behalf. And we desire that your Excellency may be persuaded that it is consistent with your duty to extend to him Executive Clemency, and that his life may be spared, either by a full pardon or a commutation of his punishment -- </p>
<p><date when="1861-01-22">Jany 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 1861</date>.
<lb/>Yours respectfully<pb/>
