   <p>Louisville, <date when="1862-07-29">July 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1862</date>
<lb/>To his Excellency. Governor Magoffin, of Kentucky</p>
<p>Paul Garras, referred in petition, Started from Louisville, to New Haven Ky. about the <date when="1860-05-21">21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of may 1860,</date> to take possession of a saw &amp; grist Mill, belonging to W. Carden, located in Rolling-fork. When he began at S<hi rend="sup">d</hi> mill, he had about a Capital of $1800. he then employed, Erhard Duplain and Antony Julien (this latter, now deceased) J. Vander Espt was living at that time with Paul Garras, and remained with him until he left, which was towards the <date when="1861-04-18">18<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> or <date when="1861-04-20">20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of April 1861.</date> Regarding the intemacy S<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to be existing between he Paul Garras, and a certain colored girl Cirella, property of Jack Dawson of New Haven, I know, and it was known ^that^ She was washing for the inmates of the House, (Garras) that is abut two months, ^after^ he Garras, was in that locality Dawson, the master of the Girl knew it, that She was washing for him. The <date when="1860-12-21">21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of December 1860,</date> I married, and consequently, occupied a room in the house, where the girl Civilla, frequently called on Mrs. Vander Espt to learn how to make her own dresses. Towards the beginning of <date when="1861-04">April,</date> Erhard Duplain, <hi rend="str">a</hi> named above, made a trunk for me to pack up my books &amp;c, therefor, the idea, that is was made for the girl is false and erroneous, as I had it made for my own use, but being too Small, I, gave the trunk to the girl Civilla, Paul Garras, did not order the trunk for running her off as intimated by those who wished his ruin. The girl put her clothes at Mrs Hayes close by our residence, fearing that her Master, perhaps would not allow the Slave to keep the trunk.</p>
<p>Garras, funished lumber, and flour &amp;<hi rend="sup">c</hi> and to <hi rend="str">his</hi> Dawson his sons, amongst whom was William, who owed</p>
<p>(To Hon Beriah MaGoffin, Governor.)
<lb/>Frankfort Ky.<pb/></p>
<p>owed him a certain am<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of money Garras called several times for it, he intending to go South, at little Rock, Ark. This vexed Dawson's family and without any just cause, they accused him of attempting to run away the girl Civilla. After he had left New Haven, where afterwards returning, the furious mob, wished to hang him, as if he had been a Disciple of the John Brown the Abolitionist; that imputation to Garras was unjustly founded his intentions were not at all to run off the Slave either North or South, Having spent nearly all he possessed on the Mill he was compelled to look after earning his livelihood. He now, is in Memphis; previously to his trial in New Haven he had to undergo a severe vexation, and gave bail for his appearence his finding no employment in Louisville, he went to Nashville from Nashville, following the Southern army to Memphis, acting as Mill wright &amp;c. The case appearing in <date when="1860-12">December last</date> neither he Garras, nor principal witnesses could be got. Herrin Joseph his Security, could not do any thing in this case. The character of Garras is known to be good, as well as of the Security, the latter, in giving bail for his countryman done it with a pure motif of benevolence towards Garras, his case not being criminal; Herrin, acted the part of a humane man, although not knowing Garras particularly but in these trying times, he might have been exposed to ill treatments had he P. Garras remained in the prison of Bardstown. I have perhaps written too long a letter to your Excellency regarding what I know of the case concerning Garras, and Herrin, In Justice to both, I cannot but ^to^ say, that one and the other are good and peaceable citizens, and respectfully Submit to your Excellency what I know concerning this case. If my humble letter, can be accepted by our worthy Governor, in Justifying both of the party referred in, I will as ever, remain grateful, and Subscribe myself, most Respectfully &amp; Sincerely;</p>

<p>To his Excellency, Hon. Beriah MaGoffin,
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth, of Kentucky</p>
