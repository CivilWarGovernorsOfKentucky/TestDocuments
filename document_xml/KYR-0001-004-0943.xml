   <p>Metcalfe County <date when="1864-06-09">June 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1864</date>
<lb/>To his Excellency, Thomas E. Bramlette,
<lb/>Governor of the State of Kentucky.</p>
<p>The undersigned, your petitioner, would respectfully represent unto your Excellency, that at a called Term of the Metcalfe Circuit Court began &amp; held, the week ending Saturday the <date when="1864-06-04">4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of June 1864</date>, Joseph T. Whitlow, formerly a citizen of said County of Metcalfe, but now a citizen of Monroe County, was tried, in his absence &amp; without Counsel, upon an indictment charging him with Malicious assault on one Willis Wood, &amp; the Jury returned into Court a verdict of guilty against said Whitlow, &amp; assessed his fine to the Commonwealth at the sum of Fifty Dollars. Your petitioners state, that they are advised, &amp; believe, &amp; it was so established afterwards by proof in said Court in another case, wherein the said Whitlow was a party, that the said Whitlow was not informed of the Said Called term of the Metcalfe Circuit Court; that he had been previously arrested for said assault, upon a warrant issued by C. C. Haney, for the purpose, the said Haney being an acting Justice of the peace for Metcalfe County; that the said Whitlow was regularly tried, before said Haney, on said warrant, by a Jury of said County, &amp; verdict and Judgment rendered against him for Said assault, for the sum of fifteen dollars. Wherefore, petitioners pray your Excellency, to remit so much of said Whitlows fine, as your Excellency may have the power to ^do^ <hi rend="str">remit</hi>. &amp; as in duty bound &amp;c.</p>
