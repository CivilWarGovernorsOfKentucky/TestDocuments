<p>I respectfully address your Excellency, concerning the Security's of Paul Garras, both were known to me as well as by their Countrymen at large as respectable and peaceable Citizens. I would suggest to your Excellency, that the security in the person of Joseph Herin is also worthy of the benevolence of the public and the petition referred to, exhibits the cause of its solicitation. Not that this affair has anything to do of my competing it being altogether a Civil case, but, in this, I have taken the humble liberty, to address you a few lines in behalf of the solicitor, -- Knowing him for sixteen years past, I have always find him a human and good hearted man towards those who needed his assistance; his case to your Excellency, is void of deceit, and I would represent the applicant to you, as a man worthy of your Clemency, and the most worthy, represented therewith on petition subjoined, Of your Excellency,</p>
<p>Very Respectfully Sincere and obd<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Servant
