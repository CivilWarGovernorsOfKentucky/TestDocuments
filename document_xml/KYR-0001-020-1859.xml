   <p>To his Excellency, Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Magoffin </p>
<p>The undersigned were of the Jury who tried the case of the commonwealth against Jordan, in <date when="1854-03">March 1854</date>. We are satisfied that the punishment he has already undergone is an ample atonement for the offense of which we felt constrained by the evidence to find him guilty, and we do therefore heartily concur in the effort which we understand will be made to procure his pardon upon the terms and in the mode now provided by law. </p>
