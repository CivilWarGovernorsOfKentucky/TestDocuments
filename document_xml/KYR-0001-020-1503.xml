<p>William Gross states that he lives in Cloverport Kentucky and whilst Margolyes kept his tavern, he was employed by the coal &amp; oil company on there road and the said Tavern being on the immediate side of the road makes me well acquanited with said Margolyes and his tavern. I have Staid with Margolyes only 2 nights and eat there several times, I have seen corn fodder &amp; other food for horses &amp;c and I know he had a stable. I know also that the said Margolyes always tried to keep an orderly house and that always when I was there I was as well entertained as I wished to be or as well as could be at any country tavern Given under my hand the <date when="1861-11-22">22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> day of November 1861</date></p>
