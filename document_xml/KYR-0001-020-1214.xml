<p>My dear Governor,</p>
<p>Mr. Andrew G. Wilson, a most excellent citizen, and an upright law abiding man, had an old negro man, who took the liberty of going off and working for himself, and who from a rheumatic affection, was not perhaps restrained as much by his master as he should have been, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wilson for this was indicted and fined in the Mason Circuit Court 40$ for permitting him to go at large &amp;c, He asks you to remit so much of the fine as you can remit, and I concur with him in the application, I have send the remitted to me at this place,</p>
<p>Your friend
<lb/>R H Stanton</p>
<p>Hon B Magoffin
<lb/>Governor &amp;c</p>
<p><note place="left margin">Mr Wilson gave the court no trouble but confessed judgment, relying upon your clemency,</note><pb/></p>
<p>Remitted
