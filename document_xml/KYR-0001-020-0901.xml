<lb/>To His Excellency, B. Magoffin,
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>There will be a petition presented you, praying that the judgment of the Shebly circuit court vs. him be remitted. Mr. Washburn was reared &amp; has lived all his life where he now resides, and I have never Known him to be in Court before on any account, he is a harmless, inoffensive, peacable man, his Father was an old Virginian &amp; raised his sons under that regime. He accidentally had some neighbors at his house a drew his liquor in accordance with the former habits of the country and he unfortunately got too much aboard &amp; was rather noisey -- His Petition is signed by many of the most respectable men of the County -- &amp; I understand, by every neighbor he has, &amp; all of the witnesses in the case -- The Jury I suppose were something after the order of your old friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Henry upon the subject of Total abstenance -- Washburn is very much mortified &amp; diclares that a thing of the kind shall never again happen He is in very ordinary circumstances &amp; illy able to pay this expensive judgt.<pb/>
<lb/>It is under all the circumstances a very oppressive finding -- &amp; I sincerely think that the Attys. fee in the case &amp; the costs of the suit would be of itself a heavy penalty -- If agreeable to your sense of propriety remit the fine &amp; you will, were it necessary, be sustained by this community, &amp; render, particularly during these hard-times a lasting benefit &amp; obligation upon the Petetioner -- were I in your stead, I would not hesitate to remit the same</p>
<p>Yours very Respectfully
<lb/>J. M. Bullock<pb/></p>
