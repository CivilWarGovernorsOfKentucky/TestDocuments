Finlay in regard to my boy <hi rend="underline">Jo</hi> who stands condemned to hang at this place on the <date when="1864-08-26">26<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi></date> of the presant month I transmit this note and ask for his pardon whilst I would receive $400 if they boy hangs I do not believe him Guilty and would prefer loosing him Entirely rather than he should hang in my opinion for nothing</p>
<p>If the boy is pardoned he will Join the army and go out of this country I would not ask this but for my firm belief that the Boy is inicent he is 35 years old and has been one of the most dutiful humble quiet servants I Ever knew</p>

<p>Believing the laws should be enforced and if wrong repealed by the proper authority, no one should be exempted from the penalties except where there are circumstances of mitigation or intending to show, either a prejudiced verdict or one based upon insufficient or doubtful evidence of guilt. -- The Comths atty &amp; Judge who apply for mercy in behalf of the criminal say the evidence was sufficient to establish guilt. Such being the case -- no extenuation being offered -- the application for clemency is refused</p>
