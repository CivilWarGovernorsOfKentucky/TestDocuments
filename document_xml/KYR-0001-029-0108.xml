   <p>To His Excellency,
<lb/>The Governor of Kentucky:
<lb/>Dr Sir:</p>
<p>Having been the City Attorney for Louisville, Ky, from <date when="1855-04-16">April 16, 1855</date> till <date when="1861-04-16">April 16. 1861</date>, and during that time, having been prosecuting attorney in the Police Court, I have been applied to by old Mr<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Kramer, wife of Kauffman Kramer, to state to your Excellency what I know concerning her husband, who is now confined to the Penitentiary at Frankfort.</p>
<p>She desires me to do this, in consequence of her husband having applied to you to pardon him, and of your having been addressed by the Chief of Police of this City by letter in which he remonstrates against the pardon, stating in his letter (a copy of which she has shown me) that her husband is "a notorious old thief" -- "that he has been up before our Police Court often, charged with petit larceny, <hi rend="str">"</hi>and was once convicted and sent to the Work House."</p>
<p>Our Chief of Police, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stancliffe, is a very clever gentleman, &amp;; I am certain, does not make the statements as facts known to himself. In all probability he has reposed too much reliance in the statement of some Enemy of Kremers, &amp; has accordingly furnished you with his letter written on such information.</p>
<p>During the whole time I was in office as above stated, I have no recollection of Kauffman Kremer ever having been presented before the Police court or elsewhere on <hi rend="underline">any</hi> charge. But, not willing to make<pb/>
<lb/>a statement to your Excellency from my memory, which might be at fault, I have just returned from an Examination of the records of the Police Court.</p>
<p>I made a strict &amp; careful Examination, and <hi rend="str">only</hi> find that said Kauffman Kremer was never before said Police Court, Except as follows:</p>
<p>On the <date when="1854-08-28">28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Aug 1854</date>, he appeared before said Court and filed his declaration to become a Citizen of the United States; stating in his declaration that he landed in New Orleans in <date when="1841">1841</date> &amp; had resided about six years past in Louisville Ky.</p>
<p>The next time he appeared before the Police Court was on the <date when="1856-11-01">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Nov 1856</date>, when he appeared to obtain his Naturalization papers, and he was then naturalized.</p>
<p>The next time was on the <date when="1861-11-14">14 Nov 61</date> when he was charged with having stolen a goblet ^property of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> A. Craig^ worth less than $4.<hi rend="sup">00</hi> in value. I Examined the indictment &amp; find that he was found guilty &amp;, by the verdict of the Jury his imprisonment was fixed at one month in the Work House, yet the <hi rend="underline">Jury</hi> recommended him in their verdict to Executive Clemency; and they were probably induced to do this as there was, as I am informed, some proof tending to show that he had bought the goblet of a Negro, and Kremer could not introduce competent testimony in his defence.</p>
<p>The next &amp; only other time of Kramer being before the Police Court, was when his case was Examined on the charge for which he is now confined in the Penetentiary.</p>
<p>From my recollection of Matters while I was<pb/>
<lb/>prosecuting attorney &amp; from my Examination of the records of the Police Court, I can safely say and do say that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stancliffe is mistaken, when he says that Kremer has been up before the Police Court "<hi rend="underline">often</hi>" charged with petit larceny. He has never been before the Police Except at the times already herein stated.</p>
<p>I Examined carefully the records not only while I was in office, but since &amp; up to this date.</p>
<p>I also made similar Examination from the <date when="1847-09-13">13th Septr 1847</date>, which was before Kremer came to Louisville, if he came at the time stated in his declaration of intentions to become a citizen, and yet find no other charges against him but those already mentioned. His wife is an old, almost helpless women.</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Robert J. Elliott
