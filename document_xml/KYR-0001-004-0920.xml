<p>The appearance &amp; age of the witnesses, <hi rend="str">tha</hi> who drank in the house of Mr. Henneberger is such as to induce the belief that they are of Lawful age. Mr Henneberger admitted the selling and said that, he did not know, but <hi rend="str">what</hi> that, they were of age</p>

<p>I concur in the above statement. Have known Petitioner for several years, he is a verry quiet clever man &amp; so far as I know and believe he has kept an orderly well conducted drinking House</p>
