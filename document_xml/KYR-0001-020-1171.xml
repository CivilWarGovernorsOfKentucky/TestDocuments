<lb/>Govenor Magoffin
<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir,</p>
<p>At the last <date when="1861-05">May</date> Term of our Clark Circuit, Judgts upon two indictments for Gaming of $20. each were rendered against Samuel J Combs Jr. Combs Repleived both Judgts with James H Ogden as security, and died in a few days after without any estate of any kind. Combs was quite a young man, and his security Odgen was induced to go upon his Bonds from the consideration of kindness, and with the hope to induce Combs not to game any more -- Ogden is a young man himself, poor, with a large family, and the payment of these Judgts <hi rend="underline">just now</hi> fall heavily upon him -- If your Excellency could grant him a Remission, it would be most thankfully acknowledged by him, and be regarded as a favour to you</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>W. S Downey
<lb/>(over)<pb/></p>
<p>I cordially concur with W S Downey Esq in his recommendation that the fine against Saml J Combs Jr be remitted, and his statements as to the condition of the parties.</p>
