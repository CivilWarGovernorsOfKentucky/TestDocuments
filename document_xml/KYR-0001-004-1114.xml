   <p>Bowling Green Kentucky
<lb/><date when="1864-08-03">August 3rd. 1864</date>
<lb/>To his Excellency Thos. E. Bramlette,
<lb/>Govr. of Kentucky.</p>
<p>At the present <date when="1864-07">July term 1864</date> of the Warren Circuit Court H. P. Allen confessed a judgment in favor of the Commonwealth of Ky for the sum of one Thousand &amp; fifty dollars (1.050 <hi rend="sup">00</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi>) upon an Indictment therein pending against him for the "Offense of engaging in the business of a Broker without license" -- The offense was committed during the time the Confederate army &amp; "Provisional Government of Kentucky" were in the occupation &amp; had the complete control of the town of Bowling-Green (where the offense was committed) and the adjacent country in the fall &amp; winter of <date when="1861">1861.</date> His business consisted in buying the Bank notes of the Southern States &amp; Confederate notes &amp; bonds for which he paid gold &amp; silver -- charging a premium of from 20 to 40 per ct. During said time a large army was located at Bowling Green and to subsist it their authorities purchased from our citizens their crops &amp;c paying therefor in the Bank notes of the Southern states &amp; in<pb/>
<lb/>Confederate notes, &amp; which notes said citizens were bound to accept or have their crops, stock &amp;c taken without compensation &amp; subjecting themselves perhaps to other dangers for refusing. By this means many thousands of dollars of such paper were placed in the hands of our people &amp; if they had been compelled to hold it until after the Federal army had occupied our town it would have been rendered almost valuless in their hands, from which they would have suffered almost irreparably. On the other hand by having the opportunity of exchanging same for coin our farmers, upon the coming in of the Union Army, were found with more money (in coin) in their possession than they had, perhaps, ever before had. We therefore think the business of Mr. Allen, &amp; some others in like manner engaged, was of almost incalculable benefit to our people &amp; drew from the Rebel Army a large amount of their coin. Under all the circumstances we are of the opinion that your Excellency would do right in remitting said<pb/>
<lb/>fine or judgment &amp; we earnestly and respectfully request that you do so.</p>
<p>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> B Jones atty for the Comth</p>
<p>I parted with, volentarily or otherwise, a good deal of stock &amp; "<hi rend="underline">truck</hi>," generally whilst the rebels were here &amp; had as a matter of course, to take Southern money but converted the Same into <hi rend="underline">coin</hi> immediately &amp; feel that the brokers done me &amp; the public a great favor in purchasing the depreciated paper we were required to take &amp; therefore unite in the prayer of the petition</p>

<p>I was a refugee from home when the Rebels occupied Bowlinggreen but heartily concur in the petition believing from the information since derived from my neighbors that the business of a broker conducted by H P Allen was highly beneficial to the Citizens of the Town &amp; County</p>

<p>I believe the business of a broker in Bowling Green Ky -- at the time the Rebels were here, was a <hi rend="underline">positive</hi> good to the people &amp; therefor I concur in the petition -- </p>

<p>I was by necessity in Bowlinggreen, during the whole time it was occupied by the rebel army. Considering the circumstances then surrounding us, when but few, beside myself, had faith, that said army would soon be driven from the place, and the larger number of our people were utterly despondent, I am clearly opinion, it is right that Mr. Allen be relieved from the fine, to the extent that the govenor has power to remit. <date when="1864-08-03">Augt 3- 1864</date></p>
