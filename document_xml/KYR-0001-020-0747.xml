<lb/>Dr Sir-</p>
<p>I am advised a Petition has been presented to you. Asking your interposition in behalf of Rufus Jones who was convicted &amp; sentenced to four years confinement in the Penitentiary at the last term of the Warren Equity &amp; Criminal Court on a charge of Murder Have made it a rule not to unite in petitions of this Kind in cases where convictions are had before me and have uniformly adhered to this rule. You will pardon me for violating it in this instance.</p>
<p>Am Advised the evidence introduced upon the trial will also be presented with the petition. I regard it as one of the most unfortunate occurances that has ever come under my observation. Am satisfied the young man would not have done the act if he had not been intoxicated at the time. He is of fine family. all of his relations so far as<pb/>
<lb/>are acquainted with them, are Elevated high toned, law abiding citizens, and this accurence is peculiarly afflicting to them. Although the evidence fully justified his conviction &amp; no new trial could be granted, still there are circumstances connected with the case, which I think would justify the interposition of Executive Clemency in his behalf -- If you can make it consistent with your sense of duty to interpose in his behalf, You will by so doing confer a very great favor on his friends, who are every way worthy of your Kind consideration. Such an act too, would I think, meet with the approbation of a large majority of those conversant with the facts of this case -- Again craving your pardon for thus trespassing upon your time &amp; patience in this every I remain</p>
<p>Very Truly Yours
<lb/>Charles Green</p>
<p>To his Excellency
<lb/>Beriah Maggoffin }</p>
