   <p>We the undersigned respectfully represent to your Excellency, that Isaac N. Webb Esq<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hotel keeper at Cynthiana was immersed in a fine of Twenty dollars at the <date when="--05">May Term</date> of the Harrison Circuit Court for an alleged, violation of law in permitting a Mulatto Boy in his imploy to Sell Liquor at the Bar of the Hotel. The circumstances we believe were these. At the time our Town &amp; Country were in great confusion, Soldiers quartered amongst us and daily passing &amp; repassing, Our Landlords could not control things as formerly, Webb generly kept his Bar in Person, he kept the Boy about the Hotel as a Waiter or Porter &amp; made him Sleep in the Bar at night for Safety, Webb would sometimes leave the Bar in business hours for a short time, and those persons, citizens and Soldiers would make the boy give them whiskey or help themselves to what they wanted, and we believe, many times failing to pay for the Same, until they Eat up &amp; darank his Substance, until he could not keep up the house for want of Means, and he left the house, Most of his household furniture being levied on by his Creditors and before the day of Sale, the Hotel and furniture in it was taken for a Hospital by Co<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Mott of the 118 Regt. O V. I. and Several Small Pox Cases moved into it using the Beds &amp; furniture, which prevented the Sale for Several months, and when the house was vacated by the Military the property was Sold at a great Sacrifice in consequence of the Small Pox cases thereby injureing Said Webb greatly, therefore we Pray you will remit the Fine, this <date when="1863-12-08">8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Dec<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. 1863</date>.</p>
