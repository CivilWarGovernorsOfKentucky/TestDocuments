   <p>EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,
<lb/>Frankfort, Ky., <date when="1862-07-01">July 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, 1862</date>.
<lb/>Hon O P Hogan
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>All I can say to you in answer to your letter is that under the laws and Constitution of both State and Nation as expounded by the Courts the people have a right to become candidates go<hi rend="str">t</hi> to the polls and vote for such persons as they may choose, for their agents to carry out their will -- This is the basis of our Republcan institutions as heretofore acknowledged by all parties, and I cannot beleive that any one especially those who say they Stand up for the "Constitution the Union and the enforcement of the laws" -- will by force attempt to violate this principle^*^ I Take it for granted that the threat you spoke of is unauthorized -- from the practice you mention and made by interested parties to frighten the people from the polls -- </p>
<p>Respectfully Your friend &amp; Obedient Servant
<lb/>B Magoffin -- </p>
<p><hi rend="str">N. B.</hi>*I have not as you are aware a soldier or a dollar to enforce the laws or protect the people in their rights under the Constitution -- </p>
<p>A copy Attest Nat Gaither Jr
<lb/>Secy of State<pb/></p>
<p>Copy of letter to O, P, Hogan</p>
