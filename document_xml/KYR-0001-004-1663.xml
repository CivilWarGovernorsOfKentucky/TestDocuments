Ann Denny to make her appearance at the last term of this Court -- Mrs. Denny was accused of Manslaughter and sent on to further trial and was advised by many good citizens that it would be unsafe for her to return here on account of threats from deceased friends. &amp; relatives. The whole community here Justify the homicide and state the woman was not to blame and was only remanded to further trial to avoid violence and danger, I heard the proof before the Grand Jury and do not think, the expartee examination would Justify conviction I deemed it my duty under the law to take Judgment on the forfeiture and leave the matter to Executive Clemency where it belonged I have remitted portion<pb/>
<lb/>of my fees. I make these statements as an act of Justice to two old men -- one of them the Grand father of the woman.</p>
