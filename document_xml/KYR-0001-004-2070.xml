<lb/>His Excellency Thomas E Bramlet. Governer of Kentucky
<lb/>Dr Sir</p>
<p>I would not address you this -- letter -- but fearing that the press of public business &amp; calls of public duty, have caused you to overlook a petition, signed by a great many of the most respectable citizens of Maysville in behalf of a poor-ignorant Irish man -- I therefore address to call your attention to the matter -- if <unclear>hapily</unclear> it has escaped your attention It is the petition of <hi rend="underline">Patrick</hi> <hi rend="underline">Nyland</hi> of this place or rather in his behalf. the petition of<pb/>
<lb/>of many citizens of Maysville well &amp; personally known to yourself -- The petition was forwarded to you at Frankfort, some time in the early part of August last -- but no response has been received by Clerk of Mason Circuit Court -- Your early attention to the matter, will much oblige the many petitioners whose names are therto signed, as well as your very humble fellow citizen &amp;c</p>
