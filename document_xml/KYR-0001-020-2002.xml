   <p>To Hon B Magoffin,
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>We would respectfully represent that Con M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Auliffe, of Frankfort, has been indicted and fined in the Franklin Circuit Court, for selling liquor to Young Mr Bates, who, it appears, was not quite 21 years of age when the liquor was sold to him Mr. Bates has the appearance of being of full age, and we have no doubt that Mr. M Auliffe beleived he was of full age at the time. Any one would readily conclude that Mr Bates was at least 21.</p>
<p>Wherefore we ask your Excellency to remit said fine</p>
<p>Gov -- Under the circumstances of this case as presecribed The fine ought to be remitted</p>
<p>E S Nutall
<lb/>P. U. Major
<lb/>Jno. A Crittenden
<lb/>W Franklin</p>
<p>Con M Auliffe makes oath and says that at the time he sold the liquor to young Bates he has a regular license to sell liquor -- That Bates looks like he is over 21 -- That Bates told him at the time the liquor was sold to him that he was in his 22nd year -- and this affiant had every reason to believe his statement true, and sold him a dram under this belief He states that he had no intention to violate the law, and does not yet believe that he really did violate it, although he has been fined $50 for it<pb/></p>
