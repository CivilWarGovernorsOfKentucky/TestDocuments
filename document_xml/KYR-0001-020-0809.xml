<lb/>ATTORNEYS AT LAW,
<lb/>Flemingsburg <hi rend="str">Maysville</hi>, Ky, <gap/> 186<gap/>
<lb/>My dear Governor,</p>
<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thomas Barber, Jr, was at the present term of the Fleming Circuit Court, found guilty upon an indictment for a breach of of his tavern bond, in permitting disorderly conduct on his premises, and judgment rendered against him and his surety, Greenup Pickerel, for $300, The proof showed that his bar was kept by his aged father, and that in the case of a single individual, who testified against M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Barber, his father had permitted him to drink on some occasions none then was necessary, In other respects the house was proved to be orderly, and no disturbances or other disorders had taken place at the house,</p>
<p>I think the case is one that appeals to your mercy, and, therefore, recommend that the judgment be remitted, so far as you have the power, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Barber himself attended<pb/>
<lb/>a mill near the premises and was not present when the tippling complained of occurred, He is a worthy man, and I commend him to your clemency,</p>
<p>With respect,
<lb/>Your Obt Sevt,
<lb/>R H Stanton</p>
<p>Hon B M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin</p>
<p>I fully concur in the foregoing letter of Hon. R. H. Stanton. and Sincerely Trust that your Excellency will remit the same</p>
