<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>inclosed find the Petition of H Elmore &amp; John C. Burns in which your Excellency is Petitioned to release them of a fine for keeping a gambling house in the Town of Smithland the facts set forth in the Petition so far as relates to the evidence in the cause are strictly true &amp; there is scarcly any man in the country aware that such games as those <hi rend="str">pare</hi> playd in Elmores &amp; Burns house are offenses against the laws of the state &amp; it is believed that since they are<pb/>
<lb/>apprised of the fact that such games are prohibited by law that they will not be guilty of like offenses any more So you would confer a favor by releasing them of the penalty which is manifestly unjust &amp; oppressive</p>
<p>Yours &amp;c
