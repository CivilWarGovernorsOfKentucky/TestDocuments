<lb/>To his Excelency Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bramlette</p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully represent that at the present Term of the Hopkins Circuit Court a Judgment was rendered in behalf of the Commonwealth against Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi> James M Shackelford. and Israel Davis upon a forfeited Recognizance amounting to three hundred dollars they being bail for the appearance of Thomas Scales at a previous term of said Court charged with stabing with intent to Kill. They state that the appearance of said Scales at the said term was impossible he being at the time a prisoner <hi rend="str">of</hi> confined in the Jail at Clarksville Tennessee and that under the circumstances it was out of the power of said Bail to deliver him up. that said Scales has since been sent to the penitentiary for five years from Clarksville Tenn. believeing that the Bail has done all in their power to procur the attendance of said Scales under the circumstances it would work injustice to them. They ask therefore that amount of said judgment be remitted by your Excellency.</p>
