   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>B. Magoffin Gov of Ky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I hope you will excuse me for troubling you in behalf of a poor <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> old friend of mine of Monroe County Who states that he has been fined the Sum of $50 &amp; costs for playing cards for ^whiskey^ <hi rend="str"><unclear/> <unclear/></hi> to wit. $20 at Criminal &amp; Equity Court of Monroe at their <date when="1860-04">April Term of 1860</date> &amp; $30 &amp; costs at last ocr. Term of Said Court.</p>
<p>Both offenses were committed On the same day.<pb/>
<lb/>Your petitioner Elijah Strode states that he has replieved both of the before mentioned debts which replevy will be out about the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of next month. He therefore prayes your Excellency in view of the hard times to grant him a respite, so as to afford him time to make a crop &amp; vend it, to procure the money to pay off said debts &amp; thereby save what little property he has now, from being sacrificed.</p>
<p>Your petitioner states that he has a wife &amp; five children &amp; but <hi rend="underline">very</hi> little property bearely enough to pay off the said debts if it is put under the hammer.<pb/>
<lb/>You will please Governor if it meets your approbation to grant the the indulgence <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> asked for (&amp;I hope it will) to address the petitioner Elijah Strode at Tompkinsville Ky And in duty bound he will ever pray &amp;c</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>your friend
