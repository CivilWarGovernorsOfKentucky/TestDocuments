Term of the Nicholas Circuit Cour 1863</date> she &amp; her husband were indicted for retailing Liquor by the Small -- and at <date when="1864-03">March Court ^1864^</date> she was found guilty &amp; her husband acquitted &amp; she understands was fined $60. She says one witness proved once selling by her since the License expired but no selling by her husband -- </p>
<p>She says she let the witness have the whiskey, but it was not paid for -- The witness however said he paid for it &amp; hence the fine -- she says they did not sell nor keep whiskey or any liquor for sale after the License expired &amp; this case was the only complaint agt. them -- </p>
<p>She says they are poor, that they cannot pay the fine, they have no means with which to pay it -- They have a family of 6 children &amp; all depend upon your Petitioner &amp; husband for support</p>
<p>Wherefore she prays the fine to be remitted &amp; will ever pray &amp;c.</p>
<p>Mary Stoker<pb/></p>
<p>We are acquainted with the parties some of whom are Neighbors &amp; we recommend that the fine be remitted</p>
