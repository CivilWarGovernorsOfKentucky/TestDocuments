<p>At the <date when="1861-05">May term 1861</date> of the Equity &amp; criminal court for Hickman county a Judgment was rendered on an Indictment for Tipling in favor of the Commonwealth against James Zimmerman for $60 -- the facts are these. A. J. Benton a Licened Hotel Keeper Sold to Zimmerman a partnership interest in his Bar. Zimmerman attended the Bar and Sold whiskey by the drink believing &amp; having been told that the tavern license of his partner would protect him as soon as he learned he had no right to Sell under his partners tavern license, he quit the business Zimmerman is Jailor of Hickman county a highly respectable citizen and was never Known to violate the law in any way -- I therefore pray your Excellency to remit said fine</p>
