<lb/>His Excellency 
<lb/>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Bramlette. 
<lb/>Sir.</p>
<p>I know the bearer Sam<hi rend="sup">L</hi>. Miles of M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cracken County- hardworking honest man, kind in his feelings especially towards his children- has wife &amp; five children- and the rebels have stript him of his best personal property, leaving him with no property of much value except 133. acres of land, and if he lose this, he is made helpless &amp; homeless- as to his son, I have no doubt he thought &amp; still thinks he was innocent- He went his bail in three cases- and now stands in his old age on the verge of ruin. if his son is ever back, he will be caught. The fee of Commth's atto, will well nigh place him beyond the hope of saving his farm and home- If any part of the ballance be enforced all is gone with him, sure.- Were I Governor I would relieve him, and hence my only reason for asking your excellency to do so- I am known to many citizens in Frankfort-</p>
<p>Respectfully 
<lb/>your Excellencys ob<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> sv<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
