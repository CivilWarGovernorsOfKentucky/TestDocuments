   <p>To His Excellency Thos. E Bramlette. Gov of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your petitioner Moses Moore humbly prays a hearing of his complaint and that your Excellency may grant his petition. He says some time since he was bound over to keep the peace in the sum of $200. That since said time he has been a quiet &amp; peacable citizen. That a few days since he was fined, in the Lexington City Court, five dollars for a breach of the peace. That though he complaineth not of this judgement. he feels he was not entirely responsible for said breach &amp; violation of law. But it was adjudged he had forfeited his bond to keep the peace. and that it would be a very great hardship for him to pay the said $200. That he is a poor man &amp; with a large familly. they are dependent on him for their maintenance. That the payment of this sum would embarrass him greatly &amp; work an injury to his family Wherefore he prays your Excellency to remit said forfeiture &amp; relieve him &amp; family from such injury &amp; embarrasment.<pb/></p>
