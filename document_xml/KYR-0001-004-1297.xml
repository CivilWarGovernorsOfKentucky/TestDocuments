   <p>To His Excellency, Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E. Bramlette, Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>The petition of R. Sullivan, of Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, who respectfully sheweth to your Excellency:</p>
<p>That on the <date when="1864-02-23">23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> day of February, 1864,</date> your petitioner executed five bail bonds, for one thousand dollars each, as the bail or surety of James W. Sullivan, for the appearance of the latter in the Muhlenberg Circuit Court to answer Indictments found against him in said Court; that the said James W. Sullivan had been Committed &amp; was confined in Jail, when said bonds were executed; that the same were given in good faith, on the part of your petitioner, and not with any intent to defeat the ends of Justice.</p>
<p>That the said James W. Sullivan, before the time fixed for his appearance, as aforesaid, departed from this State, and has been absent therefrom ever since, and it is highly improbable that he will ever return -- he left with the intention of going to Mexico</p>
<p>Your petitioner would respectfully represent that he is fifty five years old -- has a family of motherless children dependent on him for maintenance, part of them are helpless &amp; afflicted; that it would ruin him to pay said bail bonds; that he has ever honestly tried to do his best to be faithful and true as a father, &amp; as a citizen in all the relations of life. He respectfully but earnestly asks a remission of the judgments rendered on said bail bonds. Copies of the bonds and of the Judgments rendered thereon<pb/>
<lb/>are annexed to this petition -- </p>
<p>Raughley Sullivan</p>
<p>Subscribed &amp; sworn to before me a Notary Public of Muhlenberg County this <date when="1864-11-17">Nov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 17 1864</date></p>
<p>J R Strange N. P. M. C.</p>
<p>The undersigned members of the bar &amp; court and citizens of Muhlenberg County, endorse the statements of the foregoing petition of R. Sullivan, and concur in the prayer thereof for a remission of the Judgments referred to. They take pleasure in testifying to the good character of R. Sullivan. As <hi rend="str">a</hi> citizen, husband, father, nieghbor, and member of church, his conduct and character deserve commendation and command respect. It would be ruinous to him to have ^to pay^ said judgments. They earnestly commend and respectfully urge the application of M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Sullivan for Executive clemency. The poignancy of his grief over the disgrace of his son, and the humiliation, have been profound and deep. A remisson of the judgments by your Excellency would receive the approval of good citizens generally, ^who are^ acquainted with the man &amp; the circumstances. <date when="1864-11-17">Nov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 17, 1864 -- </date></p>
