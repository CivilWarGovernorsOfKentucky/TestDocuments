<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E Bramlett Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned petitioner would respectfully represent that she is the mother of Jonathan Ward who now is and has been since the <gap/> day of <date when="1858-04">April 1858</date> confined in the Penitentiary of this state.</p>
<p>That she is and has been for many years a widow in a helpless and destitute condition That she is unable to labor for her support. And oweing to her advanced age and from the effects of ^Chronic inflammatory rheumatism^ which has rendered her almost helpless. she must in the future be almost wholy dependent upon her friends for support</p>
<p>Your petitioner would further represent that her son was confined in the penitentiary for the murder of Nathan Castle but if he was guilty of the charge the act was committed in a drunken frolick and not with malice aforethought</p>
<p>If guilty surely he has fully atoned for the offence and if not guilty surely he has been kept long enough from a widowed and helpless mother.</p>
<p>For these considerations I would therefore ask your Excellency to grant him a release that he may return home to comfort and support his aged mother</p>
<p>Malinda ^her X mark^ Ward<pb/></p>
<p>Your petitioners being well acquainted with Jonathan Ward who is now confined in the state penitentiary and also with his aged and widowed mother would respectfully represent that the foregoing petition presents the case fairly. And we would respectfully ask your Excellency to grant the request of his helpless mother</p>
