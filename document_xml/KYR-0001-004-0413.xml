   <p>To his Excellency.
<lb/>Thomas E Bramlette.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner William Laswell would most respectfully represent unto your Excellency, that at the <date when="1864-08">August term of the Rockcastle Circuit Court 1864</date> there was <hi rend="str">Foun</hi> a Judgment rendered against him for the sum of $20 -- in favor of the Commonwealth of Ky</p>
<p>He states that prior to the Indictment and Judgment aforesaid he had in good faith procured a Licinse from the Rockcastle County Court for the purpose of Keeping a Hotel. But the<hi rend="str">n</hi> Court did not require him to take the Oath prescribed by the late act of the General Assembly and he did not know that it was necessary to take such oath, and in fact did not know that such an oath was required by the law. He states that he innocently went on &amp; retailed spirits without the oath, until he found out it was necessary, when we took it. He thinks it unjust <hi rend="str">that</hi> if he has said debt or Judgment to pay, as he acted in good faith and honesty.</p>
<p>Wherefore he prays that your Excellency will remit said Judgment.</p>
<p>William Laswell</p>
