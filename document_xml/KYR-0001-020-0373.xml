   <p>To His Excelency
<lb/>Beriah Magoffin Gov. of Ky,</p>
<p>Your petitioners would most Repsectfully and urgently recommend the Releice of John W Cornelius from two Bonds as Surety for John A Taylor to the Commonwealth, in the Christian Circuit Court, one for two hundred dollars for Gaiming; the other for Sixty dollars for Keeping a Tipling house: Said Cornelius has ever been a good and orderly and Law abiding citizen: he was a neighbor of said Taylor and was induced to go on his Bonds for his appearance at the next term of the Court; and a Band of men styling themselves regulators, drove the said Taylor off from the County before the <hi rend="str">said</hi> next term of <hi rend="str">the</hi> said Court: Thereby preventing him from appearing in discharge of his said Bonds; whilst your petitioners would say nothing as between Taylor and the Commonwealth, they would strongly recomend the cancelling of the Bonds So far as John W Cornelius is concerned we think it a case worthy of Executive clemency</p>
