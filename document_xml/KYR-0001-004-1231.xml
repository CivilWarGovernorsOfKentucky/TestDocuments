   <p>To His Excellency Thos. E. Bramlette Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Frank Short would respectfully represent that, at this, the <date when="1864-10">Oct. Term 1864,</date> he was fined the sum of Two Hundred Dollars for permitting gaming in his house in this city -- He would represent the facts in the case to be as follows. In the month of <date when="1863-04">april 1863.</date> He kept a small confectionary establishment in Frankfort -- And in order to <hi rend="underline">draw</hi> customers to his house -- he set up in the back room thereof -- a table called a "Pigeon Hole" Table. That said table was used only for the amusement of those who frequented his store &amp; that he received from each one five cents for the priviledge of playing on the table -- And that in return for the 5 cts <hi rend="str">the</hi>he so received he gave each one who played at the game a "check" with the following writing on it -- "good for 5 cts in refreshments -- Frank Short" -- this intitled the holder of the check to five cents worth of goods in your petitioners store, He positively prohibited any and all betting on said table, Your petitioner is a very poor man &amp; has a large family to support &amp; that he is unable to pay the fine imposed upon him -- &amp; if compelled to satisfy the same he will have to be confined in jail -- Wherefore he prays that your Excellency will remit so much of said fine as is not due to the offecirs of the court &amp;c -- </p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Frank Short</p>
