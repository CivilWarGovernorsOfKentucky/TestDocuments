   <p>Lexington Ky. <date when="1863-07-18">July. 18. 1863</date>
<lb/>To His Excelency Gov Robeson -- 
<lb/>Frankfort. Ky.</p>
<p>The undersigned petitioner W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> F. White of this city of Lexington Ky did sometime in <date when="1862-07">July -- 1862</date>. became the surety of one R H Thompson a resident of the city for several years -- on a bail bond for the sum of five Hundred dollars. The said Thompson was -- a man of a family -- and had little or no means -- his family being entirely dependant upon him for a living -- He was indicted for obtaining some property under false pretenses and held to bail in the sum of five hundred dollars. Through sympathy for his family I became his surety -- on the bond -- and but for the fact of the Confederate forces -- having taken this city I was safe and ran no risk and at the time of going on his bond I considered him a Union man and had no idea of his leaving the country. But for some cause he did leave when Braggs army evacuated this city and has since been within the confederate lines placing himself <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>entirely out of reach of any process to bring him to the court -- of this district. Your petitioner prays you to release him from all of the bond<pb/>
<lb/>save the attorneys fee &amp; cost -- he being illy able at present to pay said bond.</p>
