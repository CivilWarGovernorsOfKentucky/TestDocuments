   <p>To his Excellency Hon Thos E. Bramlette Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully State that on yesterday Tarlton Broaddus was convicted by a jury of Garrard County of the offence of Grand Larceny, and his punishment fixed at confinement in in the Penitentiary for four years.</p>
<p>They state that the facts developed in the trial showed the following. The accused was a member of Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Wolford's Cavalry and on his way to his home in Mercer County in passing through Garrard County his horse was fatigued and he was unwell and being desirous to press forward; he gave a negro man one dollar to get him a horse to ride, the negro brought him an Iron Gray horse the property of George Robinson which he rode home. Robinson and his friends went in pursuit of the horse and by his tracks and other evidence they traced the horse to the home of the mother of accused. They did not find the horse there, but the accused was at home, the horse had been traded to a neighbor by a Brother of the accused, but by whose authority was not known. Upon promises to the accused that he should not be arrested if he would tell all about the horse (that all Robinson wanted was his horse) he told where the horse was and the part<hi rend="str">y</hi>ies went and got him. The accused was brought to Lancaster in <date when="1863-02">Feby 1863</date> and confined in jail untill the present <hi rend="str">time</hi> term on yesterday being unable to give<pb/>
<lb/>bail. The jury was satisfied that the horse was taken with a felonious intent and assessed his punishment at the shortest period of confinement.</p>
<p>Your Petitioners think as Robinson has recovered his horse, and the accused has already been confined in the County Jail for one year, that it will be but the part of clemency to release him from further confinement.</p>
