   <p>To the Govenor of the State of Kentucky The undersigned who was appointed by the court to defend and the Commonwealth atty state that Phillip Cormany was tried and convicted to the Penitentiary of Ky for the period of Seven years for the killing of a man by the name of Hines at the <date when="1859-03">march Term of the Pulaski Circuit Court 1859</date> that he is now in said Penetentiary The proof and circumstances in the case a abundantly showed that he was a man of very weak mind approaching very nearly to Idiocy that he was greatly under the influence of Liquor at the time and when under the influence of Liquor he was bereft of what mind he had, that before the killing took place he had been very badly treated by two man Shellery and Lynn_ one had held him and the other had pissed on him Lynn had drawn a dangerous knife on him twice and made at him to thrust it in him that Just about the time he shot Hines (which was at the door of ^a^ drinking house where a good many persons were of assembled and drinking Liquor) that <hi rend="str">Hines</hi> Lynn walked to him where he was peaceably standing and slapped him in the face and ordered him out of the house<pb/>
<lb/>Cormany went out and as he went Lynn followed him with his knife drawn and Just as Cormany passed out of the door he turned and fired and Hines fell the witness ^thought^ it was Lynn that fell the officer immediately arrested Cormany who asked what for: the officer said for killing that man. Cormany replied I told ^him^ if he drew his knife on <hi rend="str">him</hi> ^me^ again <hi rend="str">he</hi> ^I^ would kill him ^It was also proven that the Pistol with which he shot he had taken from me other means <unclear/> <unclear/> Just a short time before the shooting^ we think it would be proper to pardon him <date when="1861-01-17">Jan 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1861</date></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Sherrod Williams</hi></p>
<p>I think the foregoing statements toleraby accurate, there was no doubt that Cormony did not intend to kill Hinds. he aimed to shoot Lynn, who was an aggressor upon him at the time</p>
<p>E L Vanwinkle atto</p>
<p>Phillip Cormany who is now in the Penitintiary of Kentucky for the killing of Hines is a poor Ignorant creature has a wife and three infant children who have no means of support. we the ^undersigned citizens of Pulaski County^ petition The Govenor to pardon him and Let him come home and work to keep his wife &amp; children from starvation:</p>
