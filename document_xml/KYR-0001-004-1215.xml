<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E Bramlett
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners will respectfully ^state^ to your excellency, That at the last <date when="1865-03">March term</date> of the Ballard Circuit Court John Right was tried and fined Thirty Dollars on an Indictment for maliciously wounding a steer the property of D. M. Myres, The facts as detailed by <gap/> The witnesses was Substancially as follows Myres had a very breachy steer and he had been getting into said Rights corn field and running through his tobacco thereby eating up his corn and breaking down his tobacco, It was also proven that the said Right lived on a rented place and the fence around it was not such a one as the law requires, consequently the Jury was bond to fine under the Instructions of the court, notwithstanding the evidence showed that right threw the axe at the steer while in his field destroying his little crop, and said immediately after he done it that it was done in the moment of excitement, and was sorry that he had done it, Right is an exceedingly poore man with a helpless family and no one to work for them but himself, and is not able to pay said fine, and will have<pb/>
<lb/>to go to Jail, unless your Excellency Interpose and release the said Right of so much of said fine as in your power to do, Which we respectfully petition your Excellency to do,</p>
<p>Very Respectfully your petitioners &amp;c
