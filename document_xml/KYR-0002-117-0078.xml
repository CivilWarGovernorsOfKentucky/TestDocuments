<lb/>Hon. John E. Newman.
<lb/>Harrodsburg -- Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Gov. Bramlette read me a letter he had received last night from yourself stating that John D. Hale had represented that his outrageous interference with your court and its proceedings had been explained to the satisfaction of the Adjutant General. This is false -- and I am glad to know you placed no faith in the report. Hale said he was not present when Patterson was taken from court -- that he did not know he was on trial -- that as soon as he heard it he apologized to you, and offered to return Patterson to your custody, which you refused. This statement seemed to be made to mitigate the feeling I expressed towards such an outrage. Hale was ordered off at once -- directed to keep his men under close guard, while near Harrodsburg, and to deliver Patterson if you would recieve him. Knowing the fellow well, his statements did not impose on me. Orders have been given to relieve your court from ^the danger of^ a repetition of such offense -- which I trust will prove efficacious, and as far as possible remedial and satisfactory</p>
<p>Your obt. Serv't.
<lb/><hi rend="underline">John Boyle</hi>
<lb/>Adjt. Gen. of Ky.</p>
