   <p>His Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>The Petitioner George W. Utley States that at the <date when="1864-05">May term of the Hopkins Circuit Court 1864</date> he was summoned as a witness in behalf of the Commonwealth in an action wherein the Commonwealth was plaintiff and C. S. Wiatt was defendant, that in Obedience to said Subpena he appeared at the Court house of Hopkins County in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day of said term of court -- He further states that he lived some distance in the Country and that he on the morning of the day aforesaid <hi rend="str">he</hi> rode a stallion to town, and hitched him as he thought securely, that immediately before the action was called or reached on the Docket, some gentleman informed him that his stallion had broken loose and was then running at large -- That he (petitioner) believing that it was his first and paramount duty to pursue capture and bring to submission the aforesaid stallion, left the court room for that purpose, That whilst he was out the case was called and he was fined ten dollars for his non-appearance in behalf of the Comth He states that after his return to the Court room which was not long after the case was called he was informed that he had been fined<pb/>
<lb/>&amp;c -- That he applied to the presiding Judge at the time Hon W. P. Fowler, for a remission of the fine, at the same time giving him a succinct statement of the facts -- that the Judge promised to remit said fine at a future day of the Session, being busily engaged Just then -- </p>
<p>That soon after and long before the tirmination of the Session, domestic duties, unceremoniously called Judge Fowler to his home -- That Petitioner again at the <date when="1864-11">Nov<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. term 1864,</date> of said Court made application to Judge F for a remission of said fine, that Judge F. again promised him he would cause said fine to be remitted ^if in his power^ But that through inadvertince or inattention ^want of power^ to the business it was again deferred</p>
<p>That execution for said fine is now in <hi rend="str">behalf</hi> the hands of J. S. Robertson sheriff of Hopkins County that he is informed and beleives that it is now beyond the power of Judge Fowler to remit said fine.</p>
<p>Wherefore He prays your excellency to remit said fine &amp;c</p>
<p>George, W, Utley</p>
<p>witness
<lb/>R. J. Littlepage<pb/></p>
<p>I am under the impression that most of the facts stated in the foregoing petition are correct I think I posponed according to my habit all remissions in absence of witnesses &amp; Jurors until the close of the court in order to ensure promptness I was called home from that court unexpectedly</p>
