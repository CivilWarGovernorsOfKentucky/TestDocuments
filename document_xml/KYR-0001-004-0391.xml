<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I enclose you the petition of Jerry J Martin to the Gov. to be discharged from a fine imposed on him at the <date when="1863-09">September term 1863</date> for $200. I wish you would use every exertion you can to have the fine remitted, for it is a matter of great importance to him as he is not able to pay it without the sale of his property. See Dr. Bell and get him to go with you to see the Gov. the petition &amp; accompaning letters present the case fully &amp; I think it a clear case for the clemency of the Gov. Get him to act on it at once and enclose to me. I could have got Thomas the atty for the Coml<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to have Joined in the prayer for remital, but it is a goodeal of trouble to write to him &amp; get an answer, &amp; this requires immediate attention</p>
<p>There is no news here, except a report that Peter Everett was killed as he returned from the Mt Sterling raid. But I somehow cant put much faith in the report, yet it may be true, as there was a force awaiting his return. The Govs message has been received and as far as I here, it is regarded as an able document I have heard no objections to it but much commendation<pb/></p>
<p>Tom Allen is lying very ill. I learn that he cannot recover The capt. has very much improved, he is at his office to day. you have all the news that we have in regard to the movement of the army. Therefore I will close by saying do all you can to put down the Rebels, and give strength to the Union. your friends are all will write me frequently &amp; I will answer promptly my Respects to Dr Bell &amp; accept for yourself sentiments of the highest regard &amp;c.</p>
<p>L. B. Cox</p>
