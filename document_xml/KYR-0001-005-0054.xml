   <p>Franklin Ky <date when="1865-08-10">10 Aug 1865</date>
<lb/>Gov Bramlette</p>
<p>I enclose you copies of eight Indictments Attested by our clerk, all of which are now pending in the Simpson Circuit Court. The<hi rend="str">se</hi>y are as you will see against Harper &amp; others. The others are those who composed a part of Harpers guerilla band. They are now spending most of their time in Sumner, and Robertson Counties Tennessee.</p>
<p>I wish to have them arrested under a requisition upon the Gov of Tennessee. We probably cannot obtain them all but may some of them, The reson I send so many against some of the parties is to reach others.</p>
<p>Send the requisition to me if proper to do so &amp; I will forward to Gov Brownlow.</p>
<p>I would suggest George W Dalton of Franklin Ky as a suitable agent to secure the parties if arrested. He is the Sheriff Simpson County and is true &amp; discreet. Please attend to this forthwith this is important</p>
