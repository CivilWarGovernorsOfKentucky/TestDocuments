   <p>To Hon. B Magoffin,
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your Petitioner, Joseph F. Roach, would respectfully represent that a little more than one year ago he was tried before a magistrate, in Clay Village, Shelby county, Kentucky, for a breach of the peace, &amp; a judgment obtained against him for $30. fine and 15 days imprisonment in the county jail.</p>
<p>Shortly after the judgment was rendered he applied to your Excellency for relief from said judgment. Your Excellency was kind enough to respite the entire judgment for one year, excepting fees &amp; costs. He has replevied the fees, and a part of the costs have been paid.</p>
<p>The suspension of the judgment has expired, &amp; he is advised that he is now liable to be seized and imprisoned under said judgment.</p>
<p>He is a poor-boy, not yet 21 years of age, and lives with his widowed mother.</p>
<p>This ruinous judgment was obtained against him through political prejudice and excitement.</p>
<p>Referring to his former petition which he presented to Your Excellency, and the names of ^his^ neighbors who joined in his prayer for pardon, he respectfully asks your Excellency to relieve him altogether from said judgment</p>
<p>Joseph F Roach his mark X

<p>Joseph F. Roach this day made oath before me that the statements of the foregoing affidavit are true. this <date when="1862-05-16">16 May 1862</date></p>
