<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Gov Robinson
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed you find, Judgements against the Justices of this County for a failure to keep a Suitable Jail, This is a case where executive Clemency, might verry justly be extended, I have acted as County Clerk for Eight years, and the officers of the County Court have from time to time made levies and appropriated the same to the repairs and comfort of the Jail, And with proper carful Jailers -- the Jail is ample and secure -- though close &amp; not very commodious yet -- there has not been any Searious Sickness in it, and in my Judgment no good reason to pronounce it unhealthy a new Jail is now offered to contractors but not yet <hi rend="underline">let</hi>. <hi rend="str">in</hi> With the facts all before me &amp; my personal Knowledge of Same -- I can not, hesitate in saying this is a proper action to exercise the power of your office in remitting the fines imposed.</p>
<p>Your Obt Sert
<lb/>Jesse N Reno Clk &amp; Trustee of Jury found for Muhg County Ky<pb/></p>
