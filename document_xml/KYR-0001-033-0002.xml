   <p>Louisville, Thursday
<lb/><date when="1862-10-30"><hi rend="underline">Oct</hi>. 30<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> 1862</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency,
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Gov</hi>. Robbertson
<lb/>Honorable Sir</p>
<p>Humbly beseeching Your favor, permit me to intimate the ostensible design in apropiateing time to the writing of this communication, is to supplicate Your clemency in my behalf.</p>
<p>Somewhat anomalous circumstances have irresistibly launched me into a most grievous misfortune, and You only have the power to extricate me from my overwhelming, lamentable and melancholy dilemma. You doubtless ere this, have had my case elaborately represented to you and in my desperate extremity the propriety was suggested of writing this appeal to Your humanity, clemency, and mercy, a few days since I was tried for the murder of Gotliep Diess. The jury found me guilty of murder in the first degree, with a reccommendation for Your clemency. You will allow me to observe that I was deprived of the benefit of some important evidence and albeit there were palliateing circumstances connected with the transaction, this heavy verdict was brought in against me.</p>
<p>Believe me, Your Excellency, no one regrets the deplorable and sad casuality more than myself, and with genuine contrition of heart I pray You to absolve me from the expiration of such<pb/> 
<lb/>a severe and ignominious penalty, by restoring me to the protection and support of my family. Not being familiar with the "modus operand" usually adopted in making such applications this may be defficient in many particulars, but I claim Your indulgence and hope You will make all necessary allowances for Your imperfections.</p>
<p>The Jury manageing my case were so kind to recommend me to Your attention, sympathy, and mercy, and I do most sincerely hope you will not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties and importunities of an unfortunate creature who has been plunged into such a vortex of perplexing desponency, torturing suspense and humiliateing woe. Be assured, Honorable sir, it is not my life I value so dearly. I plead for a wife and three dependent children, were it not for them I would care but little for my terrestrial existence. I am a mechanic and gain a sustenance for my family by my daily labor, wife and children depend upon me exclusively for their meagre support, and aside from the horrors of an ignominious execution, what would my conjugal companion and innocent little ones do without me to nourish and protect them through this troublesome and uncertain probation oh sir the thought of being torn assunder from the companionship and support of my wife and children almost drives me frantic, and I feel sir,<pb/>
<lb/>that You will but do an act of Justice in emancipateing me from my present thraldom. Forgive me, if my appeals are too enthusiastic, my solicitude for my wife and children is my only apology.</p>
<p>Excessive ceremony usually indicates ill-breeding, and as that civility which excludes all superfluous formality is the most acceptable with sensible, intelligent, matter-of-fact men, I will conclude by observing that Your magnanamous characteristics Justify me in the belief that the administration of Your executive authority will be guided by that Justice which is neither swayed by prejudace nor distorted by passion, but which is directed by virtuous determinations. Hopeing You will vouchsafe me a favorable hearing, by extending me Your commiseration, pity, and mercy, I subscribe Yours, cordially with the,</p>
<p>Highest Consideratio^'s^
