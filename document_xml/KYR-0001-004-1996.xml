   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E Bramlette Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>Dear Sir Edward B Sydnor, John Coakley, Lucinda Fields and Daniel Loyal, were respectively recognized as witnesses by a Court of Enquiry in the Country, to appear at the Court house in Greensburg at <date when="1864-11">November Court 1864,</date> to testify in the case of the Commonwealth, against Mary, a woman of color, the property of one Susan Coakley of Green County, charged with the murder of her own infant child, at the time of its birth -- which occured about the <gap/> day of <gap/> <date when="1864">1864 -- </date>The said Mary was arrested under a warrant from a Justice of the Peace and tried before two Magistrates in the country, at her residence some 15 miles from the Court house, the second day after the alledged Murder, and while the said Mary was sick and lying in bed -- The Court adjudged, that she ought to be tried in the Circuit Court, and failing to give Bail for her appearance at Court -- The Magistrates made out a mitimus which they delivered to the constable acting in the case, with directions, that as soon as she could be moved with safety, she was to be taken to the County Jail for confinement -- and said Constable was to keep her well guarded in the mean time -- A few days after the trial aforesiad, before the Court of Enquiry; the said negro woman Mary, charged with Murder as aforesaid, made her escape from the guard, and has not been heard of since -- I attended the trial as County Attorney, and prosecuted said slave Mary to conviction before the Magistrates -- The said Sydnor, Coakley, Fields and Loyal, made Petition and Affidavit to the Court at the <date when="1865-05">May term 1865,</date> to set aside the order of forfeiture, of bond as witnesses aforesaid, which bond had been forfeited at the said <date when="1864-11">November Court 1864,</date> and summons issued against the parties named above to appear at the present <date when="1865-05">(May)</date> term of this Court as is usual in such cases, to show cause &amp;C. said parties appeared in obedience to said<pb/>
<lb/>summons' and filed Petition and affidavit as above stated The Court did not think that their excuse was sufficient in law -- and their recognizances were therefore forfeited -- with an expression of opinion, that their case was deserving Executive interposition -- the parties above mentioned stated in their affidavit -- that some time previous to <date when="1864-11">November Court 1864,</date> said negro slave Mary, had left the country to parts unknown, and was not in the custody of the Court, and had not been from the time of her elopement even to this day, so far as they knew, or believed -- that her absence, or concealment was a matter of public notariety in the neighborhood -- and the said parties being advised by persons in whom they had confidence, (though not Lawyers) that there would be no use for them as witnesses, without the appearance in Court of the Defendant, and that they lived from 12 to 15 miles from the Court house -- and that their attendance would only be a useless and unnecessary expense to the Commonwealth, without any benefit -- they failed to attend that Court, not intending any contempt of the Court, or any of the legal constituted authorities, but simply for the reasons above stated -- The parties aforesaid, in obedience to the summons' aforesaid attended the present term of the Court, and testified before the Grand Jury, when an Indictment ^was^ found against said slave Mary, (although so far as they know or believe has not yet been heard of) and they have been recognized to appear at the next court to testify in the case, which they intend to do in good faith, being now fully advised, as to their duty -- The most of the parties aforesaid are in very humble circumstances, especially the lady M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. Lucinda Fields, a helpless widow -- The premises considered, I trust your Excellency will be pleased to remit the fines for the forfeiture of thier recognizances aforesaid, or so much thereof, at least as your Excellency can consistent with justice &amp; duty<pb/>
<lb/>I make this communication at the request of the parties aforesaid, being myself cognizant of the facts here stated -- The parties live some twelve or fifteen miles from Greensburg and any communication from you, will reach them sooner by addressing them at this office to my care -- </p>
<p>Very Respectfully and
<lb/>truly yours &amp;C
