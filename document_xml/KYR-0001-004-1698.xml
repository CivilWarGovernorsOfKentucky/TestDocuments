   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E Bramlette Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners J. G. Campbell, A S Wade &amp; J G Campbell, and George W Graves would state that they that is J G Campbell, ^individually^ A S Wade &amp; J G Campbell jointly and G. W. Graves individually by Judgments of the Marion Circuit Court Ky rendered at its <date when="1863-11">November term 1863</date> were fined the sum of Sixty dollars each &amp; costs under the alledged charges of Keeping Tippling houses. After the rendition of Said judgments, Your Petitioners applied to Your Excellency for a remission of said fines and Your Excellency very Kindly respited the same for twelve months and in the meantime Your Petitioners have paid to the Commonwealth attorney his part of Said judgments and the costs of the Same And Now the Commonwealth through her officers are proceeding to coerce the balance of Said judgments Your Petitioners would state that they have allways been law abiding citizens not only willing but anxious to pay their individual debts as well as their taxes &amp; dues to Federal State &amp; Municipal authorities -- Your Petitioner J. G. Campbell was at the time the offence was said to have been committed was &amp; had been for some<pb/>
<lb/>time a tavern keeper; And A S. Wade &amp; J. G. Campbell were the Keepers of a Restaurant and Coffe house in said town -- And G W Graves likewise -- They had each regularly obtained their liscence from County &amp; town authorities and paid for the same -- But on account of some misunderstanding betwean them and the trustees of said town a small space of time was made to appear between the dates of their liscences but as soon as they &amp; the trustees settled their misunderstanding they each procured new liscences &amp; paid for them -- Your Petitioners aver without fear of any statement to the contrary that they allways Kept orderly, quiet, &amp; strictly lawful houses -- did not in any fair construction of the Statue Keep Tippling houses but on the contrary paid for &amp; obtained their liscenes &amp; strictly complied with Bonds &amp; the requirements of the law and if any wrong has been committed it was not on their part but <hi rend="str">if any whom</hi> on the part of the trustees of said town growing out of their misunderstanding -- Therefore Your Petitioners pray a remission of the fines because no one is injured as the town &amp; State Authories have received their liscence fees -- Commonwealths attorney &amp; other officers<pb/>
<lb/>their fees and Your Petitioners have not intentionally violated the law &amp; think they have paid enough for an honest mistake make the most of the charges so alledged against them</p>
