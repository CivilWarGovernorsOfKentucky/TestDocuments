   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of the state of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your petitioner Reuben Rucker would respectfully state, that an indictment was found in the Clarke Circuit Court against his son William Rucker for forgery at the <date when="1859-11">Nov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> term of said court in the year 1859</date>. That the prosecution was set on foot out of a spirit of revenge, and for the purpose of vexation and annoyance. That the prosecution has been abandoned and the indictment filed away, but it may be called up hereafter for the purpose of annoyance, to prevent which he petitions your excellency to grant his son a pardon, so that he may be entirely relieved from future trouble and annoyance -- He does not believe that there were any grounds for the prosecution and believes that it originated in a spirit of revenge</p>
<p><date when="1861-02-04">Feb 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1861</date>
