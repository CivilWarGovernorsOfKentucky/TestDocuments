<lb/>Governor Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I was acting Commonwealth's Attorney at the <date when="1865-02">late February</date> Term of the Campbell Circuit Court. At that term James M. Southgate was convicted &amp; fined $50 for carrying concealed weapons.</p>
<p>The evidence showed that on a Sunday afternoon in June or July last, he was riding out from Newport to the place of his residence about three miles from town &amp; had fastened to the <hi rend="str">back</hi> strap of his pataloons behind &amp; under his coat a dirk knife It was noticed by some persons riding behind him &amp; by others when he took his coat off, at a tavern on the road There was some evidence tending to show that the road he was compelled to travel from Newport home was frequented by persons who were in the habit of attacking <hi rend="str">persons</hi> ^those^ passing that way.</p>
<p>Mr Southgate is a youth, a little over sixteen years of age, &amp; no harm I think would result from the exercise of Executive Clemency.</p>
<p>Very Resply,
<lb/>J. R. Hallam<pb/></p>
