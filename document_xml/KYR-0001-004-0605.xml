   <p>Danville, <date when="1864-03-08">March 8. 1864</date>.
<lb/>To his Excellency:
<lb/>The Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your Petitioner, W. B. Edelen, would respectfully state to your Excellency, that in the month of <date when="1862-12">December ^1862</date>^ <hi rend="str">last</hi>, he assumed the agency of the Phoenix Insurance Company for Boyle County. That he failed to comply with the laws of the State of Kentucky; requiring the Agents of Foreign Insurance Companies to procure license and file a statement of the condition of their company with the county clerk, before issuing policies. He states that in doing this, he acted in ignorance of the laws of the State and with no intention to violate them. That J. T. Grery, now of Frankfort, had been the Agent for Boyle County, of this company, and he having fully complied with the law, this Agent supposed in good faith, that he could issue Policies, under the license of the former Agent, until the time required to the renewal of the license procurred by the old Agent.</p>
<p>He states that the Grand Jury of Boyle County indicted him for issuing policies without license and that at the last <date when="--02">February Term</date> of the Boyle Circuit Court, he confessed a Judgment for one hundred dollars ($100) and cost.</p>
<p>He states that as soon as he was informed of the mistake and requirements of the laws of the State, he complied with them. That he had no intention, whatever, of violating the law in issuing policies without license, but supposed that he was<pb/>
<lb/>acting in accordance with them, and under the protection of the license of the former Agent until the time required for renewal.</p>
<p>He would request your Excellency in view of the facts as he has stated them, to remit so much of the fine, as the laws of the state permit your Excellency to do. All of which is respectfully submitted</p>
<p>W. B. Edelen</p>
<p>Sworn to before me

<p>I believe the Statements of the Petition are true. As Trustee of the Jury Fund of Boyle County, I ask that the fine may be remitted, and I am authorised to say that the Comth Atto also desires it may be remitted</p>
