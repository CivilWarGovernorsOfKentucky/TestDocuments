<p>Affiant John Lambourne states that he was a Police officer at the time that a man name Deiss was shot: and that He arrested Fred Wyman and that He and Stancliffe and others of the Police took Wyman and Stevens before the said Deiss, that he thought it was necessary to get his dying declaration as to which one of the men, who were charged, had shot him: He told the chief that he thought it was necessary to get some person to take them. He thinks he got Maas. The man was badly wounded and sinking from the wound and evidently in a dying condition: as affiant believed. Affiant says when Stevens and Wyman were brought before him he was asked by this affiant to point out the man who had shot him. Deis opened his eyes and pointed or looked and said it was Fred Wyman:</p>
