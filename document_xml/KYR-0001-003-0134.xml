<p>I am requested by the Board of Trustees of this place to represent to you, that the civil authority is again Striving to maintain order in the county, and thus far have succeeded; but owing to the fact that there are yet roving bands of robbers and outlaws in Counties adjoining us, who continue to rob and plunder citizens and communities, in bands of 3. 4 &amp; as hight as 18 or 20, the Board of trustees, for the purpose of better aiding the civil authority, and more effectually protecting our town and county from robbers and lawless bands, desire to raise a volunteer company of 50 men. We have in our place a local Bank, And a large number of Merchantile houses, all doing a good business, upon large stocks: And without an organization ready and competent to offer resistance at the command of the civil authority<pb/>
<lb/>we are liable at any time to be the subject of these robbers, who by a night attack may do great damage to our citizens -- ; as they meet with Success will continue to increase in number, and cause us great trouble. It is to prevent this, that our town authorities wish a company of the citizens found and organised. Their police is insufficient to prevent a raid on the town, of any number. </p>
<p>In view of these facts, they desire to know of you, whether or not they can get from the State fifty (50) guns? -- They wish short guns, Such as may be used on horse back, in case a pursuit, at any time, may be required -- They propose to Execute bond, if required for them -- and pay any charges that may be incurred on the Same. for transportation.</p>
<p>Your favorable consideration of this, will be most kindly acknowledged.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be your's with great Respect -- 
<lb/>Jno R. Ritter Lt. Col.
