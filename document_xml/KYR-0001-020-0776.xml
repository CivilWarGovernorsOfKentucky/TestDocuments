<lb/>Honorable Governor McGoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir </p>
<p>on my arrival at home I find quite a change in feelings of the the Citizens of Warren County in relation to young Jones, who has been imprisoned in the state penitentiary for four years, for Man Salughter, accused of the Killing of young Jenkins, from the best evidence; I can get it was done in heat of passion; The two boys were playmates in School, resided in the Same neighborhood were relations, they never had a quarrel before the night that Young Jenkins was Killed They were all at a Social party in the neighborhood, Young Joseph Mitchel who was a Cousin to Young Jenkins had made some threats in remarks a bout Young Jones; Jenkins being a Cousin to young Mitchel and allso a relation to young Jones; he Jenkins<pb/>
<lb/>it was thought by young Jones; that he favoured Mitchel, at or about the time that James was leaving; the party young Mitchel Came out with Young Jenkins they approached Young Jones, Young Jenkins asked Young Jones If he had anything against him, Young James replied he had not; Young Mitchel Still Urged Young Jenkins on, Mr Willson who was with Young Jones at the time, remarked to Young Jones, do not act a <unclear/>, Young Jones remarked to young Jenkins, I have allways loved you Henry as a friend &amp; Brother, but I am not a fraid of you; then Young Jenkins replied, Rufus I have allways been a friend of yours; but I am not a fraid of you, If you want any thing from me <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> now is is your time; one of the ^(Witness)^ Swears at the Same time Jenkins drew a Knife, when young Jones drew a pistole, which was supposed that Young Willson gave to him and fired,<pb/>
<lb/>Young Jones received a very Sevear wound with a Knife, Supposed to be Jenkins Knife, from the best information I can get the prosecuting party would be satsified If your Magistie would repreieve the young orphan boy that never had a fathers kind advice to warm him of the <unclear/> of this wourld and watch and protect him from its temtations Of young Jones did a wrong act at first I will tell you of Some of his after conduct. which was while in the extream; and <unclear/> deserves a reward true it was duty; but then how many of frail humanity is their but what would have embraced the first chance offering its Self and left the place of confinement, I ask you was this not noble? he never left, but remained to meet his Sentence unflinchingly after Sentence was prounaounced uppon him he was hear with out any confinement how easy would it have been for him to have left, but no he did not do this, If he in passion for got him self and committed a<pb/>
<lb/>Wrong in his Calmer moments when reason a gan resumed her throne he was far two honorable to do a mean wrong act, think you this does not <unclear/> Some reward ^as^ I am in hopes when you read the letters that will be presented to you by my friend Mr Gossum, that you will grant a reprieve for the young man, for which we plead. Their will be many a heart in the county that will bless you for the act, I think I have said enough and will now close leaving the case in your hands, permit me to tender my respects to you and your family</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Your Friend
