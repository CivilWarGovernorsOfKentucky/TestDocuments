<lb/>Joel Bekton</p>
<p>In the trial of this case I became satisfied that the lawyers in Fulton about the time of the offense complained of had propagated the idea, no doubt honestly, that a tavern keeper had a right to keep his bar room in a house detached from his tavern house &amp; Bekton tried to set up such a defense his offense was under just such a state of case -- I know nothing of the defendant or his personal merits or the general character of his tavern</p>

<p>Governor Robinson
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed I send you the petition of M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Bakton &amp; the above note of the atty for the comnwelth. I know that some of the<pb/>
<lb/>attornies in this were of the state &amp; in fact one of the prayers entertained for a while the opinion that the Tavern &amp; Gaming could be kept in different houses &amp; many persons acted accordingly, believing that such was the law, I hope under the circumstances you will remit the fine, Yours &amp;c W, N, Bradley</p>
