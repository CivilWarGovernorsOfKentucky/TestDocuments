<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed you will find the petition of Delaney Sanders for the remission of a fine of $120 imposed on him for seting his fence in the road -- Your will observe that the petition is signed by all the Jurors and the Judge who tried the indictment, which is the best evidence that we can furnish to Your Excellency of the merits of his application -- I as his attorney can only add, that I think, public Justice Does not require the enforcement of the Judgment</p>
<p>Trusting your Excellency may find it Covenient with Your sense of duty to remit the fine I have the honor</p>
<p>to be Yours &amp;c
