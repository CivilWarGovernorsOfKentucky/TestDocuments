   <p>Head-Quarters Miliary Agent,
<lb/>WESTERN DEPARTMENT.
<lb/>Louisville, Ky., <date when="1865-09-04">Sep<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> 4<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> 1865</date>.
<lb/>His Excellency,
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> E. Bramlette.
<lb/>Governor.</p>
<p>I have just completed my first monthly report which I have sent to Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Lindsey A. G. with my financial Statement, for the month of <date when="1865-08">August. 1865</date>.</p>
<p>My expenses are perhaps greater, on account of commencing in a new Office, tho,, not by one half as large as the usual expenditures I have made for Illinois. For that State my bill has run from four to six hundred dollars per month.</p>
<p>Now, there are at least 20 Ky. Soldiers to assist, where there is one Illinois man.</p>
<p>I shall aim to be as carefull in my expenditures as possible.</p>
<p>There are quite a large number of Kentucky men in hospital here: these men<pb/>
<lb/>need assistance. I shall see that they suffer for nothing, so far as it is in my power.</p>
<p>The men in Prison, I am rendering evry assistance to, that I can.</p>
<p>Just now, while so many are being mustered out, there is a constant call. for help in procurring pay, bounty, and commutations for the men, and in the correction of papers &amp;c, which involves severe labor on the part of the Agent, if properly attended to.</p>
<p>I have here the opportunity, of doing a great amount of good, whether I improve it, the men with whom I come in contact must attent.</p>
<p>I have inclosed the papers I have made in a part of the cases I have in hand for Kentucky men in Prison. I have obtained the release of thirteen of the men<pb/>
<lb/>whose cases are inclosed. I have sent these papers to your Excellency, only as a matter of curiosity, to give you some idea of the labor I am performing, and this is very small compared with the visiting hospitals, answering questions, giving advice, and straightening papers, accounts &amp;c. &amp;c. which I have to do.</p>
<p>Will your Excellency instruct me as to the amount of Salary you will allow me, and also, shall I make my bill for the same to yourself, and draw upon you for the same, or upon Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Linsdey?</p>
<p>I have ^had^ N. G. Mills before the Military Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">n</hi></hi> here, and have got his case cleared up so that I think he will receive his full pay.</p>
<p>I am Very Respectfully, Sir,
<lb/>Your Obedient Servant,
<lb/>W.DeB Morrill.
<lb/>Col.. and Mil,, Agt,, for Kentucky.</p>
