<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Gov Magoffin
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>Although declining to sign the petition presented to your Excellency yet I have yielded to the solicitation of your petitioner that I should Join with him in the prayer to your Excellency for relief.</p>
<p>I was prosecuting attorney in the case against the petition and was satisfied from the proof, that he had violated the law under which he was arraigned &amp; convicted; but I thought then and think now that he did it in ignorance and with no unlawful intention. I have known the petitioner for a long time, and can bear testimony to his respectabily, his honesty and integrity as a man -- and do hope that your Excellency may grant him the relief prayed for,<pb/>
<lb/>and are sure that no one will even have occasion to request the exercise of Executive clemency in his case.</p>
<p>respectfully, your obt servt
<lb/>Jas T Morehead</p>
