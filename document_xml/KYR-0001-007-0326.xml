<lb/>E. L. Vanwinkle Esqr Secty</p>
<p>Dear Sir I received sometime since a letter requesting me to recommend some good loyal man to act as justice of the Peace for District No 1 in the place of T. Fisher resigned I have delayed answering in order to comply but have not been abble to find the right sort of man who would accept the appointment</p>
<p>I however respectfully request that Samuel Carlisle may be commissioned as Justice of the Peace for Carrollton District No 2 in the room of B. B. Elston resgined, his loyalty and fitness are unquestioned &amp; undoubted. I would like very much for him to have his Commission in time for our Court of claims (which by Special Statue) meets next Monday the <date when="1864-12-05">5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Dec<hi rend="sup">r</hi></date> as we have only two Justices in Commission in this (Carroll) County</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>R. W. Masterson<pb/></p>
