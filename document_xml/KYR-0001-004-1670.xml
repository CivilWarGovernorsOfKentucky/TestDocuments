<p>The Indictment charged this defendant and two others with an assault with intent to kill, Separate trials were granted and Brafford was tried first, I did not think the proof justified a conviction under the indictment but asked the Jury to find defd guilty of an assault and battery -- The proof showed that he gave the man one kick the others were acquitted -- The man was cut with a knife but I am satisfied the man who did the cutting was neither one of the defendants but a man who has escaped -- it was a street brawl -- Brafford is poor the statement made in the former petition by me was Similor to this -- That was Signed by 10 of the jury</p>
