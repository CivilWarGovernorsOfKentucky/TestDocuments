<p>Dear Sir They are a vacancy in the office of Justice of the peace in the 6 District in Fleming County which was ordered to be filled at the <date when="--05">May</date> Election and from some, ^cause^ no Election was held I am requested by many of the good citizens of the district to say to you if concistant with your office not to commition anyone that is recommended untill we elect one which we will do at the <date when="--08">august</date> Election our reason for maken this request is because no one who is capable of filling the office will have it with out the voice of the people &amp; we have a very good Magistrate in the District who can attend to all the business</p>
<p>Your Truly
