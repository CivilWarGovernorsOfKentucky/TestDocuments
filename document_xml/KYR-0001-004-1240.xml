<lb/><date when="1864-10-27">October 27 1864.</date>
<lb/>Hon. T. E. Bramlette Govr. of Ky.</p>
<p>Sir. with this I send you a petition for your consideration and ask your clemency. Daniel Pickerel the person charged in the original warrant of arrest &amp; held to bail by an examining court to answer and appear in the Monroe Circuit court did as stated in the petition Join the 37<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Reg. of Infantry vols. of Ky. soon after he was held to bail and before the indictment was found and has been in the service of the U S. A. ever since The bond was forfeited in <date when="1864-04">April 1864</date> &amp; in <date when="1864-10">Oct 1864,</date> This pres.^ent^ month Judgment rendered against his sureties for the money $5000 &amp; costs of suit. The clerks of the circuit &amp; County court &amp; the sheriff of Monroe have signed the petition, I thought <hi rend="str">they</hi> as they knew the facts to get them to assign the petition officially would be sufficient undoubted testimony of the peculiarities of the matter I hope you will find it within your province to release the securities from the payment of the fifty dollars except the costs</p>
<p>Your humble &amp; obedient 
<lb/>W. S. Maney.<pb/></p>
