W. W. Sale and told him that affiant desired to go to Nashville Ten. to attend the Medical lectures<pb/>
<lb/>which would be in session during the sittin of the Court and he Sale told and promised affiant that he would for his accomodation have the case continued at that term of the court But to his utter astonishment when he returned home the Judgment of the Court was entered against him and that he had been tried agst his wish or expectation and in violation of all the promises made to him by the Commonwealths Atty. He states that upon a trial of the cause he would have been fully able to prove that under the law he had the right to carry deadly weapons, as he was able to prove that his life had been repeatedly threatened by one N. G. V. Henderson then a citizen of this County. all of which he would have been able to show to the full satisfaction of the court and Jury. but for the violation of the promises and pledges of said Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">ths</hi></hi> Atty. He states said fine or Judgement has ^not^ been attempted to be enforced until a short time ago. He states that he is very poor and has been struggling along for several years trying to make a support but that for a few years his health has entirely failed and that he has been for some time confined to his room and not able<pb/>
<lb/>to anything toward making a support and dont know that he ever will again and that it would be very hard and oppressive for him to have the money to pay. though not very large and more especially would it be unjust when it was imposed in violation of solemn promises and pledges made to him when he could upon a trial proven clearly his innocence.</p>
<p>He humbly asks of the chief Executive of the State this last and little though just request of the interposition of his Clemency in remitting said <hi rend="underline">Fine</hi> and for which he will ever pray &amp;c</p>
<p>R. J. D. Robb</p>
