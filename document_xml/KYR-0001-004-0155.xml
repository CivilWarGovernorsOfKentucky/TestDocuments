<lb/>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Bramlitte
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I have been requested by the parties interested to state you the facts of a case, in which I understand application will be made to you for remission of a fine. At the <date when="--09">last Sept<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Term</date> of the Ballard Circuit Court a fine of Two Hundred Dollars was imposed on Jo<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Canlly &amp; W. Garrett for suffering gaming in their house in Blandsville. It was proven on the trial that parties had played cards in their house at which treats of liquor, cigars, oysters &amp;c were played for and paid for by the losers and that the proprietors s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> the M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Canlley &amp; Garrett knew that said treats were played for. It was proven that the s<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Garrett &amp; M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Canlley allways forbid the playing for money and would not allow it in their house. I believe that the defendants did not believe that they were violating the law, <hi rend="str">and</hi> They are poor men with families. I believe they violated the law ignorantly.</p>
<p>Respectfully &amp;c
