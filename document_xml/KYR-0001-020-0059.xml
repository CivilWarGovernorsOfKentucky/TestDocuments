   <p>Kentucky Caldwell County.</p>
<p>Enoch Hooper and Aaron Scott state that they are the immediate neighbors of Thos B. Wadlington, and are acquainted with <hi rend="str">the</hi> him, and his general moral character, and they say that his character is that of an honest correct and peacable citizen. They say they are also acquainted with the deceased Cartwright, and they regard him as a violent and dangerous young man, and such was his general character. They say they are also acquainted with the witnesses Prince and Blalock, and from their knowledge of them and their conduct in relation to said trial they are well satisfied, that they did not present the truth on the trial, and that the most flagrant injustice has been done said Wadlington by the verdict of the Jury. and they believe that the said Prince and Blalock are not entitled to credit as witnesses in a court of Justice They say they believe, that the killing of Cartwright was in necessary self defence.</p>
