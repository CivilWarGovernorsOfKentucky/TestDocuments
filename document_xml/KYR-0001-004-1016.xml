   <p>To his Excellency, Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Tho. E. Bramlette,</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Simpson Co Ky, would respectfully represent, that one Anthony Speelman was fined by the county court Judge of this county, the sum of one hundred Dollars for unlawful Peddling -- They State that Speelman is quite a youth, perhaps not exceeding Sixteen years of age, and they feel satisfied that the youth was not conscious of committing the offence he did commit -- That he thought a United States License, which he had, protected him -- and ^gave him authority to Peddle, without state License,^ They state that his profits in pedling were very Small, that his entire stock on hands consisted of ^a^ Trunk full of china Ware, &amp; fancy Notions; we think the above case is worthy of executive clemency, and hope that you will remit the whole of Said fine, except the costs and that portion, to which the County attorney is entitled -- </p>
