<lb/>Gov. Magoffin, Frankfort, Kentucky.
<lb/>Judge Frazier, " "

<lb/>Judge Duvall, Georgetown, Kentucky.
<lb/>Hon. Wm. E. Simms, Paris, Kentucky.

<lb/>Dear Governor:</p>
<p>Herewith I hand you the Petition of Mrs. Margaret Clarke praying for the pardon of her husband. The Petition was handed to Governor Magoffin so soon after his conviction, that, although it was signed by a large number of the best citizens of Marion County, including nearly all the jurors, and several officers of the Court, he did not feel inclined to extend his clemency to him at that time.</p>
<p>Permit me to add that Mrs. Clarke &amp; her 7 children have lived in Frankfort ever since Mr. Clarke's confinement -- The family followed him here, &amp; have lived all the time in sight of the prison walls, so that they might be able to administer as much as possible to his comfort in his confinement. They have clung to him with a fondness worthy of a better fate.</p>
<p>I will add that the family has been reduced to extreme poverty -- two of the daughters are about grown, and I honestly fear that shame and poverty may shortly induce them to stray from the paths of rectitude.</p>
<p>Hoping that your Excellency will do what you can to save these girls from such calamity as I have intimated, by restoring their father to them I remain,</p>
<p>Your friend, John L. Scott.</p>
