<lb/>Hon Thos E Bramlette.
<lb/>Governor</p>
<p>Enclosed I send you a letter from Judge Harbeson in reference to a fine imposed against one of my clients at the last term of our city Court. While other of my clients were as heavily as fined I cannot and do<hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> not ask for the interposition of Executive clemency. But in this case where the proof was that the house was kept so orderly I am constrained to ask for a remission -- As long as time is their character of houses will Exist, and it seems that for those who keep quiet and orderly<pb/>
<lb/>the fine should be proportionately small; as an inducement to them to keep their houses that they may not be a scandal to the neighbors and a disgrace to the city.</p>
<p>I could send a petition to this effect; but am satisfied that the judges letter will be as effective as could be any petition</p>
<p>I am Sir Yours &amp;c
