   <p>To His Excellency Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Jacob Elderkin states that at the <gap/> -- term of the city court of Louisville he was held to bail in the sum of $200,0 to appear and answer to an Indictment in said court for an assault &amp; battery. He failed to appear, and two cases were tried -- in one case he was fined five hundred dollars &amp; in the other case he was fined one hundred dollars. A Sci fa. was sued out against him on his forfeited bond, and a Judgment was had against him on the same for two hundred dollars, at the <date when="1860-11">November term of said court (1860)</date>. Before the Judgment was rendered against on ^the^ Sci fa, he had replivied the said two fines <hi rend="str">amounting in all to</hi> the the costs in the two cases amounting to two hundred and thirty three dollars &amp; 70 cents, which he has paid. After the said fines were imposed upon him he appeared, and replivied as above stated. He thinks it a Great hardship on him to have to pay said two hundred dollars, when the same was only to secure his appearance, all of which he did, and the commonwealth has lost nothing, he having performed the Judgment of the Court. The costs in this case amount to about $75, which he will be compelled, to pay -- and he is not able now to pay ever that much, but will be compelled to spare at times portions of his daily earnings, for the payment of the costs. He earnestly appeals to your Excellency, to remit this penalty believing that Justice will have been done if the same be remitted.</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Jacob Elderkin</p>
<p>Louisville <date when="1861-02-11">Feb 11th 1861</date> -- </p>
<p>The facts set forth in the fgoregoing petition are true &amp; we Join in the foregoing petition for a remission</p>
