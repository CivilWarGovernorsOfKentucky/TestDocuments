<lb/>His Excellency Governor Bramlette:
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I enclose you a copy of a verdict in the case of the Commonwealth against Joseph Gaston, recommending him to the clemency of your Excellency -- The prisoner is a boy about 14 years old and one of the handsomest best-looking boys you ever saw. The articles he was found guilty of having stolen were an old copper boiler and brass kettle of very little value. I was appointed by the Court to defend him, he having no friends and no money, and being a stranger, a resident of Salem, Indiana. If it should please you to pardon him I shall endeavor to send him back<pb/>
<lb/>to his widowed mother in Indiana </p>
<p>If your Excellency should decide to pardon my young client, will you please send the requisite papers before Saturday, which is the last day of Court -- </p>
<p>I am, Sir,
<lb/>very respectfully yours,
<lb/><hi rend="underline">James S. Pirtle</hi></p>
<p>I find that a copy of the verdict has been sent you by Col. Harney with a petition for the pardon of Seymour Edwards, a little black boy who was jointly indicted with Gaston. I defended both parties, but Col Harney had been employed for the negro boy but was unable to be present at the trial -- </p>
<p>very truly
<lb/>James S. Pirtle.</p>
  </body>
