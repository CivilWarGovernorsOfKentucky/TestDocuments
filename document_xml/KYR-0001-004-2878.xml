   <p><figure type="seal"><ab>CITY OF LOUISVILLE
<lb/>PROGRESS
<lb/>KENTUCKY</ab></figure></p>
<p>Mayor's Office,
<lb/>Louisville, Ky., <date when="1865-12-02">Decr 2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> 1865</date>.
<lb/>His Excy Thomas E. Bramlette Governor of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>I avail myself of a seat the Mayor's Table to address you a line on business -- A young man whose name is G. W. Cornell was tried <hi rend="underline">jointly</hi> with one Cannon and one Watson for breaking and robbing the Store of Jones &amp; Lapp of this City and sentenced to seven years in the Penitentiary -- The finding of the Jury against <hi rend="underline">Cornell</hi> surprised every one present, and Judge Muir Passed the sentence upon <hi rend="underline">him</hi> reluctantly -- His Honor stated from the Bench that of the attorney would prepare a petition for pardon that he would join in the Prayers -- This was said with much feeling -- </p>
<p>So great was the horror of this young man at the idea of the Penitentiary, that he jumped from the Cars and made his escape, at the imminent risk of his life, while <hi rend="str">while</hi> being conveyed to Frankfort by Sheriff<pb/>
<lb/>Ronald &amp; Posse -- He has never been retaken and is still at large -- </p>
<p>All of us who know the facts of this case believe that Cornell was an innocent man; but had been found in bad Company -- He has had a terrible lesson -- one that he will never forget.</p>
<p>Now, Governor, the <hi rend="underline">Mother</hi> of this youth, who is a most excellent woman, through me, intercedes with your Excellency, to grant your official Pardon to her unfortunate son -- I wish I had the influence to make her prayer in this behalf prevalent -- </p>
<p>Her Petition will be Presented to you by William Ray Esqr. a worthy gentleman, and formerly Chief of Police of this City -- I hope you ^will^ grant a pardon and thus relieve the aching heart of an Anxious Parent -- </p>
<p>Most respectfully
<lb/>Your friend and obedient servant
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Ro. F. Baird.</hi></p>
