<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E Bramlette
<lb/>Gov of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Gov</p>
<p>There was a forfeiture at the last term of the Garrard Circuit Court against Richard Lutrell for $500- I have been so frequently <hi rend="str">been</hi> consulted in this case by individuals in whom I have the utmost confidence that I am induced to ask your leniency on the subject. Mr. Lutrell at one time by industry and economy had accumulated a little property which is<pb/></p>
<p>now all gone. He is said to be still honest and industrious but has his widowed sister and her orphan children to support which is about all he can do and with dificulty can do that, I have released two thirds of my own fee. And feel satisfied he ought to be relieved</p>
<p>If you prefer a petition in addition to this he will have no dificulty in obtaining one. Living in the country I have never seen him since the forfeiture or I would have required it <unclear/></p>
<p>Yr friend
