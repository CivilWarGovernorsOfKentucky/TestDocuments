   <p>Ashland Boyd County Ky <date when="1865-07-28">July 28/65</date>
<lb/>To his Excellency T E Bramlette
<lb/>Gov of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner, Edward Courtney, would most respectfully state that at the last <date when="--04">April term</date> of the Boyd County Circuit Court, he was fined fifty Dollars, for selling spiritous Liquors to a minor. (by the name of Bery Singer) Your petitioner admits that he did sell spiritous Liquors to said Singer, but at the time he sold the Liquor he asked him if he was twenty one years old, that the said Singer told him that he had enlisted in the Army of the U. S, at eighteen years old, and that he had served three years and over in the Army. Under that statement he let him have the drink of Liquor thinking that it was all right, but the Jury thought otherwise, your petitioner would therefore pray your exelency to remit the fine,</p>
<p>Edward Courtney</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Boyd County, believing that Mr Courtney did not intend to violate the law at the time that he sold the Liquor to above named singer; and that his a law abiding Citizen we would petion your Exelency to remit the fine against him</p>
