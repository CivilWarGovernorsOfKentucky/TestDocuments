   <p>Dear father!</p>
<p>It has been so long ago,, since I have written to you that I feel nearly ashamed of myself. Very often have I thought of you so, but believed it to be unnecessary to ask you to do anything in my behalf, because Mr Richway told me that he had spoken to you in regard to me and says, that you had refused, to do anything in my favor. I could hardly believe it then, but now I determined to ask you boldly, at the same time begging pardon for all the past follies which I have comitted, faithfully promising to lead a different life herafter. In case you should feel inclined, to take the proper steps to get me pardoned, I in return pledge<pb/>
<lb/>you my word of honor that I shall join the Federal Army and there I will regain the character, which I had lost;</p>
<p>With sorrow and trouble have I caused but in the future it shall be my main desire to sweeten your old days, and wipe away the stain, wich our family has received, diretly through me</p>
<p>By sending my love to all sisters and relatives</p>
<p>I remain patiently awaiting an answer</p>
<p>Your obedient
<lb/>Son Charles Stephens.</p>
