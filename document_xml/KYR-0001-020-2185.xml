   <p>To His Excellency The Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your memorialist Adam Benther a citizen of Louisville would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1860-03">March Term 1860</date> of the City Court of Louisville he was fined the sum of Fifty Dollars and cost for an alledged assault made upon one Protas Nutton. The case had been continued on the Docket until the cost amounted to Nine <hi rend="sup">40/100</hi> Dollars exclusive of the attorneys portion of the fine. The party assaulted is a member of a cabinet maker Society with your Petitioner, who provoked the assault and was not seriously hurt, only receiving a slight scratch on the hand -- Your Petitioner represents further that he viewed the matter in so trivial a light that he did not attend to the case and moreover paid to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Nutto Eight Dollars and a half for the injury he sustained and made friends with him -- The fine is an exorbitant one, so much so that it will be oppressive to your Petitioner to pay the same, as he is poor and a man of family, and a working Mechanic<pb/>
<lb/>and the vindication of the law does not call for oppression upon the citizen.</p>
<p>In view of all the facts in this case he respectfully prays a remission of that portion of said fine belonging to the Commonwealth. He has with great inconvenience to himself and family paid all the cost in the case</p>
<p>And will ever pray &amp;c
<lb/>A Benther</p>
<p>The undersigned respectfully recommend that ^the^ prayer of the foregoing Petition be granted, believing that the case is a meritorious one -- </p>
<p>John <hi rend="underline">M. Stokes &amp; Son</hi></p>
