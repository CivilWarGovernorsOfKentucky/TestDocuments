   <p>Mt. Sterling, Ky. <date when="1864-08-19">August 19th ^'64^</date>
<lb/>To His Ex. Gov. Bramlette</p>
<p>At the last Term of the Montgomery Circuit Court there was a judgment, by confession against Jas. H. Cromwell for setting up a Faro Bank, for $500 -- There was another indictment against a M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Miller -- a person of transcient habitation in this community -- for the same offence, but who left before process was executed upon him, &amp; has not been heard from since so as to take him. About Miller's guilt in the matter there is no doubt. Cromwell confesses that together with a number of other of our best citizens, he at different times took a hand in the game, &amp; may have conducted it sometimes. He believed that he could prove himself clear of the setting up, but did not choose to involve himself &amp; these other citizens in the notoriety of a trial, &amp; therefore allowed judgment to go against him, &amp; depending upon your Excellency's clemency to remit the fine &amp; the disabilities connected with it, which ^was^ told him, under the circumstances, he might reasonably hope for.</p>
<p>Mr Cromwell is a resident here &amp; man of family &amp; not therefore of the class of men who <hi rend="str">come here &amp; set</hi><pb/>
<lb/>roam over the country like "birds of passages." He is a <hi rend="underline">gentleman</hi>, a <hi rend="underline">good citizen</hi> &amp; a <hi rend="underline">man of character</hi>.</p>
