   <p>The undersigned Citizens of Warren County Ky most respectfully beg leave to offer a few suggestians to His Excellency Gov Magoffin why Rufus Jones convicted of Manslaughter for Killing Henry Jenkins should not be pardoned, In the first place it is useless to have laws unless they are executed. The great evil of our day is that all laws and obligations moral and legal are relaxed. In the 2' place there is nothing in this case certainly not in the testimony to show that Jones has got any more punishment than his case demanded Indeed It is almost the universal opinion that he got off very well with four years imprisonment and he ought to be Glad of that and so far as we know his friends have not Complained of the Jury for finding that lenght of time in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> place If Jones is pardoned we dont see why the whole lot of prisoners in the prison at Frankfort may not be turnd out on the same principal, In the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> place If Jones is discharged It will amount to a general invitation to all violations of the law to repeal their offence, and the disrged of the law will not be met while then we do not go into any specific perconal charge we basely say that the Gover -- ant read a copy of the tistimony befor the examing court or on final trial<pb/>
<lb/>and Say on his oath on conscience that Jones ought to be discharged
