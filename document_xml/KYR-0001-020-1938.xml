<lb/>My dear Governor,</p>
<p>Judge Whitaker will present you with an application from the jury, the witnesses and some of the citizens in favor of the pardon of David Douglass, convicted at the present term of the Mason Circuit Court of <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>manslaughter. Douglass was a weak, inoffensive man when sober, and almost entirely sensless when drunk, The act for which he was convicted was committed under the influence of deep intoxication, and considering all the circumstances, I think his case one for the interposition of executive clemency; I, therefore, unite with the jury and other citizens in asking that he may be pardoned,</p>
<p>Very respectfully,
<lb/>R H Stanton
<lb/>Atty for Comwlth</p>
<p>Hon B. Magoffin, Governor &amp;c,</p>
  </body>
