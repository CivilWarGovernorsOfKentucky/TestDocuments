   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>The Governor of Ky -- </p>
<p>We the undersigned Citizens of Sharpsburg and vicinity. would most respectfully represent to your Honor that we are very much annoyed for the want of the proper means to carry out or to Execute the <hi rend="underline">Civil</hi> <hi rend="underline">Law</hi>. That there is a number of persons here who bid defiance to the civil authoritys and when they cannot defeat it themselves, they get the assistance of the <hi rend="underline">Military</hi> to help them. For instance a case that occurred on Friday the <date when="1864-01-01">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> day Jan 1864</date>. Where the Officer by virtue of an Execution in his hands, had levied on property to make Said debt and had the property in his possession. But along came Lieut Col Clark with a part of the 45<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Reg. and when applied to by the defendant in Execution, the Officer sent a <hi rend="underline">posse</hi> of his men and made the Civil Officer surrender up the property thereby preventing him from making the debt. Therefore we hope your <hi rend="underline">Excellency</hi> will grant such relief in the premises as will hereafter enable our Civil officers to do their duty and that they may not be interferred with by the Military again.</p>
