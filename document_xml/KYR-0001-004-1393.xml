   <p>His Excellency Gov
<lb/>Thos E Bramlette,
<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>At the present <date when="1864-12">December Term 1864,</date> David Whitehouse -- was convicted under two indictments -- for selling liquor to two minors -- one John Cure -- the other C. Sandford -- On the trial of Cure -- defendant produced and served by the Father of John Cure -- that in the year <date when="1862">1862</date> -- he had given Dr Whitehouse a written authority to sell his sons Ferdinand and John whatever they wanted. Whitehouse kept a Tavern and would not permit the boys to drink liquor without the order -- which the father gave -- The Judge construed the law that there must be written authority for <hi rend="underline">every</hi> sale -- that a <hi rend="underline">general</hi> authority would not shield the defendant and therefore he was fined -- and immediately repleived the debt -- </p>
<p>Precisely the same state of facts extended as to C. Sandford under the same circumstances he was fined $50 -- in each case -- the undersigned John F. Fisk defendant -- and the undersigned J. R Hallam prosecuted as Commonwealth ProTem -- We think this a fair case for Executive Clemency -- Evidently the Sandford and both the parents did what they thought was a compliance with the law</p>
<p>John F, Fisk</p>
<p>I make no recommendation but the facts are correctly set out in the above</p>
