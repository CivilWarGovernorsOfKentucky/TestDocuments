<lb/>To his Excellency

<lb/>Dear sir</p>
<p>I write this at the request of the anxious Mother of the young man D W Clark who is now in the state penitentiary for the span of four years he was sent for three years for taking one of my horses. I live in Covington I found this horse in Cincinnati. he had not attempted to sell said horse as he had been there some time and if he has behaved himself well since he was there if you can exercise your clemency as regard his case<pb/>
<lb/>you will confer a favor on his anxious mother who feels sorely bereaved about the conduct of her son</p>
<p>he worked for me some three years before the occurence then he was a pretty good boy think that since that time he must of got in to bad company and been led off to do the deed he did do you had better see the young man and converse with him yourself his mother is a good and honest Lady that has seen better day I wish your Excellency <hi rend="str">you</hi> would pay some attention to the prayer of the Mother and grant her request if it is possible for you to do so</p>
<p>Yours Respectfully
<lb/>Jas C Fay</p>
