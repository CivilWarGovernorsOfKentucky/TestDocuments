<p>He states that last Summer he was at a Barbicue in this county where a man was retailing spirits under an Arbor &amp; he having to be absent employed this petitioner to sell for him until he returned, which he did, selling probably half a Dozen drinks.</p>
<p>At the time he did it he was not apprised that it was in violation of any law, seeing the man there selling he supposed he had a right so to do.</p>
<p>He states that he is poor &amp; not able to pay said fine without oppressing himself &amp; family.</p>
<p>He therefore asks to be returned of the same.</p>
