<lb/>To His Excellency Gov Magoffin-</p>
<p>About two weeks ago a petition for the benefit of Samuel L Lewis, signed by some of the most respectable men in our city (all signing who were asked), was put into your hands. Your Excellency declined to act upon it until a Jury should try the causes. Yesterday the cases were heard- the testimony corroborating the statements in the petition. The jury without delay acquitted him of any breach of the peace but fined him $50 for carrying a concealed weapon. The pistol was broken, but the Judge ruled that the facts proven did not bring him within either of the exceptions of the statute. This ruling, tho perhaps technically correct, worked manifest impostive in this case: and this act is not within the true spirit of the statute.</p>
<p>I recommended this prayer to your Excel-<pb/>
<lb/>lency upon the statements of Mr Lewis; I now more recommend it upon the testimony given in the trial.</p>
<p>Mr Lewis is connected with one of the most respectable families in our county &amp; is a young man of good character.</p>
<p>I respectfully submit the case to your Excellency with the confident belief that your Excellency will think the costs more than adequate punishment for a mere <hi rend="underline">technical</hi> offense, and will grant a full pardon for the remainder of the fine.</p>
<p>With great respect I am
<lb/>Your Excellency's
<lb/>Ob'dt Serv't
