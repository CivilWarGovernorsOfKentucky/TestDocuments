   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Ky.</p>
<p>Your petioner Ewing Forth would respectfully represent unto your Excellency that on the <date when="1864-02-11">11<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of Feby 1864</date> he took out license to retail spirituous as Hotel Keeper in Hart County for twelve months -- and afterward obtained from the Collecter of internal revenue a license from the U. S. Gov<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. which license expired on the <date when="1865-05-01">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> day of May 1865</date> -- He had no copy of the order of the Hart County Court granting him the license, and was misled by the date of his Government License, and therefore failed to renew his state license at the time it expired -- </p>
<p>Under this state of case the Grand Jury of the <hi rend="str">Jul</hi> <date when="1865-04">April Term 1865</date> of the Hart Circuit Court found an Indictment against him for Keeping a Tipling House -- and on examining the records of the County Court and finding his license had expired he confessed judgment on Said Indictment -- In-as-much as his violation of the law was from a misapprehension and from no desire to evade the payment of the taxes to the state -- He asks that your Excellency remit the fine ($60.) save fees &amp; costs.</p>
<p>Ewing Forth<pb/></p>
<p>The Government License of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Forth as "Retail Liquor Dealer" at Hardyville in Hart County Kentucky, are now before me and expire <date when="1865-05-01">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> May 1865.</date> I have no doubt but that he labored under a misapprehension in failing to renew his state license</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Ja</hi><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi><hi rend="underline">., A, Dawson</hi></p>
<p>We the undersigned state that we Know the petitioner M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ewing Forth, and that he is entitled to full credit -- we are confident that he labored under a mistake in failing to renew his state License, and unite in the petition for a remission of the fine.</p>
