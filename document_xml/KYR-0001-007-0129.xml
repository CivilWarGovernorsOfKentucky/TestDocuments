<lb/>To
<lb/>Hon. T. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Frankfort Ky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I saw paragraph in our City paper stating that you had offered to Genl. Boyle the appointment of Kentucky Claim Agent at Washington D. C.</p>
<p>I saw another paragraph on yesterday stating that Genl Boyle had declined accepting it.</p>
<p>I write to say to you that if you have not made an appointment yet and are not committed to any one and will so inform me I would like to be further informed as to details of the duties etc etc of the office with view of performing its duties if you should appoint me.</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>C. H. Barkley</p>
<p>I have been engaged in Gov<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Claim business for several years and can satisfy you as to qualifications, etc.</p>
<p>C H Barkley</p>
<p>Governor,</p>
<p>I have known Mr Barkley, as an industrious and laborious man, devoted to his business as agt<pb/>
<lb/>for collection of claims against the Government. He is one of the few men I know in whose christianity I have confidence. He stands at the head of his profession as a Lawyer &amp;<hi rend="sup">c</hi>. If the place is not filled, I am confident his appointment will never be regretted by you, while it will be blest by those whose intrest are committed to his care.</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>J M Hewett
