   <p>To the Honorable
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your Petitioner would most respectfully represent that at the present <date when="--06">June</date> Term of the Fayette Circuit Court he was tried upon four several indictments for giving or selling liquor to a slave upon which he was fined in the sum of Fifty Dollars; upon the charge of <gap/><hi rend="str">&amp;c</hi>He was tried and fined in the sum of Fifty Dollars; upon the charge of keeping a disordrly house he was fined in the sum of One Hundred Dollars and upon the charge of keeping a tippling house he was fined in the sum of One Hundred Dollars. He would most respectfully represent that he has not been a wilful violator of the laws of the state, but that these violations have grown out a combination of unfriendly persons and perhaps to a considerable extent out of his ignorance. He desires to be a law-abiding and good citizen rather to support and defend the laws of his state and government than to infringe in<pb/>
<lb/>the least.</p>
<p>He further represents that he is a poor man who is wholly and solely dependant upon his daily labor for the support of himself and his family and if compelled to pay the fines inflicted herein would have to be confined to jail for the same and his family must certainly suffer. And no view of these times ^of pecuniary^ trouble He prays at your Excellency's hands a remission of said fines thus imposed against him except fees and costs and he will ever pray &amp;c -- </p>
<p>Wm ^his X mark^ Lamphier -- </p>
<p>Attest
<lb/>Jas. C. Morris -- </p>
<p>We, the undersigned would recommend the remission of the above fines except fees &amp; costs -- </p>
