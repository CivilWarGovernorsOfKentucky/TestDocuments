   <p>Louisville Ky <date when="1861-12-05">Dec 5<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> 1861</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Govenor of the Commonwealth of Ky.</p>
<p>Your petitioner Lucinda Barnum would respectfully state, that in the early part of <date when="1861-09">Sept 1861</date> in the City of Louisville State of Ky in the Police Court she was fined the sum of Two hundred dollars ($200) The charges against <hi rend="str">th</hi>your petitioner were for keeping a disorderly house. She states that at the time of her trial she was sick and in bed and had been for some days previous, and through her ill health she was kept in bed for some days after the trial. That at the time of the trial not being present, and having no one to represent her, it was spoken and so represented to the Jury "that she has abandoned the state" which was false, and that such false charge went to her prejudice, as she is informed, so charges and believes to be true. She says the fine was unjust, excessive, and that she is wholy unable to pay it, that her health is bad -- and if forced to go to the work house would doubtless end in her death. She says the costs of the case, and the fee of the Atty for the Com. will be as much or more than she can pay -- She therefore asks that your excellency will pardon the fine -- and she will ever pray &amp;c</p>
<p>Lucinda Barnum says she believes the foregoing petition is correct to the best of her knowledge.</p>
<p>Lucinda Barnum<pb/></p>
<p>The undersigned <hi rend="str">state</hi>say ^that^ they have read the petition of Luncinda Barnum and know the statements made in said petition are correct</p>
