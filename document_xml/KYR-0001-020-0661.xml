<lb/>Hon B. Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir. </p>
<p>Robert Horton Esq of the County of Carter was at the present Term of Rowan Circuit Court fined 50$ under an Indictment charging him with having carried a pistol consealed. The proof showed that a five minutes before the time he was seen with the pistol he borrowed it for the occasion from a friend, he then being in the pressence of a person who as he belived had thetined him with violency of whom he was then apprehensive I am very Sure that this is a proper case for Executive clemency, and therefore recommend and Solicit your Excellency to remit so much of this fine as under the Law. you are authorized to remit</p>

<p>I agree with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Andrews in the above statement, which is the substance of the testimony, and think the fine ought to be remitted, and recommend it.</p>
