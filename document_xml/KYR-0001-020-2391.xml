   <p>Commonwealth of Kentucky,
<lb/>OFFICE SECRETARY OF STATE,
<lb/>Frankfort,
<lb/>Dear <hi rend="str">Sir</hi> Governor</p>
<p>I know all about this case and think it presents strong claims for Executive Clemency Mr Hart is quite a poor young man, tho' as clever as any can be and of as good family as there is in the state <hi rend="underline">being</hi> <hi rend="underline">a relation of Mrs Magoffin</hi> Blacks brother married Harts sister &amp; it was in that way he was induced to go security -- Blacks offences being only misdemeanors, &amp; punishable by fines -- being for selling whisky to slaves -- He has left the state for the States good, &amp; if he should return he can be taken up &amp; tried, the <hi rend="str">judgments</hi> indictments standing against him still -- No good can be done by making Mr Hart pay the fine, &amp; hope you will release him of as much of the fine as you</p>
<p>Truly Your friend
<lb/>Grant Green<pb/></p>
<p>Grant Green
<lb/>for Hart -- </p>
