   <p>State of Kentucky
<lb/>Casey Circuit Court} SS <date when="1864-05">May Term 1864</date></p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Kentucky Plaintiff
<lb/>against } Upon Indictment &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>
<lb/>M Thomas Defendant</p>
<p>This day appeared the attorney for the Commonwealth and the Summon having been duly executed on the Defendant and he having failed to Answer the Indictment herein -- It is adjudged by the Court that the Defendant make good his fine with the Commonwealth by the Payment of Nineteen dollars the fine for the offence charged in the Indictment; and that the commonwealth recovers against her Costs herein expended</p>
<p>Attest Joel Sweeney Clk C C C</p>
<p>His Excellency Tho E Bramlette Governor of Ky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Martin Thomas Sen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> most respectfully represents that the Grand Jury for Casey County Ky found an Indictment against one "<hi rend="underline">Morning</hi> <hi rend="underline">Thomas</hi>," for standing &amp; <unclear>stalling</unclear> to mares his Stud horse without first having obtained a Licence. the Summon executed on your petitioner as being the person indicted and at the <date when="1864-05">May term 1864</date> of the Casey Circuit Court Judgment was rendered on said Indictment for Nineteen Dollars fine &amp; costs by Default upon said Judgment an execution issued &amp; is now in the hands of the sheriff of Casey County for Collection <unclear><hi rend="str">and</hi></unclear>who has demanded of me payment on the ground I suppose that I have ^or had^ an old stud horse (of the Thomas family) in Casey County at the ^time the^ Indictment was made (<date when="1863-05">May term 1863</date>) there being no other Thomas having a stud horse the initials of whose name agrees as well with the person indicted as Mine, I am being identified as the Thomas who was indicted and it may be true the jurors struck at me and failed to give my true &amp; full name: (I know of no Thomas whose name is Morning in the County)<pb/>
<lb/>In consequence of ill health of myself &amp; Family and my <unclear>frail</unclear>leness of body I made no defence to the indictment &amp; knowing myself innocent of the offence charged I could not believe any man living could or would make good the charge -- as before said, I had a stud Horse about 20 Years of age used by me as a work beast on my Farm and in the Spring of the year <date when="1863">1863</date>, some of my friends &amp; neighbours petitioned me to let him to their mares which I did demanding no price nor receiving any pay for said horses Services, doing it to gratify the fancy ^&amp; whim^ of My neighbour &amp; friends -- the foregoing statements are true</p>
<p>Now to quiet further proceedings in this matter whether I am held up as the offender or not, the promises considered <hi rend="str">you</hi> I ask at your hands, should my cause merit it; an entire remission of the fine aforesaid or <hi rend="str">with</hi> such <hi rend="str">all</hi> relief as you in your clemency may think proper to grant. will be thankfully received by your friend and Humble Servant.</p>
<p>Martin Thomas</p>
<p>Subscribed &amp; sworn to before me this <date when="1864-08-01">1 day of Augt 1864</date></p>
<p>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> B Cundiff J P c c</p>
<p>From my acquaintance with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thomas I believe his Statements to be true and think his prayer should be granted by paying the Costs</p>
