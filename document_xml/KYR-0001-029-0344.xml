   <p>Frankfort Ky.
<lb/><date when="1863-05-31">May 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi> 1863</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency,
<lb/>James F. Robinson,
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>
<p>I am your state prisoner; having been confined in the penitentiary since the <date when="1859-12-02">2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> day of December 1859</date>, being three years and nearly six months, under sentence of five years; having lain in jail eight months and twenty-one days, making the aggregate of my confinement four years, two months, and nineteen days.</p>
<p>I am advised that my friends have made an effort to induce your Excellency to mitigate my condition: and that they are now in possession of the conditions upon which I have learned your Excellency expressed a willingness to exercise the Executive clemency in my behalf.</p>
<p>I suffer, my friends suffer. I believe that a desire to inflict unnecessary pain exists neither with the people or their Chief magistrate, the Governor. If it should seem consistent with the public good to extend to me the Executive clemency -- to bestow upon my my pardon, I shall receive it with inexpressible gratitude, and endeavor to live at peace with all people, mind my own business, and try to wipe off the stain as far as possible from my name, by industry, quiet, obedience to law, -- laying up something for the future years of a faithful young wife, who suffers as I suffer -- joining no army, exciting no disaffection, -- being entirely neutral, -- being "<hi rend="underline">obedient</hi> to the powers that be,"<pb/></p>
<p>I hope for pardon if this impertunity shall seem impertinent; and desire that your Excellency may be pleased to allow me to hope to enjoy your favorable consideration and to subscribe</p>
<p>Your penitent prisoner
<lb/>Victor Phillips</p>
