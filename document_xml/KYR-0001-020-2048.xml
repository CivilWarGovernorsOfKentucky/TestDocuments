<lb/>Dear Governor</p>
<p>Enclosed find a petition numerously signed urging you to remit the old fine against Mr A T Ferguson, I was one of his counsel, &amp; thought at the time, he was merely fined because they intended to punish all, He took no part in it except as stated in the petition, &amp; I think he was almost bound to do that, The others who did all the mischief are all released, He is wholly unable to pay, &amp; to force his mother who is my nearest neighbour, &amp; really estimable Lady to do so, is very hard after such a lapse of time &amp; under such circumstance, I hope you will remit it</p>
<p>Your truly
