   <p>Elizaville <date when="1861-01-25">Jan 25th 1861</date>
<lb/>Mr F Mongar.
<lb/>Dr Sir</p>
<p>Some time in <date when="1859-02">February 1859</date> I Executed a writ issued from the Fleming circuit Court upon a charge of misemeanor ^against Wm. S. Flora^ <hi rend="str">He</hi> afterwards he told me he was not the man the case was not called the first court -- after which I saw Mr Flora &amp; Told him it was not called. at the next regular court I watched for the case to be called. but it was not called. &amp; I Supposed it had been lost Sight of it Seems that the matter was taken up at the <date when="--07">last July term</date> at which time. The case had become old I paid no attention to it &amp; Judgement went against him by defalt I have no doubt Flora thought the case was past &amp; forgotten. in fact I thought so myself. it woul be a pity for him to have to pay a fine if not guilty &amp; I have no doubt <hi rend="str">but</hi> he thought his telling me he was not the man would do. &amp; if The matter had been called in court. when it was fresh in my mind I would have <hi rend="str">had</hi> asked for a continuance. by Stating that Flora was labouring under the impression That it was not nesscessary for him to attend becaus he had told me he was not the man. I am willing to Sign a petition embracing in Substance what I have here written</p>
<p>Yours Respectfully
<lb/>D. J Eckman</p>
