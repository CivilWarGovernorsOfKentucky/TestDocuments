   <p>E L Van Winkle says that he was present when the bond was given by the petitioner and his recollection is ^it was argued^ that no forfeiture was to be taken against them if they procured the certificate mentioned in the petition he states that they did obtain the certificate of their Captain Brent Fishback that they were good soldiers &amp; were doing service as such this was signed in affiants presence &amp; sent to Judge Fox or shown him as he learned &amp; the cases continue the first term &amp; he was surprised when he afterward learned that forfeiture had been taken at the fall term.</p>
