   <p>Lebanon Ky <date when="1860-12-29">Dec 29. 1860</date>
<lb/>His Excall'y Gov Magoffin 
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the <date when="1858-10">Oct. term ^1858^</date> of the Jefferson Circuit Court Presly Ashby was tried upon an indictment for the murder of George Gossage. &amp; upon said trial was convicted and sentenced to a term of ten years in the Ky penitentiary</p>
<p>Peter B Muir was then &amp; is now Judge of that Court, but having been employed as Counsel for the accused, could not set as Judge on the trial of the case, And I was appointed by the bar Juge pro temp during the trial of this case &amp; so acted</p>
<p>I have been requested by the friends of Ashby to join in a Petition to you for his Pardon.</p>
<p>I do so most cheerfully for the following reason A Young son of Ashby whose first name I do not now recollect was introduced as a witness on the Part of the defense; he was a most important witness for the defence, if a competent witness at all he having been present at the time of the Killing<pb/>
<lb/>and ready to give a version of what occurred at the time materially different from that given by the witnesses for the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>As was my duty I conversed freely with the boy &amp; examined him as I thought thoroughly with a view to ascertain his capacity to testify before a jury; I came to the conclusion then, and cannot say to the contrary now that he was not competent to testify before the Jury; however upon much &amp; earnest reflection upon the Subject Since, I have come to the conclusion that the ends of Justice would have been better Subserved, &amp; the real facts of the case been better attained if I had permitted the testimony of the Young Ashby to have gone to the Jury &amp; permitted the Jury to have judged of his capacity and veracity in giving his testimony in the case; And that I had determined if application had been made to me for a new trial, I would have granted it for the reason above set forth, &amp; permitted that testimony to have gone to the Jury.</p>
<p>It will afford me much pleasure if upon a full view of all the facts which will be<pb/>
<lb/>presented to you by his friends You can feel yourself justified in extending to Mr Ashby your Executive clemency.</p>
<p>Very Respy yr most
<lb/>obdt. Servant
