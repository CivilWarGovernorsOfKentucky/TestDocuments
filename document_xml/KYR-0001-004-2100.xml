   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thomas. E. Bramlette, Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your Petitioners Temple Haynes and David T. Clark, would respectfully represent, that at the <date when="1865-07">July Term 1865</date>, of the Pulaski Circuit Court, a Judgment was rendered against them for $100, for failing to appear at said Court to answer a charge of the breach of the peace -- Your Petitioner Clark being security for Temple Haynes on his bond -- They state, that they thought the whole matter was fully settled up between them and one Tunstal Q Hamilton who sued out the warrent against Haynes -- That Hamilton had consented &amp; agreed to not prosecute the matter further, being satisfied that the warrant was wrongfully sued out -- For this reason they did not appear at said court -- </p>
<p>They further state, that Haynes was arrested &amp; delivered to Col Eve, then Commanding at Point Burnside in this County, who to whose presence the whole difficulty was amicably settled -- </p>
<p>Your Petitioners ask that the fine against them be released, as it is a hardship to have it to pay under all the circumstances -- </p>
<p>xTemple Haynes<pb/></p>
<p>We concur in the statements of the above &amp; foregoing petition, and ask your Excelency to remit the fine</p>
