<lb/>Gov J. F. Robinson</p>
<p>Important business called me here but I am now ready and most willing to serve my bleeding Country in any position you may assigne me. but as a work of charity would prefer the command of the Cavalry lately under the command of Col. Metcalf as I feel Great confidence that I could very soon make them useful and as I have personal knowledge of verry many of the officers and men and know them to be Good material I am most willing to make an untiring effort to reclaim them but if I cannot have that command I would be<pb/>
<lb/>most happy to be commissioned by you to raise one thousand men in the Counties of Fleming Lewis Bath Rowan Morgan and Carter for three months service to drive out the Robbers who have possession of my house and property and are now devastating <hi rend="str">and</hi> that Country -- Gov I pray you not to consider mine as a verry common appeal to you when I inform you that I Got up the expeditions of Nelson and Garfield and as an independent volunteer went with them receiving no pay and out of Scanty means having my own expenses and in the same way at the head of home Guards have for twelve months been<pb/>
<lb/>actively defending my Country -- At a portion of the history of my family permit me to say That an Uncle of mine was killed in Harrods' defeat, two near my Grandfather Herod's Station in Clarke County Ky are at Fort Megs and one at the River Razin and a Brother at Fort Megs my Father was a pioneer of Kintucky Seven years before the Indians were driven out and with 30 men brought on the engagement under Genl Wayne at the Rappids in "94 I am almost the last of the family and do not wish to survive the Government of our Fathers and therefore<pb/>
<lb/>most earnestly ask of you some situation in which I can serve my Country</p>
<p>As to myself permit me to refere you to the letter of Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. Nelson to Hon J. J. Crittenden James Guthrie George D. Prentiss Garrett Davis Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. L. Combs Henry S. Lane Senator of Indiana W H. Wadsworth and Martin P. Marshall</p>
<p>I shall most anxiously await an answer at Maysville Ky</p>
<p>Most Sincerely
<lb/>Yours
