   <p>Covington <date when="1863-08-05">Augst 5 1863</date>.
<lb/>To His Excedllency J F Robinson:
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>As Mayor of the City of Covington, I issued to C W Roback a License under the Ordinance of the City of Covington, to peddle his Bitters. This was upon the <gap/> day of <gap/> <date when="1863">1863</date> and the License was for a period of six months. When he applied to me for a License he told me the "bitters" would be brought over in ^a^ waggon by his Agent or driver and asked me if the License should be issued in the name of the Agent or driver. I told him that I should issue it in his name, that he should endorse upon it the name of his driver or Agent who should carry with him the License which<pb/>
<lb/>would be sufficient under the City ordi^n^ance. I understand that the driver was arrested and tried before Esqr Eggleston who decided that the City License was not available as a defence because it was not issued in the name of the driver. I am satisfied my construction of the City Ordinance was correct and believe that Mr Roback offers a good reason for the Executive clemency. Very Respectfully</p>
<p>Yours
<lb/>C A Preston Mayor C, C</p>
<p>P, S, It is my impression that the Justice of the Peace who tried the case had no Jurisdiction</p>
<p>C A Preston Mayor C, C,<pb/></p>
<p>Statement of the Mayor of the City.</p>
