<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Governor Robinson</persName><lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>As attorney for the Commonwealth I prosecuted one  in the upon a charge of Manslaughter, Savage was convicted &amp; sentenced to 10 years Confinement in the Penitentiary. He has now served out about one half of the time. I now write for the purpose of inducing you to pardon him and release him from the balance of the judgement of the Court. I feel impelled to this course from a concientious regard from the just administration of the law. The conduct of the deceased at the time he was slain was such as no man could have refrained from violence and altho technacally quilty of manslaughter Savage has already dearly &amp; fully in my judgement expiated the crime. <persName ref="cwgk:N00004837">James Savage</persName><orgName ref="cwgk:O00000584">Wayne Circuit Court </orgName> informs me that he has already furnished you with a statement containing the substance of the testimony I therefore refrain from a repetition. And join him in an earnest appeal to you to let the poor fellow out. He was always a good boy honest and industrious, and stood well when the unfortunate affair occurred which has cost him his liberty.<persName ref="cwgk:N00004834">Senator Buster</persName></p>
<p>I am yours Truly
