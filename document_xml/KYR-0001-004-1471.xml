<lb/>Governor Bramlette</p>
<p>Dear Sir -- I defended young Davenport at his trial, and did it without fee or hope of reward -- He was but a harmless youth, had served three years in the Army of the U. S. and was about to re-enlist as a veteran Soldier -- There was no malice either general or special in the act and he was filled with grief inexpressible when ^he^ ascertained that he had, unwittingly, done mischief -- He did every thing in his power to remedy the evil he had done as soon as he found the party was hurt -- No life was lost; and I think, if you will permit me to suggest, that it was precisely such a case as the Constitution contemplates for the benefit of pardon -- I hope you will grant an immediate pardon -- </p>
<p>Most respectfully
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Robert, F. Baird</hi></p>
