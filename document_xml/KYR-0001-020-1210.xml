  <body>
   <p>To His Excellency Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. of Kentucky
<lb/>Respected Sir</p>
<p>Your petitioner Dennis C. Kelly would state That he is Bail for his brother P E Kelly in the sum of six hundred doll<hi rend="sup">s</hi> for his appearance in the circuit court of Jefferson County -- which Bail bond was forfeited by the non appearance of s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> P E Kelly at the May Term of s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Court. Your Excellency granted a respite for 12 months which has not expired. Your petitioner is now informed that his brother is in the army of the southern con<hi rend="str">viction</hi>federacy enlisted during the war as a soldier &amp; there is no prospect of his return for some time Your petitioner has a wife &amp; five children to support all the children too young to work or to be of much service he is without a trade &amp; has a house &amp; lot now of no great value but is still a home, to pay this would entirely ruin him &amp; place it out of his power to render the assistance to his family, they so much need<pb/>
<lb/>If y<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Excellency in view of these facts could possibly remit the penal bond, over which you have Executive control you would save a helpless family from ruin &amp; in no <unclear>win</unclear> injure the state over which you preside with so much merited ability with the greatest respect yr obt servt</p>
<p>D. C. Kelly</p>
<p>I know Mr Kelly to be an industrious sober &amp; correct man I believe his statement correct &amp; therefore join in the prayer to remit his bond</p>
<p>very respectfully y<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Excellencies obt serv<hi rend="sup">t</hi></p>
<p>John Joyes</p>
