   <p>To Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E Bramlett Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Alanson Trigg respetfully represents to your Excellency, that he has been indicted &amp; fined in the Warren Equity &amp; Criminal Court for permitting as was alledged two negro men slaves to go at large &amp; to hire themselves as will more fully &amp; at large appear from copies of the Indictment &amp; judgment herewith filed &amp; presented as part hereof. Your Petitioner conceives that he has been persecuted &amp; badly treated in this proceeding He could not owing to the condition of the County well bring these negroes from Warren to Barren County, in ^which^ your petitioner resides. <hi rend="str">Both</hi> ^Each^ of them had <hi rend="str">wives</hi> ^a wife^ in Warren County near a farm owned by this Petitioner for many years &amp; on which he had kept his slaves. On selling his farm he did not want to sell his slaves &amp; allowed them to remain in Warren out of humanity. But he placed them in the care &amp; control of John Petty and W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> G Hendrick who promised to take care of &amp; manage them as their own &amp; if the law has been violated your Petitioner says others &amp; not he violated it. Your Petitioner avers that there are not better behaved &amp; more honest slaves any where to be found than the two mentioned in the Indictment &amp; he humbly asks your Excellency to remit the fine imposed upon him</p>

<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> A Trigg was not at the last term of the Equity &amp; Criminal Court of Warren County when the within mentioned Indictment was tried As attorney I defended him. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Petty &amp; Mr Hendrick were witnesses &amp; in substance stated that the slaves had been put under their control by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Trigg that is one of the slaves under the control of Mr Petty &amp; the other under the control of Mr Hendrick The jury I thought ought not to have convicted &amp; I request that the Governor will remit the fine</p>

<p>We unite in the above request</p>

<lb/>R C Logan</p>
<p>The negroes spoken of in the Petition are old men- &amp; have been of little or no use to Mr Trigg for years. I presume the Indictments originated from the ill feeling of some of the neighbors for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Trigg -- The same privileges are given many other negroes in the town &amp; country=I therefore join the this Petition</p>
