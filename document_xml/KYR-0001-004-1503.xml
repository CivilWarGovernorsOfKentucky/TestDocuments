   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>Tho E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governer of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your petitioner, John Morgan, respectfully shows, that at the <date when="1865-02">February Term 1865,</date> of the Boyle Circuit Court, he was indicted for violating the <hi rend="underline">Gaming laws</hi>,</p>
<p>Hearing that he was indicted by the Grand Jury, he went voluntarily, without summons, before the Court, and confessed a judgment for the penalty, $500. Of this sum he paid to the Comlths atto<hi rend="sup">y</hi> that part of the fine going to him, and to the Clerk his fees.</p>
<p>He admitted by the confession of judgment his quilt, but, for the verry short time he was engaged in play, and the fact too that he was importuned by old friends and acquaintances to engage in it, he has already paid a sufficient penalty. He regrets much this violation of the law, and hopes to find in the mercy &amp; kindness of the executors of the law, an abundant reason for a more careful observance of it hereafter.</p>
<p>He therefore respectfully prays y<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Excellency to remit the said fine, and in duty bound will ever pray &amp; -- </p>
<p>John Morgan<pb/></p>
<p>The undersigned, Citizen of Danville, know the Petitioner John Morgan well, and we respectfully unite with him in asking the Governer to remit his fine. <date when="1865-02-23">23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Feby 1865</date></p>
