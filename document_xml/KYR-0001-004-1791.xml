<lb/>Jefferson County Sct</p>
<p>William. H. Gaslin states that on the <date when="1865-08-05">5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of August 1864</date> He was solicited by one Baldwin whom he knew to become the Security of his brother M. E. Baldwin in the city court of Louisville on a bond for Four Hundred Dollars that Said M. E. Baldwin should appear before the Jefferson circuit court at its next term to answer a charge of Felony -- On the representation made to him as to Said M. E. Baldwin being innocent of the offence, affiant consented and entered into Said bond for the appearance of M. E. Baldwin at Said circuit Court and at the Calling of the Cause at the <date when="1864-10">October term of the Jefferson circuit Court for 1864</date> affiant together with Said M. E. Baldwin appeared before Said Court and Said M. E. Baldwin then and there announced to the court that he was ready for trial, and affiant fully believing that he was free from all responsibility left the Court House under the impression that Said Baldwin was about to be tried on the charge=Affiant did not again see Said M. E. Baldwin, and Some days afterwards was informed that Said Baldwin was not tried and that the recognizace or bond entered into by Said Baldwin and this affiant as Said Baldwins Security had been forfeited=affiant has no knowledge of<pb/>
<lb/>what occured after he left the court House on the day the case was called as aforesaid, but is informed that the court ordered a Continuance of the case and gave M. E. Baldwin permission to leave the court house in order to procure security to become bound for his appearance at next term -- and that said Baldwin never returned -- </p>
<p>affiant States further that he would have been unwilling if applied to to become farther bound as Said Baldwins security -- affiant makes this affidavit for the purpose of enabling him to obtain a remission of the penalty of Said recognizance for which Judgment has been rendered by said Jefferson circuit court -- </p>
