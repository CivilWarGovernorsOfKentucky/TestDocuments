   <p>Montgomery County
<lb/>State of Kentucky } SS:</p>
<p>J. A. Dawson being duly sworn says he is the Sheriff of Powel County; and is a Union Man. That some time since an unfortunate &amp; fatal affray occurred in his County between a number of men on each side. That one man by the name of Hall was killed by those of the other side, to wit: Hezekiah Bowen &amp; three sons and one Wilbourne</p>
<p>Instead of these men being comitted and kept in Jail they were bailed out by W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Bowen of said County of Powel, and a <hi rend="underline">Brother</hi> of the Father Bowen in the sum of $500. Each. That all of them have appeared except Wilbourne, at each Court except one, and have always seemed anxious for a Trial. That it was supposed for some time, and so reported that said Wilbourne had Joined the Union Army: but this now seems to have been false. And there is little doubt but what said Wilbourne is either living or dead within the so-called Confederate lines. The Recognizance as to him has been forfeited but not tried. As to the non-appearance of the others at one Court, the Bail claim they have sufficient defence to induce the Court to remit the whole of it on trial. Mr W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Bowen is one of the most respectable &amp; law abiding citizens in the county. He has paid some considerable <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> lately as Security for others.</p>
