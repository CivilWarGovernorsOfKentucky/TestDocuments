<lb/>To His Exellency Gov Robinson
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Please permit me to call your attention to the following case Mr F. C. Jenkins of our county, was indited in our court Some time ago and judgment obtained against him for perhaps about $200. Mr Jenkins sent on a Petition for the release of the fine and Gov Magoffin granted him a respit for 12 months -- which time is now out -- I refer you to the Petition of Mr Jenkins, as to the facts of the case -- Mr Jenkins is a poor man, and it would go very hard with him to have this fine to pay -- he will have to pay to the Attorney about $60 &amp; all the costs and knowng him as I do to be a worthy gentleman I must recommend him to mercy -- I hope on examination of the case you will be able to release the fine Your friend </p>
<p>B. Spalding</p>
