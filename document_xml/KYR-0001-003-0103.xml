<lb/>Office Kenty State. Agency.
<lb/>Washington. D. C.
<lb/><date when="1865-04-05">April. 5" 1865</date>.
<lb/>His Excelency,
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramlette.
<lb/>My Dear Sir,</p>
<p>In your letter of <date when="1865-03-29">29" ult</date> in reply to mine of <date when="--03-20">March 20<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi></date>, asking your views, &amp; instructions for carrying into effect the 9" section of the act of <date when="--02-27">27" Feby</date>, amenditory of the ^act^ establishing and defining the duties of this office:</p>
<p>You state "I understand from the qr. mr Genl that no abstracts are necessary, beyond those sent from his office, and that all the evidence required has to be gotten up here, (in Frankfort) and not in Washington, that they are working at it now, there will, therefore, be no necessity for the services contemplated by the 9<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> section &amp;c -- " This statement of the qr. Mr. Genl of the state, appears some what strange. -- On the <date when="1864-12-15">15" day of Dec 1864</date>, I wrote to the qr. Mr. Genl informing him of<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">2</note>
<lb/>this fact, and enclosing him such information as I had received from the 3" auditor of the Treasury on that subject.</p>
<p>I enclose you a copy of my letter to him marked "A" and refer you for copies of ^the^ letter refered to, to those, exibited in my report to you of <date when="1865-01-01">January. 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> 1865</date>, these letters contained the substance of all the information. I had on the subject, except that the clerk in charge of the settlement of State accounts informed ^me,^ that the accounts with the State of Kentucky would not be examined, until it was properly prepaired -- These facts were contained in my report of <date when="1865-01-01">Jany. 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> 1865</date>; You will find herewith extract relating to that subject.</p>
<p>Immediately on the receipt of your letter of <date when="--03-29">March 29<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">"</hi></hi></date>. I, again addressed a note to the 3" auditor of the Treasury, on this subject, a copy of which Marked "B" with his reply marked ".C." are herewith enclosed for your information -- </p>
<p>I have no other interest in this matter than a faithfull discharge of my official duties, and I deem it to be the major part thereof to<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">3</note>
<lb/>keep you fully advised of a matter of so much importance to the State as the settlement of an open account involving the sum of $2.246.400.73 --. Upon this there has been <hi rend="underline">advanced</hi> $1.051.000 -- but not one paper has been examined, nor has any portion of the account been passed ^upon^ by the accounting officers of the Treasury. The only reasons, I can give for this are contained in the auditors letters filed with my report of Jany. 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi>, and <hi rend="str">are</hi> herewith enclosed.</p>
<p>I urged this matter upon your Earnest consideration in my January report, an extract whereof is herewith enclosed marked ".D." and I now again earnestly call Your attention to it -- This account should be settled. the qr. Mr. Genl informed you that the account is properly prepaired for examination; the auditor advises me that it is not -- I have given You all the information I have, and all that I have derived from official sources, which will enable you to determine what is best to be done in the premises.</p>
<p>I have been thus specific in my statements on this subject, as I regard it of<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">4</note>
<lb/>the gravest importance; it should claim Your most earnest attention. -- I have carefully avoided any statement that is not bassed upon official information.</p>
<p>If I have not fully met public expectation upon the subject of this settlement, I hope the reasons here given, and explanation here made, will be accepted as my justification.</p>
<p>I cannot do this work without the aid of the appropriation contained in the 9" section of the act, unless I totaly neglect the current business, of my office</p>
<p>I respectfully request a thorough examination of this subject by Your Excellency.</p>
<p>I am Sir very respectfully
<lb/>Yours. Obt. Servt.
<lb/>C D Pennebaker
<lb/>Agt State of Ky.
