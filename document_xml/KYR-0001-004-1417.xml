   <p>To his Excellency Govenor Bramlette</p>
<p>Your Petitioners would respectfully represent that Albert, G, Gaitskill was fined at the last term of the Bourbon Circuit Court for keeping a tipling house, Mr Gaitskill is a Tavern Keeper in the Village of North-Middletown and was so at the time he was charged with keeping a tipling house, and had regularly procured tavern licese.</p>
<p>The facts are these, he rented an old tavern stand in said village, to which there was a bar room attached, and which was then in possession of another individual, who refused to give it up, there being a misunderstanding between the owner of the said tavern and him; under the circumstances he rented temporarily a room across the street, detached from his lot and house and kept bar therein, and for so doing he was fined under the instructions of the Court.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">We</hi>, the neighbors of Mr Gaitskill ask that his fine may be remitted, we believe if he violated the law, he did it ignorantly, believing he was authorized by his license to retail; He has kept an orderly, decent, respectable tavern, and is a man of industry, sobriety and moral worth, we further state that as soon as he could get possession of his own room he removed his bar room into it.</p>
