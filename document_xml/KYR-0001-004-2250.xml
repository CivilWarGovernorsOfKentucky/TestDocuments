  <body>
   <p>To his Excellency Gov. Thomas E. Bramlette
<lb/>Gov. of the State of Ky.</p>
<p>Your petitioner Wm. Ramsey Sr. Says, that in <date when="1862-01">January 1862</date>, his son Wm Ramsy Jr., a youth in his 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year was indicted Jointly, ^by the Jefferson Circuit court^ with one Josiah Eaton on a charge of horse Stealing. At the <hi rend="str">first</hi> ^Same^ term, after the indictment was returned, his Son <hi rend="str">was</hi> ^having been^ arrested, the case was continued by the Commonwealth, and your petitioner, became bail for his Son's appearance at the next term of Said court in the Sum of $1000.</p>
<p>In a short time afterwards, and before the next term of Said Court, his Son entered the army of the U. S. as a volunteer, where he has been ever Since, in the Service of his country. He has been in the Army under Gens. Banks, &amp; Canby &amp;, and has Seen much hard Service; and has made a good and faithful Soldier.</p>
<p>He has not been at home Since he entered the Service; and at no time, or term of the Court, Since the bond or recognizance was given, has it been in the power of your petitioner to have him at Court to answer -- because of his absence from here in the army as af'<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.<pb/></p>
<p>A forfeiture of Said bond has been taken against him, and unless your excellency remit it he will have to pay the full sum of $1000. &amp; the costs of Suit.</p>
<p>Your petitioner is an old man now, and in moderate circumstances, has worked and Struggled hard to raise a large family, So that they might be respected and respectable; and by reference to the accompanying petition it will be Seen he has Succeeded. Not a Staine, or word of reproach has ever been uttered against himself or any member of his family, until this charge against his youngest child and Son. The only evidence implicating him in the affair, is that the Stolen horse was found in his possession. But Eaton who Stole the horse Said he Sold him the horse (See affidavit of Saml R Stucker) Your ^petitioner^ <hi rend="str">son</hi> does not believe his Son is guilty; or that he could be convicted; and did not run him off to prevent a trial. But he entered the army without his Knowledge <hi rend="str">or</hi> <hi rend="str">consent</hi>; and Since, it has been impossible for him to bring him up for trial.</p>
<p>But, even if I could have brought ^him^ to court for trial, -- ought I, as a father to have done so? I love my child and I love my country. I faced the cannon's mouth, and the <hi rend="str">lead</hi> leden hail on<pb/>
<lb/>the plains of Mexico; and my Son has done much more in the South -- he has braved death, on many a bloody field, in defense of your State &amp; your people as well as mine. And now, as a man, who <hi rend="str">for</hi> ^through a life of^ nearly Sixty years, has endeavored faithfully, to discharge his duty to his fellowman, his country, and his God, I appeal to your excellency to relieve me of the payment of the entire Sum of this bond; and to pardon the alledged offense of my Son.</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>William Ramsey. ^Sr^</p>
<p>The undersigned petitioners, would respectfully and Specially recommend this above as a case in which executive clemency Should be interposed in behalf of the petitioner.</p>
