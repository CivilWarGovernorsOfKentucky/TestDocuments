<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>There will be presented to you for your examination and Consideration a copy of the Record from the Caldwell Circuit Court in the Case of the Commonwealth against Thomas Wadlington Convicted of Murder, and also a petition for his pardon. I was one of his Counsel and feel Confident in my own mind that he was improperly and illegally Convicted. That he was not guilty of murder, in slaying Cartwright, and let him have erred every so much, he was not guilty as charged. There was an certain destitution of proof of Malice express &amp; the Malice implied by the killing was rebutted by the proof and Circumstances in the Case, and I think if there could be a Case Justifying the interposition of the Executive the Case of Wadlington is that case. I am not in the habit of asking the interposition of the Governor to prevent the Carrying out the Judgments of the Courts. but in the Case under Consdieration. I should be doing violence to my Convictions of what is Justice if I failed to ask you to Consider and grant the prayer of the petitioners for his pardon</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/><hi rend="underline">M. Mayes</hi></p>
