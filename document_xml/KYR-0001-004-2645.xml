<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Govr Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Wm Spencer <hi rend="str">who</hi> was convicted of grand Larceny at the last Term of the Kenton Circuit Court, The facts developed on the trial were that he was a stranger here having boarded at the house only a few days &amp; that he stole a pair of pants from a fellow boarder -- Spencer has friends in New York of means and respectability and I am assured by a gentleman upon whose<pb/>
<lb/>Statements I confidently rely that this is his first offence and from the Statement of the Rev W P Jermane he is repentant &amp; Mr Areson his uncle assures me that he will take him to N York &amp; put him into business &amp; and do all in his power to reform him. Spencer is young only twenty years old; and upon all the facts of the case and Surrounding it I can earnestly ask your Excellency to pardon him</p>
<p>Very Sincerly
<lb/>Your friend
<lb/>R B Carpenter
