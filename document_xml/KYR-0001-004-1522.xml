<lb/>Gov Thomas. E. Bramlette,
<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>Hoping that by acquainting You with my presant condition you may be moved to extinnate your Executive Clemency in my behalf.</p>
<p>I have therefore procured permission from the Keeper of this institution to write to you on the subject </p>
<p>I was tried and convicted at the <date when="1863-10">October term of the Grant County Court in the Year 1863.</date> I was intited on two charges the first for assisting in the escape of slaves for which I got a centence for two years in the Penitentiary the Second was for stealing a horse for which received a centence of four years in the Penitentiary. The law proved me guilty. and therefore it will profit me nothing to plead innocence at present. I certainly did go as fare as the Ohio river with parties who I suppose were guilty of the offence. But as for myself there was no inducement whatever to influence me to take a part in the act. </p>
<p>And what I did do I did it ignorant of the anormity of the Crime. But suppose I am guilty -- God knows, and I feel that I have suffered Sufficiently already to attone for the offence. My helth is very bad -- I am subject to fits and have been ever Since I was very young -- but within the last six months I have been worse than ever I was before. I have a fit now every<pb/>
<lb/>day and they are groing more severe every day. My flesh is wasting away -- and I fear I have not long to live -- And Oh God -- how awful twould be to die in this place. My Relations live in Ten and do not know of my misfortune, and if they did I fear they would not be able to help me. I have a little Daughter in Ohio who kneeds what little I can do for her.</p>
<p>For particulars of my present condition I refer you to Dr. Pythian, and the Keeper of this institution For particulars as to my trial I will refer you to Mr W. R. Rankin of Williamstown Grant Co.</p>
<p>Hoping that you may be Sufficiently interested in my case as to make such inquires as may justify you in signing my release I subscribe myself</p>
<p>Respectfully Yours,
<lb/>Nancy White.</p>
<p>Pardon &amp; send to H. I. Todd</p>
