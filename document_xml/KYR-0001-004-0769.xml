<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Tho E. Bramlette,
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Mrs Elizabeth Dunn visits Frankfort for the purpose of seeing her son, who is a convict in the penitentiary, &amp; of appealing to you in his behalf. W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Dunn, his son, is a private in the 34<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Infantry, &amp; served for some time in it, but as I understand, he got drunk in Louisville, played cards, with a negro for a watch, &amp; won its, &amp; the negro refusing to give it up, he knocked him down &amp; took it away from him, was indicted &amp; tried in the Jefferson Circuit Court on a charge of robbery &amp; convicted.</p>
<p>His mother is old, &amp; resides here, though the family are refugees from Middle Tennessee, driven from home on account of this devotion to the Union. W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Dunn served for about two years in some regiment not recollected by his mother, &amp; then joined the 34<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky. with his father, who is now 55 years old. I hope you Excellency<pb/>
<lb/>will give his case some consideration &amp; that you may find it consistent with your sense of duty to pardon him &amp; restore him to his regiment. He can do his country more good fighting for it, then in the penitentiary, if the facts are as represented, I think he is already sufficiently punished.</p>
<p>I saw him when I was in Frankfort &amp; he does not look to me like a bad man, &amp; if you had time to see him yourself, I think he would impress you favorably. I know your time is very much employed, but hope you may spare enough to make happy the heart of this old lady, consistently with your views of official duty.</p>
<p>I need not state, that I have no personal knowledge of the facts of his case,</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Your Truly
<lb/>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Sampson<pb/></p>
<p>Jefferson Cir Ct
<lb/>vs
<lb/>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Dunn</p>
<p>Issue Pardon specifically that it is upon consideration that he immediately rejoins his Regiment and continues to serve his time faithfully therein</p>
