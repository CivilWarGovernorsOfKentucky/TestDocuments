   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>James F, Robinson -- Gov. of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your, Petitioner, R. D. Langen, would respectfully state that he was indicted at<hi rend="str">at</hi> the <gap/> sitting of the Grand Jury for the City court of Louisville <hi rend="str">of</hi> for the offense of carrying concealed a pistol, and at the <date when="1863-01">January Term 1863</date> of said court he was fined fifty dollars. He states that he was carrying the pistol it is true, at the time of his arrest, but he was passing from his boarding house to his place of business, That he did not feel himself safe without some weapon of defence, That it was very early in the morning before it was fairly light, That roberies and murders are so frequent that no citizen is safe in going about the city at night especially in some localities without some-thing whereby to defend himself, That he injured no one with the pistol nor did he attempt to injure or hurt any one, That there was nothing attached to the case to aggravate it. <pb/>
<lb/>but the fine was simply for the carrying concealed. That it would work a great hardship at this time to enforce the law rigorously That these are times especially in Louisville for the intervention of the Governor in such cases and for the extention of the Clemency of your Excellency in the remission of fines of This kind He would further state that he is ^in^ a poor condition to pay the fine That his means are very limited.</p>
<p>The above facts are respectfully ^submitted^ to your Excellency with a prayer that you may remit his fine.</p>

<p><milestone unit="column" n="1"/>We the undersigned citizens and officers of the City Court of Louisville, would state that we know the Petitioner to be a sober honest and industrious citizen and one worthy <hi rend="underline">of</hi> <hi rend="underline">executive</hi> <hi rend="underline">clemency</hi></p>
<p><milestone unit="column" n="2"/><cb n="1"/>The Petitioner is a young man of industrious habits &amp; poor. Considering the circumstances attending the case &amp; the General <hi rend="str">rise of</hi> necessity for self defense against lawless persons recently in our city, I recommend the petitioner as asked by him</p>

<p>I do not recollect the facts proved in the case referred too in the within Petition, but I do know that many persons have been assaulted without cause by Lawless persons in the city &amp; that recently a number of robberies have been committed,, and such is the danger from this class of persons that are at present in the city that I believe a majority of our citizens go around for self defense. The Petitioner is a very worthy Industrious young man &amp; poor</p>
