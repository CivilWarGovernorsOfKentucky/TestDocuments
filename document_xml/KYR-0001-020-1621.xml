<p>Dr Sir. The above is a correct copy of a Judgement rendered at this term of the court, which I feel constrained to ask your Excellency to remit.</p>
<p>The deft was recognized to appear at the <date when="--10">October</date> Term as a witness in a misdemeanor case. He appeared at the opening of the Court but learning that the deft, his neighbor, was sick and could not attend, and supposing the case could not be tried in his ^(Defts)^ absence, he left the Court House &amp; went home -- The case was not tried on a/c of the absence of Deft witnesses. Seabold was called <hi rend="str">up</hi>and failing to appear his bond was forfeited -- He is a poor, honest &amp; upright young farmer; but very ignorant of legal procedure, He has heretofore attended punctually at the call of the case, and <pb/>
<lb/>his absence upon this occasion was the result of ignorance and not design. The collection of this judgment will greatly distress, and impoverish his family. And I hope your Excellency has sufficient confidence in me to believe that I would not appeal to you in a case that was not meritorious.</p>
<p>Hoping that you will remit this judgment
