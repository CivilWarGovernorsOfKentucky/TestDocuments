   <p>To His Excellency Gov Robinson</p>
<p>The enclosed letter is from the sons of an old Citizen who died in this county a few years since</p>
<p>I volunteered to defend him at Williamstown &amp; finding he had been caught in bad company &amp; had offered to pass Counterfeit money I advised him to confess which he did</p>
<p>I was satisfied that a man who was in company with him &amp; who had been acquitted was the real rascal but there was no means of proving the fact -- The fellow was a shrewd sharp rascal &amp; had in my opinion put forward Herndon to pass the Bank notes which he furnished him with</p>
<p>He has been pretty severely punished by the service rendered the state</p>
<p>I have an impression that I wrote out the facts which came out on the trial &amp; afterwards leading me to the belief of his having been a mere instrument in the hands of the others &amp; that the statement was filed in the secy office I cannot now recall the facts but will see about my conclusion -- If consistent with the public good I will be glad<pb/>
<lb/>to see the poor being have a chance for reformation</p>
<p>I will recollect at the trial that he was in a miserable state of health from having been a hard drinker</p>
<p>Resply
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Tho N Lindsey</hi></p>
<p>T N Lindsey pettn for pardon of Harndon</p>
<p>See no sufficient ground</p>
