  <body>
   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>The petition of the Subscribers, Citizens of Washington County respectfully Showeth;</p>
<p>That one Richard B Yocum a citizen of Washington County Stands charged on indictment before the Washington Circuit Court for the offence of murder committed on the person of one H C Miller on or about the <gap/> day of <date when="1862-11">Nov 1862</date> of which offence the following is the Item statement, as understood in this community H. C. Miller from the commencement of the Rebellion has been a violent Secessionist and taken a very active part as Such and withal had been a very bad man having killed as many as three men during his life time.</p>
<p>While Gen'l Buell's army was passing through Kentucky, and to the date of his death he occupied and busied himself with arresting Furloughed Soldiers and paroling them, pretending to be a confederate officer, making himself a great terror to Union Soldiers visiting their homes</p>
<p>Richard B Yocum, was a private in Company D. 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Vol Infy and visiting his home in Washington County at the time on a sick leave</p>
<p>Said Yocum in Company with one or two other Soldiers of the 4th Ky Vol Infy as we are informed, were visiting a neighbors house<pb/>
<lb/>when the aforesaid H C Miller came and demanded their Surrender, Saying that he had forty men near at hand, and that he would kill the last one of them if they refused to comply with his terms, and further more that he intended to drive every d-d Union Soldier from the county. Upon these Soldiers refusing to surrender a difficulty ensued and Yocum shot and killed Miller. Said Miller had always been a very bad man, and busied himself making threats against Union Soldiers, driving them away from their homes. Richard B. Yocum was a good Soldier was honorably discharged from the United States Service in <date when="--12">December last</date> by reason of expiration of term of service and is now living at his home in Washington County, a peaceable and quiet citizen and wishes so to continue. While doing service in the army he received a severe wound in his left hand, and is now a pensioner on the United States pension list. He is a very poor man and unable to bear the expense of a protracted and tedious trial to establish his guilt or innocence. We would therefore respectfully and earnestly pray that he be pardoned of the offence charged against him</p>
<p>and Your petitioners will
<lb/>Ever pray &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">co</hi></hi><pb/>
