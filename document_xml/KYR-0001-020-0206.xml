   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>The Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>May it please your Excellency</p>
<p>A poor woman came to me this morning, stating that her son John Maginty was fined, a few days ago, in one hundred dollars for some difficutly with a fellow laborer -- she also stated, that she paid five dollars to a lawyer, who <hi rend="underline">never</hi> <hi rend="underline">appeared</hi> at all the trial; but that this same lawyer came to her demanding five other dollars which if he got, he promised to send a petition to your Excellency in behalf of her son -- the poor woman was not able to raise this extra amount, and as I know the poor woman and and her family, and that her son is her principal support -- I have taken the liberty to intercede with your Excellency in her behalf -- her son is now away from home fearing to return; Hoping that your Excellency may remit the fine, is the sincere wish of your humble petitioner</p>
