Your Petitioner is informed that his said slaves have wives in <placeName ref="cwgk:P001020">Warren County</placeName> where your Petitioner once owned &amp; carried on a farm, which he sold a few years ago. After the sale your Petitioner thro humanity to his slaves &amp; in order that they might remain convenient to their wives hired <persName ref="cwgk:N00004940">Jerry</persName> to <persName ref="cwgk:N00004977">John Petty</persName> &amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N00004941">Beverly</persName> to <gap/> <persName ref="cwgk:N00004979">Hendricks</persName> notes were regularly given for the hire of ^said^ slaves until <date when="1862">1862</date> &amp; <date when="1863">the present year</date> &amp; for these years he was informed by correspondence &amp; messages that said Petty &amp; Hendrick would keep the slaves on hire as they thertofore had done The troubles growing out of the situation of the Country &amp; other causes created great difficulties in the management of slave property &amp; your Petitioner readily relied on the information he received that said Petty &amp; Hendrick would keep the slaves as above stated &amp; your Petitioner did not go to Warren to see about the matter. Your Petitioner<pb/>
<lb/>states positively that it never was his intention to violate the law &amp; to allow his slaves to hire their own time &amp; to go at large &amp; hire themselves to others &amp; had he been able to attend the trial &amp; give information to the lawyer who defended him he believe the jury would not have found as they did. Under the circumstances he prays your Excellency to remit the fines. In testimony of which he hath hereto set his name this <date when="1863-09-26">26th of September 1863</date></p>
