   <p>STATE OF VERMONT.<figure type="hr"/>
<lb/>BY FREDERICK HOLBROOK,
<lb/>GOVERNOR.<figure type="hr"/>
<lb/>A PROCLAMATION.<figure type="hr"/></p>
<p>UNTIL the coming of the blessed Kingdom when "the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them," human life, whether individual or collective, must be a conflict, and its achievements the result of the toils, trials, fortitude and faith. The discipline of adversity, rather than the softer influences of prosperity, gives character and power to a people. As the most precious odors exhale their choicest fragrance when incensed or crushed, so a people, chastened by adversity, develop their finer and nobler qualities, acquire fortitude to bear with lofty cheer the trials by which themselves and their institutions are proved, and energy to surmount difficulties and triumph over evil. It was through dangers and difficulties that our fathers first made a lodgment on the shores of New England, and amid discouragements, privations and sorrows which would have overwhelmed the spirits and shaken the faith of the other men, that they instituted and observed a day of Public Thanksgiving and Praise.</p>
<p>Under far more favorable circumstances to us, the season of the year and the custom honored by time and sanctioned by religion, call for a day of Thanksgiving. In obedience thereto, and that we may give united expression to our gratitude, I do appoint THURSDAY, THE <date when="1861-11-28">TWENTY-EIGHTH OF NOVEMBER</date>, instant, to be observed by the people of this State as a day of THANKSGIVING TO ALMIGHTY GOD; and I invite them to abstain from usual secular employments on that day, and assemble in their accustomed places of worship, to offer to Him the sacrifice of Prayer, Praise and Thanksgiving: -- for the fruitlessness of the fields and the evidences of plenty which everywhere abound; for the prevalence of health; for the educational, charitable and religious institutions of the State; for the homes of peace and affection, and of substantial comfort, so generally enjoyed by the people; for equal and just laws; for the Government of the fathers, so wise, beneficent and kind, and though wickedly assailed, still standing firmly in the affections and patriotism and power of the people; for "the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ, for the means of grace, and the hope of glory."</p>
<p>Especially let our Thanksgiving be expressed, that at the first note of alarm, the loyal American people of all professions, pursuits, parties and opinions, so spontaneously rallied in defence of our beautiful and beloved country, as to give assurance that, with the blessing of Providence, they will emerge from the struggle bringing their institutions with them, firmly established, and standing before the world a full demonstration of the power and stability of free government.</p>
<p>Let the fervent prayer arise for wisdom and virtue to guide us in this momentous period, that we may acquit ourselves as becomes a people so favored by ancestry and God. And though in our thanksgivings at this time, there may be less of carol than of solemn sound, yet if thinking of father, husband, brother or son, now upon the tented field, or in the soldier's grave, let us remember that it is noble to battle or die for country; and if affection must drop a tear to the memory of the departed, let us also give thanks for their unselfish endeavors and heroic death, in a grand and righteous cause.</p>
