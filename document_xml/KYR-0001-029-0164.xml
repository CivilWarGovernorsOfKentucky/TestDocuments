   <p>To His Excellency James F Robinson
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Bridget Kearney would most respectfully say that she was fined in the City Court of Louisville seventy five dollars on two several Indictments for alleged assaults &amp; Batteries both having occurred on the same difficulty -- She is a widow with two children of her own and an orphan child she is Rearing -- </p>
<p>She observed at her own door a fight among some Irishmen when a young man was engaged, that had previously been badly wounded, and the same was about being beaten by these men -- She very naturally took part with this young man ^who^ was a cripple and an acquaintance of her former husband -- One of the Irishmen was roughly handled and she was blamed for it.</p>
<p>She was fined $50 -- on one Indictment &amp; $25 -- on the other -- She is a widow supporting three children and is destitute of any property save &amp; except household furniture and that very scanty. She will be compelled to go to the workhouse if these fines are not <hi rend="underline">remitted</hi>. She prays your Excellency to<pb/>
<lb/>remit these fines -- The men who were beaten were stout ablebodied Irishmen &amp; she a<hi rend="str">n</hi> <hi rend="str">Irish</hi> woman. She refers to names below for recommendation as to character and standing -- </p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Bridget Kearney</hi></p>
<p>We whose names are hereto signed nor acquaintanced with Mr<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> Kearney, and urgently request your Excellency to <hi rend="underline">remit</hi> <hi rend="underline">her</hi> <hi rend="underline">fines</hi> -- </p>
