   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Joel Beaton will state that, at the <date when="1863-03">March term of the Fulton Circuit Court for 1863</date> he was fined the sum of Sixty dollars upon an Indictment charging him with keeping a Tipling house. He states that at the time the offense was alleged to have been committed he was vending liquors in the town of <unclear>Ludgton</unclear>, but in a house different from the one in which the Tavern was kept, &amp; which he was advised was no violation of law, &amp; in fact previous to the indictment he had been indicted and tried upon a similar charge &amp; Judge Bigger who then presided decided that it was no violation of law to vend liquors in a house different to the one in which the Tavern was kipt &amp; under this decision he continued to keep his grocery in a house different from the Tavern house &amp; upon this indictment refered to he by Judge Marshall was fined, upon the same facts as proven before Judge Biggor,</p>
<p>At the time he was selling &amp; when the Licenses were obtained it was the opinion of Counsel with whom he asked advice &amp; the county judge that he would be incuring no risk or violating any law to sell in or keep his grocery in a house different from the Tavern house,</p>
<p>We thereupon ask that the fine be released,</p>
<p>Joel Beeton<pb/></p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of <unclear>Lodgton</unclear> and vacinity ask your Excellency to remit the fine inflicted upon M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Beeton</p>
