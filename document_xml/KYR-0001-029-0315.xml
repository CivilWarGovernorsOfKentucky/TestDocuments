   <p>Frankfort Ky
<lb/><date when="1863-04">April 1863</date>. -- 
<lb/>His Excellency J F. Robinson</p>
<p>Your petitioner Timothy Sullivan would respectfully represent to your Excellency that some time in the month of <date when="--02">February</date> last he was fined before J. R. Graham, Police Judge of Frankfort the sum of Ten Dollars, for an alledged breach of the peace. Your petitioner would further state that at the time of the occurrence he was under the influence of liquor and is unable to state what did occur, that he is a poor man and has to rely upon his daily labor for a support, that owing to the times and difficulty of procuring work he finds that a support is all that can possibly be made, and that any fine however small is a serious matter with a laboring man with<pb/>
<lb/>a family, he humbly prays your Excellency to remit the fine if in your judgment the costs are enough for him to pay. </p>
<p>If however you do not deem it a case in which you can use the Executive Clemency to the fullest extent, he prays that a respite may be granted to enable him to make the money to pay of the fine</p>
<p>Timothy Sullivan</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens unite in the prayer of Timothy Sullivan and respectfully ask that his petition be granted.</p>
