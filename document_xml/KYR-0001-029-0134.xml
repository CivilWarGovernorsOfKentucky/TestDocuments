<lb/>To His Excellency James F. Robinson -- 
<lb/>Gov. of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I enclose herewith the verified petition of William Beaucamp as also a petition signed by a good number of his neighbours asking your Excellency to reprieve said Beaucamp from the prosecution two Indictments pending against him in the Fleming Circuit Court. And I would respectfully State that I am personally acquainted with Beaucamp and all or nearly all the persons who have signed his petition -- I was also to some extent cognizant of the affray between Beaucamp and Keithly -- and I am of the opinion that Beaucamp tells the truth about it in his petition -- I moreover believe that his prosecution is not desired, and that as he desires to leave the state I respectfully unite with others <hi rend="str">a</hi> in praying your Excellency to reprieve him -- Beaucamp is a mechanic, industrious and respectable -- with a large and helpless family of little children -- Keithly is a very disreputable, bad man -- I trust you will consider it consistent with your duty to reprieve Beaucamp -- </p>
<p>I am Dear Sir
<lb/>Your ob<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Serv<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi>

<p>His Excellency Jas. F. Robinson
<lb/>Gov. of Ky.
<lb/>Frankfort
<lb/>Ky.</p>
<p>Examined</p>
<p>The grounds for relief in this case are all reliable before a Jury &amp; will in all probability those avail -- It is a very dangerous exercise of Executive power to omit the trial by jury. Surely no ground that it is inconvenient to the accused to await &amp; atttend the trial -- The Executive in my opinion should not interpose in the <unclear/> prosecution of this case</p>
