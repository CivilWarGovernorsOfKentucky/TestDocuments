<lb/>His Excellency Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>I have only a few minutes since seen the Adjt Genl's Orders in relation to the draft <unclear/> This measure is one of necessity and meets my most hearty approval. It is the only one calculated to preserve the integrity and <hi rend="underline">status of</hi> Kentucky and should have been long since adopted. In no part of the State, is the plan of defence contemplated more needed than here.</p>
<p>If I am not regarded as presumptuous, I will only say that if the appointment of Colonel is offered me, I will accept; but the time for raising a State Guard ought to be extended to some twenty days after the receipt of the Commission. My references are General Combs, Col Bolling, R K Williams Esq, Judge of the Court of Appeals. J. J. Miller Esq, the Messers Harlans, and almost any citizens of Frankfort.</p>
<p>For Lieut Col. I would recommend Geo M Wilburn or W M Buckner Esq. The later named gentleman is a civil engineer and a man of good capacity.</p>
<p>With great respect
<lb/>Your Obt Servt Geo C Hallet<pb/></p>
