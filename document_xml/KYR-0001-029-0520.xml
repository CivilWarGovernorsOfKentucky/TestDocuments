   <p>To His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">J A Robinson</persName><lb/>Governor of :<orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName></p>
<p>As Magistrate in the  I tried the case of the Commonwealth of Kentucky vs W<placeName ref="cwgk:P00000936">City of Covington</placeName><hi rend="sup">m</hi> Schmadde the driver or Agent of <persName ref="cwgk:N00000458">C, W, Roback</persName>, The proof showed that  had obtained a License <persName ref="cwgk:N00000458">C, W, Roback</persName><hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>from the  and that the Dependant was his driver or Agent: this was proved by oral proof and by the License with an endorsement upon it. It also appeared that the License had issued to Mr Roback and not to the driver under the instructions of the <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000936">City of Covington</placeName> who issued it. As I<persName ref="cwgk:N00000961">Mayor of the City</persName><pb/>
<lb/>took the view that the License should have issued to the driver, I felt compelled to fine the Defendant $50 and costs. But as I am satisfied that the instructions of the Mayor led the Defendant into this difficulty, I believe it a case Justly claiming the Executive clemency, and Join in a prayer to have the fine remitted.</p>
