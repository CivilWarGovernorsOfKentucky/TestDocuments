<lb/>Hon Thomas E Bramlette
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned petitioners would respectfully represent that L. D. Kirkendoll at the <date when="1859-03">March Term of the Ohio Circuit ^1859</date>^ had a judgment recovered against him for not for Seventy five Dollars. And lost prosecution.</p>
<p>When the Judgment was recovered against him he was in the State of Illinoise sick and could not attend the trial. He says he was not guilty of the riot. which was proven by one James Warren. who he has since had Indicted for perjury. We would further represent that the said Kirkendoll is poor man. and a man of family. And we believe the collection of the fine would break him up</p>
<p>We further believe the prosecution was gotten up through Malice. And that under all the circumstances this as a clear case for Executive Clemency. And we do hope you will remit his fine</p>
