   <p>State of Kentucky
<lb/>Hancock County
<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>the Govenor of Ky.</p>
<p>The undersigned John C. Thomas R. J. Blanford, A. G. Vawter, R. A. Higdon. D. Dunn and Henry Dale would most respectfully state and represent to his excellency the Govenor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky that in <date when="1859-08">August 1859</date> David Cook had a difficulty and encounter in the town of Lewisport in this county with one Hutchinson and in the difficulty Cook fired a pistol at Hutchinson as these petitioners then and now believe render circumstances of justification. Hutchinson made his escape and Cook was arrested and committed for trial on the <date when="1859-08-20">20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of August 1859.</date> and held to bail to appear at the next circuit court and the petitioners afs<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. became his bail in the penalty of one hundred dollars. Cook was sick and unable to attend said term of the court. An indictment was found agst him at the <date when="1859-08">Aug. term 1859.</date> of the Hancock circuit court.</p>
<p>Cook having removed to Spencer County in the State of Indiana your petitioner J. C. Thomas<pb/>
<lb/>applied to your excellency for a requisition and on the <date when="1859-10-08">8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of Octo 1859</date> obtained your excellencys requisition authorisizing him to proceed to the State of Indiana for the purpose of demanding and receiving from the proper authorities of said State the said Cook and thereupon the said J. C. Thomas obtained a warrant of arrest agst s<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Cook from the Govenor of the State of Indiana and placed the same in the hands of the Sheriff of Spencer County in said State in which county said Cook then and still resides and the said Sheriff although often requested &amp; urged so to do failed and actually refused to arrest the said Cook and deliver him as required by the warrant of the Govenor of Indiana.</p>
<p>At the <date when="1861-02">Febuary term 1861</date> of the Hancock Circuit Court said bail bond was forfeited and judgment rendered agst your petitioners for the same of one Hundred dollars -- &amp; costs. The original requisition and duly certified copies of the Indictment, Bail Bone and judgment afs<hi rend="sup">d</hi> are herewith filed as part hereof.</p>
<p>The undersigned were and are now confident said Cook would have been acquited if he had stood his trial<pb/>
<lb/>They used every effort in their power to bring him to trial and would have succeeded in the Sheriff of Spencer County Indiana where Cook resided had done his duty.</p>
<p>Your petitioners are poor men and would be greatly oppressed by being compelled to pay the amt afs<hi rend="sup">d</hi> adjudged agst them</p>
<p>Whereupon they petition the clemency of your Excellency and pray a remission of the judgment afs<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> agast them &amp;c. and as in duty bound they will ever pray &amp;c.</p>
