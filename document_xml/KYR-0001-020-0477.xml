   <p>To the Hon Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Gov of Ketucky</p>
<p>The undersigned your petitioner would respectfully state that at the Special term of the Carroll Circuit Court held in <date when="1860-11">November 1860</date> Paschal Hundley was fined twenty dollars for gaming on premises. Your petitioner further states that the game was but a trifling stake; indeed he was not aware that any money was at stake, amusement alone being his object. He is not a gambler and seldom plays cards</p>
<p>Your petitioner would further state that at the same term of said Court, he was fined in the sum of ten dollars for selling whisky in violation of law He does not keep a tipling house as was not aware that he was violating any law. He has sold no whiskey since nor does he intend to do so He is a poor man and we therefore respectfully request and pray that your Excellency will remit said fines</p>
<p>Paschal Hundley</p>
<p>Ben. M. Hitt</p>
