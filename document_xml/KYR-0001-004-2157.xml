   <p>Louisville <date when="1865-08-14">Augt 14 1865</date>
<lb/>Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> T. E. Bramlette
<lb/>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Sir</p>
<p>In The city Court of Louisville there was a judgment obtained against Messrs Williams &amp; Russell for Keeping and Conducting a lottery establishment in this City -- in Violation of the Statutes. It is Certainly a great stretch of the immagination to Construe their business into a lottery Establishment The main business, is set forth in plain terms in the petition, and the testimony also -- The business that they Call lottery is clearly not a business of much proffit to Williams &amp; Russell -- It is quite a matter of amusement, and does attract some business to his house, and that is all the advantage really that he receives from this part of it -- Williams &amp; Russell. have quite a stock of Jewlery on hand, in one apartment<pb/>
<lb/>of a large show Case they have a sample of Every article -- That they have in another apartment of the Show Case enclosed in <hi rend="str">a</hi> small paper Boxes. running from a Gold watch worth $30 -- or $40 -- to a Single Chain of Coral -- the average Cost of the entire stock of Jewelry in the Boxes. <hi rend="str">Cost</hi> Is a fraction less than one dollars each -- But the average selling price in the retail Establishments of the City -- is not less, than one dollar -- but his sign in front of the door attracts the Crowd -- Some persons, call as a matter of curiosity to see what it means and while looking at his stock -- See Something that they want &amp; buy it -- Some persons -- pay a dollar<hi rend="str">s</hi> and select a Box &amp; open it -- And always find an article of Jewelry in it -- If they are not satisfied Williams &amp; Russell will take it back and for half dollar more give the Cus<pb/>
<lb/>tomer another chance -- or as many chances as they may choose at the same rate I have seen men selecting -- Boxes in this way, and when they were don -- They could not go into any Jewelry establishment in the City and buy the same articles for the money -- all prises and no blanks and -- how Can it be construed into a lottery under the Construction of our Statutes -- &amp; besides before Williams would do any business of this Sort He enquired of a lawyer if there was any statute forbiding such an interprise -- and he was assured there was not -- he has closed his doors -- and boxed his goods and awaits the action of your honor. He will not open this business again in this City -- He has replevied the judgment, and I hope Your Excellency will remit the fine -- or Judgment. He is a Gentlman &amp; will not be guilty of any violation of law knowingly</p>
<p>D R Haggard<pb/></p>
<p>Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> will you be kind Enough to Send this by the Evenings mail, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Williams &amp; Russell wants to go with their stock of Jewelry to Nashville and dont want to leave -- until the Case is disposed of -- &amp; oblige your friend</p>
<p>D, R, Haggard</p>
