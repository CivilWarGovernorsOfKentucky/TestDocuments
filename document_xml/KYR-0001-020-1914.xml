   <p>To his excellency the Governor of Kentucky your Petitioner Jacob Robinson would respectfully represent -- to your Excellency, that at this April Term of the Pendleton Circuit Court your petitioner, Jacob Robinson, was fined three hundred and sixty five dollars, for obstructing a public Road in said county -- your petitioner would state that he was the owner of a tract of land and one B F Fugate was the owner of an adjoining track and a road was attempted to be established upon the line between said farms -- The court failed &amp; refused to establish said road the public used a road for some 20 years which was occasionally worked, and in a <unclear/> your petitioner &amp; Fugate to settle the dividing line between said farms -- the same was fixed and the road <unclear/> and would leave a small strip of land on the side next to Fugate, wholly useless to him he applied to the County court to change the road so as to give him use of his land, the court refused to make an order upon the ground, that the said road had never been established, your petitioner fenced up his land leaving thirty feet next to the line for a road, and for this he was indicted &amp; fined three hundred and sixty five dollars -- your petition says that he acted in good faith, honestly believing that he had the right to set his fence within the thirty feet of the line, and when a road has not been established by the court -- it was no road -- yet he was willing to give the thirty feet -- your petitioner deems it a hard case, and if the fine is coerced will be very oppressive -- he therefore asks that the same may be remited</p>

<p>I defended Mr Robinson, and I was satisfied the old man of the court has established the line -- that he was doing no wrong -- particularly after county Courts refused to act because the road had never been established -- I think it is a clear case for the interposition of the executive</p>
