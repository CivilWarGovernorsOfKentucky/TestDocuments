   <p>To the Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>John Macklin &amp; G. W. Cohorn, citizens of Franklin county respectfully state that the Sheriff of Franklin county has in his hands and demanding payment of an execution in favor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky against them for three hundred dollars and costs upon a judgment of the Scott cirucit court <hi rend="str">upon</hi> at its <date when="1864-11">November Term 1864.</date></p>
<p>Said liability came upon them as follows: One W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> H. Cohorn the brother of said G. W. Cohonr <hi rend="str">while</hi> being a member of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Regiment of Kentucky Infantry, was at home on furlough in the Spring of <date when="1864">1864,</date> was charged with committing a felony, arrested and put in the Scott county Jail. The petitioners went to Georgetown and entered bail for his appearance in the sum of three hundred dollars for his appearance. for trial -- Immediately upon his release from jail upon said surety being given, John Long, Provost Marshal of Scott County arrested said W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> H. Cohorn, took him from the possession of the petitioners, carried him straightway to Lexington, from which point he was sent by the military authorities of the United States to his regiment then with General Sherman, on the Atlanta campaign. He has ever since been, and is still with his regiment at the front, and has all the time been beyond the reach of the petitioners and of the process of the civil courts of this state. All this was without the connivance or consent of the petitioners and beyond their power or control -- <pb/>
<lb/>said W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> H Cohorn allways bore a good character, and has been in the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Infantry ever since <hi rend="str">his</hi> its organization -- Petitioners are satisfied that he would have stood his trial, but for the arrest by the provost Marshall. Petitioner Macklin has known Cohorn from his infancy and can speak positively as to his good character, and is assured that the trouble which resulted in his arrest by the civil authorities was caused by liquor, to which he was rarely addicted. He was at home on furlough and fell into bad company. It was beyond the power of petitioners to have produced the accused, and his absence as before stated was without the consent or connivance of them. Besides himself there are three other brothers in the Federal Army, and none of them were ever Known to be guilty of a dishonorable act -- </p>
