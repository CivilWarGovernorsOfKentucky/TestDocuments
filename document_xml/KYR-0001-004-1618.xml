   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>Your petitioner Jacob Torian, a citizen of Christian County in this state, respectfully shows</p>
<p>That at the last term of the Christian Circuit Court he was convicted of keeping a gambling house and fined three hundred Dollars</p>
<p>That the facts in the case are your petitioner did not intentionally infringe the law but violated it in ignorance of its provisions, in this that some acquaintances came to his room and played cards, without obtaining<pb/>
<lb/>his permission -- thus although he saw them play he was ignorant that his failure to prohibit it rendered him amenable to the law -- </p>
<p>That he suffered the gaming of which he was convicted out of curtisy and a mere act of hospitality -- That he never did keep a gaming house in the true acceptation of the term, that all that hapened at his room as a few games of cards among your petitioners friends, more for amusement than any thing else, from which he desired no compensation</p>
<p>That the room where said gaming occured was your petitioner'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> bed room<pb/>
<lb/>and not a place kept for gaiming -- That your petitioner was influence solely by a spirit of hospitality in allowing gaiming at his room, and he would never have permited it, had he known that it was in violation of law -- That your petitioner is a young man without means and is unable to pay said fine without great embarisment, wherefore he respectfully prays that your Excellency may remit the fine, and as in duty bound would ever pray -- </p>
<p>Jacob Torian</p>
<p>Sworn to and subscribed before me this <date when="1865-03-29">29 day of March 1865 -- </date></p>
<p>J Moore J P<pb/></p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Christian County respectfully state that they are well acquainted with the petitioner Jacob Torian, that he is a young man of good Character, and they believe the statements contained in his petition to be true</p>
