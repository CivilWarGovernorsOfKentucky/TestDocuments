   <p>To
<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Governor Bramlette</p>
<p>The undersigned L. G. Webster states, that at the present term of the Fayette Circuit Court, he was indicted for dealing <hi rend="str">for</hi> Faro, and judgment rendered for $500<hi rend="sup">x</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi>, He represents to your Excellency that the payment of the fine would be oppressive to him, and he says that he has cheated no one. wronged no one, and merely indulged in card playing from the influence of circumstances surrounding him, He says he has been a quiet, orderly citizen, true ^to^ his Government, his Country, and its flag. and he feels that in the midst of peculation and frauds of high officials, and the general demoralization of the Country, it would be hard on him to crush him with fines and penalties <hi rend="str">upon</hi> for a little card playing, This will teach him a lesson from which he purposes to learn much for his interest, He appeals to you Governor to relieve him as far as you can, from the effects of an admitted indiscretion. This he feels sure will be agreeable to all good citizens of Lexington</p>
