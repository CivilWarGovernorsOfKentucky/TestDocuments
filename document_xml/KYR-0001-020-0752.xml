<p>We the undersigned citizens and voters of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, in view of the fact that the general assembly was elected nearly two years ago, and does not now faily Represent the opinions of the people with Regard to the questions at present agitating the public mind, upon which question the opinions must have been formed since the election of their present Reprsentations. We Respectfully present unto your Excellency, that by the constitution established by our Reprsentatives and Ratified by us, it is expressly declared that it is one of the general, great and essential principles of liberty and free government, that the people have at all times the inalienable, and indefeasible Right to alter, Reform, and abolish their government as they think proper: That this inalienable Right does not in any degree, depend for its existence upon the will of the legislative or other departments of government</p>
<p>Therefore as Citizens and legal voters, we Respectfully present to your Excelency This petition whensoever the same shall appear, to be the expression of the people in the state, We request you to recognise ^it^ as the expression of the will of the<pb/>
<lb/>sovreign people of the Commonwealth, and thereupon authorise and direct you to issue writs of election for members of a convention, to meet at the capitol in Frankfort on some ^day^ to be fixed by you as soon as conviently may be. The Voters in each district entitled to elect Representatives in the town branch of the general assembly, to elect one member to the end that the people of Kentucky may by their Representatives, meet <hi rend="str">together</hi> and consult together upon the condition of the Commonwealth, and adopt such measures as may by them be deemed necessary for the assertion, maintainance, and protection of their rights, interest, and honor.</p>
