<p><milestone unit="column" n="1"/>To His Excellency B. Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of Commonwealth of Kentucky </p>
<p>Your Petitioner respectfully represents that on the <gap/> day of <date when="1860-08">August 1860</date> he became bound for the appearance in the Jefferson Circuit Court of Peter M<hi rend="str">c</hi>aGuire charged with the killing of one James Welsh -- </p>
<p>Petitioner states that the person who shot said Welsh was under arrest in the charge of Jno T. Gallagher and other Police officers of the city of Louisville, but Effected his Escape &amp; he is informed &amp; beleives has not since been retaken and the said M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">a</hi></hi>guire was arrested &amp; held over as aforesaid. Said circuit Court came on and an indictment was returned against said Maguire at the <date when="1860-10">October term of said Court for the year 1860</date> -- The accused appeared to answer the same, &amp; the trial was fixed for a day -- Maguire was required to renew his bond for his appearance on the day assigned and your petitioner stood bound for him -- From some strange cause the accused failed to appear Whereupon his recognisence was forfeited and such proceedings were had that on the <date when="1861-01-14">14 day of January 1861</date> judgment was rendered against your petitioner as bondsman aforesaid<pb/>
<lb/>for the sum of $1000<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> Petitioner is informed that the probable reason <hi rend="str">of</hi> <hi rend="str">the</hi> <hi rend="str">leaving</hi> why the said Maguire absconded was, that he was alarmed, by having been told by the officers of Police &amp; others that the grand jury had found an indictment against him for murder &amp; that he would be arrested &amp; no bail would be allowed.</p>
<p>Your petitioner was convinced that said Maguire had no connection with the killing of said Welsh, which was done on the wharf, in a large and excited crowd, which had just returned from a Prize fight a short distance above the city</p>
<p>The parties who realay committed the murder were arrested by the officers of Police but an Escape was committed by John Bohan and others, who are now in jail charged with said offence</p>
<p>After this escape had been made Maguire was arrested and thrown into jail. Your petitioner being well acquainted with the said Maguire &amp; believing him to be an innocent man was induced to become his bondsman &amp; he is satisfied that the accused would have stood his trial had he not been alarmed as has
<lb/><note place="left margin">Remitted
<lb/>B. M</note><pb/>
<lb/>been before stated -- </p>
<p>Your petitioner is a poor man &amp; the little he has, has been accumulated by years of hard work &amp; self denial -- All &amp; more than all of his savings will be taken away from him by the Enforcement of the judgment. The little he has was literally <hi rend="underline">scraped</hi> together by working as a day laborer in cleaning the streets of Louisville</p>
<p>Your petitioner after said Maguire absconded having heard that he had gone south, went at his own expense to Memphis &amp; New Orleans to find him so he might have him arrested &amp; brought to Louisville to stand his trial.</p>
