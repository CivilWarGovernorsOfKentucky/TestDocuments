It appeared on the trial that Phelps had contracted to sell the pistol which was owned by his son &amp; had taken it to the place where we was bound with it concealed on his person to deliver it to the purchaser &amp; get it out of his family -- but we were driven under our oaths to convict under the hard law as laid down by the court <date when="1860-08-17">August 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1860</date></p>
