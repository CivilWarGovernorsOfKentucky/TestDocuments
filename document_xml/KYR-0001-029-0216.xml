   <p>Germantown Ky <date when="1863-02-27">Febry 27th 1863</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency the Govenor of Kentucky.
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>Having learned that Jno W Elliott of this (Germantown) town was indicted by the Grand Jury of Bracken County at its present term, for illegally selling liquor to a Slave or Slaves and that he went before the court and confessed Judgment this day. Whereupon he got up a petition to your excellency for the purpose of having the fine remitted. Now Sir we as trustees of the town of Germantown and citizens of the same, looking to the interest of the town and community beg you <hi rend="str">to</hi> not ^to^ show <hi rend="str">him</hi> that leniency towards him with which you alone have the power. For the following reasons Viz. that he for the last two years has<hi rend="str">e</hi> been selling liquor in this town without license and in violation of all law. That he has and is ruining the young of our neighborhood. That he has been furnishing the Slaves of our town and community with liquors, thereby ruining that class of property. This has been done all so slyly that it is difficult for his detection but it is well known who it is that is doing this wrong in our midst. To him and his liquor may justly be attributed the cause of some 12 or 15 young men, and boys going to the rebel Army last fall. As the party to whom he furnished the fine was the same who went with Jno Morgan, and his whiskey was used to make some of them drunk in order to take them away. They would not have gone (as we veryly believe) if they had not beeen intoxicated at the time. For these and the hosts of other evels which are<pb/>
<lb/>the natural attendants upon and unbridled and vicious use of intoxicating liquors; (all of which you are well acquainted doubtless,) we ask you to let the law have its due course in this case; as we assure ^you^ that it is not a deed which demands the Executive clemency. For he is disloyal to the laws of his state and has made his boasts of his power to sell liquor regardless of law &amp; the wishes of the good citizens of the town &amp; community.</p>
<p>All of which we respectfully submit to your consideration hoping that you may be enabled to act for the good of your people.</p>
<p>By order of the Board of <hi rend="str">Chairman</hi> Trustees of the town of Germantown State of Kentucky</p>
<p>Chas S. Savage Chairman
<lb/>Attested
