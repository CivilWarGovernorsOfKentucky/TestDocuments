<lb/>Mr Taylor,
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I do not wish to intrude myself upon your labors in Frankfort, but at the instance of several members of the Bar and the urgent appeals of Mrs. Hedges &amp; her son I write you a line in regard to the old man now in our jail here suffering out his fine of $188; He is very poor, without a dollar in money: his two sons have both volunteered in the army &amp; his services are absolutely necessary to the comfort of his family=the first man will swear that Hedges did not want the house burned. be this as it may Hedges I understand is absolutely required at home He was in jail 2 months before trial and 25 days since. His wife comes to the jail every day or so and is very much distressed. Uncle Buck said to me to day that he would rather pay something himself rather than not have him out -- Winter is coming on &amp; his wife says if he can get out, they will try &amp; make arrangements to live during the winter -- what crop he has needs attention &amp; saving -- I would not urge this upon you did I not think it humanity to do so -- I know you will do what you think right &amp; it is not necessary for me to say <pb/>
<lb/>anything more -- a representation from you to Governor Robinson will be all that is necessary to obtain his pardon &amp; I sincerely hope it may seem good to you to exercise your influence with the Governor -- it is only for the sake of his wife &amp; the comfort of his family during the coming winter that I write to You this appeal. No news here -- the town is alive on Wadsworth Garnisher, tax questions -- generally against him -- </p>
<p>Yours very truly
<lb/>W H Savage</p>
