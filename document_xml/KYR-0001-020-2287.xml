   <p><hi rend="str">EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,
<lb/>Frankfort, Ky <gap/>, 186<gap/>
<lb/>Dear Sir</hi></p>
<p>Hon Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky,</p>
<p>I acted as as counsel of James <hi rend="str">V</hi> Shackelford who is now in the state prison upon a charge of Murdering George <unclear>Diorin</unclear>. both in the examining Court and the Circuit before which he was convicted and heard all the testimoney given in the case. I give it sincerely as my opinion that the verdict of "<hi rend="underline">guilty</hi>" brought in by the Jury was based upon the statement of a certain Jacob Claunche. who professed to detail all the facts &amp; circumstances of the difficulty in which Diorin was killed, A number of witnesses were examined in both trials &amp; no one of them so far as I can reccolect after being examined and cross-examined would state that<pb/>
<lb/>they saw Jacob Claunch upon the ground at the time of the difficulty. I will further say from all the evidence in the case I sincerely believe that Shackelford in all that he did acted in self defence and that the unfortunate difficulty was forced upon him</p>
<p>Very respectfully
<lb/>C. C. Smidley</p>
  </body>
