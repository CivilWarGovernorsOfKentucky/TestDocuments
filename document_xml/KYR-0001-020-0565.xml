   <p>To the Hon Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners respectfully represent, that a judgment was rendered at the <date when="1860-11">November term 1860</date> of the Clark Circuit Court Kentucky against John A Williams for Fifty dollars on a charge of carrying concealed weapons -- We desire a remission of that Judgment and respectfully refer to the Petition presented to your Excellency <date when="--10">last October</date> by John A Williams and others now on file in your Department which sought a Release from the Indictment, but upon which A remission of an alleged Judgment was issued, but that was before Judgment and by its terms could not be used -- it only came to Mr Williams' possession on the day before the case was set for trial, not giving him time enough to ask your further action, the only or best course left for him was to permit Judgment to go by default, and then call your attention to it, which we now desire to do, The papers presented in <date when="--10">October</date> as aforesaid will be found to contain very full and satisfactory reasons to justify your interposition, and we solicit a remission of said Judgment,</p>
