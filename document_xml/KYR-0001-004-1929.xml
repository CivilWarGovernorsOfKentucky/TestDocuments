<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E Bramlette,
<lb/>Governor State of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully represent unto your Excellency; that at the <date when="1864-08">August Term 1864</date> of the Barren Circuit Court, one Patrick Robinson, a priv of Co H. 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Regt Ky vols Infty. was sentenced to the Penitentiary of the state for the term of four Years, on the charge of shooting with intent to kill one W S. Painter a citizen of Barren County Ky,</p>
<p>The facts in relation thereto as near as Your petitioners are able to state them are as follows Said Patrick Robinson, was a deserter from the Rebel army, He returned home to Barren County from Said rebel army, when said W S Pointer, being a rebel, tried to have Robinson arrested and carried back to the rebel army, and thereupon a dificulty ensued between the parties,</p>
<p>In the mean time Robinson joined the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky cavalry, Federal -- and Served as a good and faithful soldier for a term of eighteen (18) months, when he came home on a furlough, when the old difficulty was resumed, when the shooting and wounding occurd on account of which Said Robinson was<pb/>
<lb/>convicted and sentenced as aforesaid -- Now we your petitioners would respectfully represent, That if said Robinson were guilty of said crime -- He was driven to it by the most aggravating circumstances, an effort being made to force him back into the rebel service, -- from which he had deserted and out of the Federal service. into which he had gone immediately upon his return home -- and in which he faithfully served as a good soldier up to the time of his arrest by the civil authorities, that he was tried in a county where a very strong, and almost overwhelming rebel element prevails -- and all the circumstances of this case being considered we would beg leave to recommend hi<hi rend="str">s</hi>m to your Executive clemency and ask that if <hi rend="str">consistent with</hi> the facts herein justify the same. he be pardoned -- and allowed to return home to assist in the support of his aged &amp; destitute parents and as in duty bound will ever pray &amp;c</p>
