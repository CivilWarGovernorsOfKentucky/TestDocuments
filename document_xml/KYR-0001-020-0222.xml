<lb/>Gov. Magoffin
<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir,</p>
<p>Messrs Barnes, Maupin and Hill who were the securities of Joseph Williams for his appearance in this court to answer three indictments pending against him, have to day shown me this petition to your Excellency for a Remission of the Judgt agt them on the Bench, they are all gentlemen of the highest Respectability, and the facts set out in the petition are so far as I can learn substantially true -- From My Knowledge of the gentlemen They would present as others -- if it would please your excellency to grant their prayer, it seems to me it could be no hurt to any one, and would be a benefit to the family of the accused and his creditors</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>W. S Downey -- </p>
