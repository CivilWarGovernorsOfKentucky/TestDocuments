   <p>To his Excellency, Ja<hi rend="sup">s</hi> F. Robinson, Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Susan Parker, Respectfully asks permission to represent to your Excellency in candor and truth the circumstances impelling her to beg the exercise of your Clemency on her behalf,</p>
<p>That she is a citizen of Frankfort and owner of the little home where she resides, having purchased the lot &amp; improved the same, that during the winter of <date when="1861">1861</date> &amp;c. she rented that portion of her house built &amp; designed for a store room, to one W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Watkins, that he occupied the same as his own property during his lease that she exercised no control or ownership over it or its management during the time whatever.</p>
<p>That subsequently, say at the <date when="--06">June</date> term of the Circuit Court for Franklin County, she together with said Watkins was fined the sum of sixty dollars each for keeping a tipling House &amp; Executive allowed to go.</p>
<p>She disclaims any knowledge that s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Watkins was dealing unlawfully in liquor, or any thing else, and although notified of the time &amp; trial she did not attend, not really knowing when or how to act in the premises, That she finds hereself wholly unable to pay the fine or any part thereof, and most earnestly begs that the same be remitted</p>
<p>Susan H. Parker</p>
<p>Sworn to by Susan Parker before one Police Judge of this City of Frankfort this <date when="1863-04-18">18" Day of Apl 1863</date></p>

<p>Before W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Watkins left for the Army he came to me and requested me to go with him to see Mrs. Parker as he wished to have some conversation with her in the presence of a witness -- during the conversation said Watkins said that Mrs Parker Knew nothing of his having liquor in that part of the house rented by him from her and he would make oath to the fact in Court. He also stated that he was the guilty party and not Mrs Parker.</p>
