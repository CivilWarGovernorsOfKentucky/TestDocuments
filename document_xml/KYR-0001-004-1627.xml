   <p>To His Excellency the Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Marion County Kentucky would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1865-02">last February</date> Term of the Circuit Court within and for the County aforesaid Mrs Irena Murphy was fined the sum of twenty Dollars for retailing spiritous liquors without a license. There was but one instance of selling proven, but they say that Mrs Murphy is and was at the time of the alleged selling a poor widow with two little children to support, (her boys having enlisted in the army of the United States at the beginning of the War.) and with no one to depend upon but herself. They say that in view of all the circumstances, that she was and still is a poor but honest and respectable woman, who cannot without being put in great distress and inconvenience pay the fine imposed upon her, that if really guilty of selling the liquor it was to enable her to obtain an honest lively hood for her self and her little children, it would be a praiseworthy Exercise of Executive clemency to remit said fine, and they accordingly pray your Excellency to do so -- and as in duty bound &amp;c --
