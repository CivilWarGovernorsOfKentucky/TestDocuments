<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Again I am Compelled to troubel you for a sworn Requisition, I took the Document you sent, and <hi rend="str">repared</hi> went to Indianapolis and Presented it to Gov. Morton, he refused to issue the warrant on the ground that it was not drawn According to Law, he stated that the Affidavit Should Be drawn the same as a full indictment, then that the Clerk of the County Court must certify that the Magistrate was Regularly Empowered to act, then the County Judge should Certify that the County Clerk was duly empowered By Law to act in that capasity, after I was refused the warrant, I submitted my Papers to one of the Best Lawyers in Indianapolis he stated that the Affidavit was<pb/>
<lb/>sufficient to Procure a warrant for a white man, But there weare defects in the affidavit (as Before stated) And they Availed themselves of them for the Negro, that to ^be^ thwarted in that way I returned home, wrote to Ownsboro, and the Gentleman that made oath to the Affidavit enclosed, arrived here last night, the magistrate requests you, to Append the Original Affidavit to the requisition, for <hi rend="underline">fear</hi> that if you Append a <hi rend="underline">Coppy</hi> they may still find <hi rend="underline">fault</hi>,</p>
<p>Please return me the Requisition as soon as Possible,</p>
<p>Yours truly,
<lb/>R. Gilchriest
<lb/>Policeman,
<lb/>Box 398 Louisville, Ky,</p>
