<p>The convention here in this Town on Monday last to make a nomination for Congress and Legislature was compelled to adjourn until the <date when="1865-06-15">15th of June</date>, in consequence of the condition of the Country being Such that no preliminary meetings had been held thro the Dist to select Delegates.</p>
<p>A number of active men here are desirous of going to work to organize Cos and Regts --, but they want some assurance of being sustained in their efforts.<pb/></p>
<p>Now Sir, in order to <hi rend="underline">effectually</hi> and <hi rend="underline">rapidly</hi> carry Your plans and orders into execution -- I respectfully request that R. D. Cunningham be commissioned Col -- and H, Bartling Lieut Col These Gentlemen are worthy and well qualified and will be endorsed by the Loyal Men of this Dist -- they have had a great deal of experience, having served over three years in this war.</p>
<p>I propose that the Gentlemen named be commissioned but not to draw any pay until the Amount of men requiste be raised and organized -- and the appointments be confirmed by the votes of the Line Officers, as directed by the Militia Law, Hoping to receive Your answer Soon</p>
<p>I have the honor to remain
<lb/>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Your Obdt Servant
