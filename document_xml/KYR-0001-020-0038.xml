   <p>To
<lb/>His Excellency Beriah Magoffin Govenor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>Dear Sir -- We the undersigned, citizens of Caldwell County Ky. have long known Thomas. B. Wadlington &amp; he has ever been considered a good &amp; true hearted citizen, Known &amp; noted for his industry &amp; his orderly &amp; peaceable conduct -- The difficulty in which he was engaged with M. A. Cartwright, did not appear to us to be of his seeking, nor are we satisfied that the case was fairly presented to the Jury as it occurred. We hope your Excellency will review the case &amp; give the poor man, the benefit of every doubt &amp; we desire that his case may be judged of in mercy &amp; regarded with favor, and that your Excellency will take into consideration every circumstance that ought to operate in his behalf. And we desire that your Excellency may be persuaded that it is consistent with your duty to extend to him Executive clemency and that his life may be spared, either by a full pardon or a commutation of his punishment -- Yours respectfully --
