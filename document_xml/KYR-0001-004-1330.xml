   <p>Greensburg Ky. <date when="1864-11-02">Novr. 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. 1864</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency T. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the <date when="1864-02">February</date> term of the Green Circuit Court, Y. O. Booker was Indicted<hi rend="str">ment</hi> for selling liquor without License, he immediately Petitioned your Excellency to remit the fine, upon the ground that his failure to renew his license at the proper time, was attributable to his forgetfulness, rather than to any other cause, and that as soon as he could, after being informed of his omission he renewed his license -- His petition was signed I believe by all the members of the Bar in attendance on Court and as well as I remember by the Judge also, and forwarded to you -- To which you promptly responded that you could not remit a fine until it had been assessed, that you thought his excuse sufficient, and intimated that it would be remitted at the proper time, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Booker has mislaid your letter, or it would be now inclosed to refresh your recollection on the subject At the <date when="1864-05">May term 1864</date> of our Court M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Booker making no defense was fined Sixty dollars, for which Execution issued, and is now in the hands of the Sheriff of Green County, and as its time is about to expire, he threatens to levy upon his property to satisfy the same At the request of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Booker I make this statement in the hope, that it may please your Excellency to remit the fine aforesaid, or as much thereof as you can consistently -- </p>
<p>Very Respectfully yours
