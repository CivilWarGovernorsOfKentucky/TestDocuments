   <p>To the governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>I certify that I presided over a writ of John Marshall against J<hi rend="str">ohn</hi>ane Marshall for her good behavior in pendleton county in the year 1863 for which the proof in case did not amount to any thing serious though the Judgment was for the defendant to appear at the next circuit court held in Said cty, for which he gave bond in the Sum of $250,00 with P S Ransom W, G, Wilson &amp; P. Louis Security.</p>
<p>as I am informed the defendant was a way from home at the time of trial and the Securities lost Sight of the case and failed to attend to it</p>
<p>and Judgment was rendered on the bond, it appears that the defendant lost Sight of the time of trial and the Securities also lost sight of the case Supposing it was all settled, as the plantif was the fatherinlaw of deft and I have heard no complaint of the defendants behavior Sinse that time given this <date when="1865-04-03">3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> day of Aprl 1865</date></p>
