   <p>To
<lb/>His Excellency Beriah Magoffin Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir -- </p>
<p>We, the undersigned citizens of Caldwell County Ky, have long Known Thomas. B. Wadlington &amp; he has ever been considered a good &amp; true hearted citizen, Known &amp; noted for his industry &amp; <hi rend="underline">orderly</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">peaceable</hi> conduct -- The difficulty in which he was engaged with M. A. Cartwright, did not appear to us to be of his seeking nor are we satisfied, nor do we believe, the case was fairly presented to the Jury as it occurred -- We hope earnestly that your Excellency will review the case, and give the poor man, the benefit of every doubt, and we desire that his case may be Judged with mercy &amp; regarded with favor -- &amp; that your Excellency will take into consideration every circumstance that ought to operate in his behalf -- And we desire that your Excellency may be &amp; will be persuaded, that it is consistent with your duty to extend to him Executive Clemency, and that his life may &amp; will be spared, either by a full pardon or a commutation of his punishment -- 
<lb/><date when="1861-01-22">Jany 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 1861</date> -- </p>
<p>Yours respectfully<pb/>
