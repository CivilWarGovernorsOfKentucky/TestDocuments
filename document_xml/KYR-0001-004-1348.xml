<p>I have known him for 12 years and have had intimate knowledge of his transactions, have always found him honest. never had any reason to think him otherwise, M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Lewis an old Citizen here and several Gentlemen testified to his previous good character, at his trial</p>
<p>His wife has 5 little children to support now, and shortly will be confined, I really cannot tell how she will be able to get through this winter without the help of her husband, -- and really believing him innocent of the crime, I would sincerely ask of your Excellency to extend to him the Executive Clemency</p>
<p>Very Respectfully yours
