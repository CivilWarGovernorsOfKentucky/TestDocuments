   <p>Hartford Ohio County Ky.
<lb/><date when="1863-10-23">Oct 23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> 1863</date>
<lb/>To his Excellency Thomas E Bramlett
<lb/>governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully represent that at the last term of the Ohio circuit court James A Thomas a judgement was rendered against James A Thomas and Peter Thomas for sixty dollars each under an indictment for keeping a tipling house in the town of Hartford. The house was kept by said James &amp; Peter Thomas was only a small boy who was attending to business for his Uncle James. The circumstances are then at the commencement of this war we had no one in this town who <hi rend="str">would</hi> sold liquor by the small with the exception of a secesh tavern keeper and we Union men were resolved not to purchase of him, we therefore called upon Mr Thomas to open a liquor establishment, which he did, and did sell it by the small, which we consider was necessary under the circumstances, he <hi rend="str">considers</hi> continued to sell until <hi rend="str">a</hi> loyal tavern keepers opened bars for the purpose, and then he discontinued &amp; has sold none since by the small. Now we do believe this is a proper case for executive clemency, and we ask you to remit the fine as far as you can and you will confer a great favor upon us who <hi rend="str">was</hi><pb/>
<lb/>were the cause of the opening of said establishment</p>
