   <p>Lexington, Ky., <date when="1864-11-30">Nov. 30. '64</date>
<lb/>Thos. W. Hawkins, Esq. -- </p>
<p>Your letter of yesterday has been received. I have no power whatever to order the sheriff to return the capias. There is no trouble about the matter whatever. You remember that I had a petition to hand the Governor for you to get him to remit all but the $150. which he only can do.</p>
<p>You had better go to the Governor at once, as all the others have done, and I have no doubt he will remit your fine. The Petition I had will not do, as the date is wrong. You will have no trouble, if you do as all the others have done.</p>
<p>Yours,
<lb/>John L. Scott.<pb/></p>
