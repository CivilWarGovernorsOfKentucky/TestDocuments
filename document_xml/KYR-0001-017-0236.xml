<lb/>C. C. BURT,
<lb/>ATTORNEY AND COUNSELLOR AT LAW,
<lb/>IN ALL THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF MISSOURI. and New York
<lb/>To his Excellency, the Governor of the State of Kentucky
<lb/>Honorable Sir:</p>
<p>Having changed my residence and place of business to this city, I would most respectfully solicit that your Excellency would do me the favor and honor to change my commission as Commissioner of Deeds, &amp;c., for the State of Kentucky residing in this State. Having been, for many years, a Commissioner of Deeds for most of the several States in the United States, I trust I shall be able (as I formerly have done) to perform the duties of said Commissioner faithfully, and for the benefit and convenience of all such as may entrust such Business to my care. This is a large Commercial City, and will doubtless, have much of this kind of business to do for this, and your own City and State.</p>
<p>With many thannks to you, and the late executive officers of your State, for favors conferred, permit me to subcribe myself,</p>
<p>Respectfully, your Humble Servant.
<lb/>Calvin C. Burt
