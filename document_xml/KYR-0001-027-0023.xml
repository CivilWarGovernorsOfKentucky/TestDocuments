<lb/>To Jas F. Robinson Esq
<lb/>Acting Gov of Ky</p>
<p>It is perfectly manifest that organized bodies of horsemen are roaming through Harrison County in the vicinity of the railroad after dark, drilling &amp; recruiting for the purpose of escaping to join some rebel force or to act in Conjunction with other rebel forces in the state. Meanwhile they are perpetrating outrages upon citizens by arresting them and tearing up rail road and stealing horses. None but a local force can break up these organizations and Capture the scoundrels Composing them. By calling into service for two or three months two or three hundred mounted home guards properly Equipped &amp; commanded quiet can be restored to this County. We unfortunately have a good many returned rebels from the rebel army who at first professed to be sorry for what they had done but who now show by their acts &amp; sympathies that they are spies ^for^ and coadjutors with their former companions in arms. No loyal man can be secure until the power of the government is shown to be sufficient to crush these bands -- the sooner it shall be done the better for all parties concerned. Provision for their subsistence &amp; pay must be made before<pb/>
<lb/>we can get the men to act. Four companies can be raised here immediately. <hi rend="str">And</hi> ^Two have already been raised who^ Elected Geo W Berry Major for their batallion. One raw regiment of Federal troops has been stationed here for a few days but the Colonel says that he is powerless for the reason that his men do not know the topography of the Country are not mounted and can not with sufficient speed pursue &amp; capture the mounted marauders we have intelligence of the existence of three companies floating about in this &amp; the lower edge of Bourbin County. Send Geo W. Berry a Commission forthwith to raise 400 men with the power to appoint quarter master &amp; means to get subsistence camp Equippage &amp;c We have <hi rend="str">a</hi>Arms for about 200 men and will need about as many more Berry can scour the Country to the Ohio river if necessary. But delay is <unclear/> dangerous. Promptitude &amp; energy must be the order of the day.</p>
<p>Yours Respy
<lb/>W W Trimble</p>
<p>P. S. T L Garrard jr the bearer hereof is fully advised of the Condition of the Country here is truthful &amp; entirely loyal -- and has been scouting since the day the rail road was torn up in this Co -- </p>
