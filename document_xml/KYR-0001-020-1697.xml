   <p>To the Hon. B Magoffin Governor of Kentucky </p>
<p>Your affiant James S Asbury would respectfully state, that in <date when="--05">May</date> last he was in Germantown upon the day of the election, that at the time he was not quite twenty one years old but only lacked a few days of it. He states that he did not go to said election with any intention of voting, but the judges of said election solicited him some two or three times to come and vote, he declined at first, but the judges still urgue him to come up and vote, and your affiant not knowing that there was any penalty attached to his voting, or that there was any thing wrong in so doing, finally consented and did vote simply for <hi rend="underline">Constable</hi>, but for no other officer -- he states that the officers of said election were well acquainted with him, and he had no idea that they would solicit him to do a thing that was in violation of the law, and he had no intention at the time of doing wrong. He states that he did not know the law, but he supposed that the judges did, and having confidence in them he did not suppose they would solicit him to violate the law.</p>
<p>At the August term of the Bracken Circuit Court some one procured an Indictment against him, and at the present February term, judgment was rendered against him for Fifty Dollars for said violation.<pb/>
<lb/>Your affiant most respectfully asks your Excellency, to remit said fine, he thinks it is a case in which your clemency ought to interpose, and arrest the rigor of the law, he claims to be a law abiding citizen, and would not knowingly violate the law in any particular.</p>
<p>Witness my hand this <date when="1862-02-25">25<hi rend="sup">h</hi> day of Febuary 1862</date></p>
<p>Sworn to before me by James S Asbury this <date when="1862-02-25">25<hi rend="sup">h</hi> day of Febuary 1862</date></p>
