   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Gov -- James F Robinson,
<lb/>Sir.</p>
<p>On the <date when="1859-12-31">31<hi rend="sup">st</hi> day of December 1859</date>, a youth by the name of Thomas Finnelly, was sentenced by the Judge of the Kenton Circuit Court, to serve a term of three years in the Ky Penitentiary, and at the expiration thereof, for another term of two years. As near as I can get at the case from a conversation with Mr W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> E. Arthur, who then was the Commonwealth, atty he and other boys were concerned in some petty thefts, connected perhaps with burglary. W. D. Young kept a Tailor shop -- his front window was broken and out of it was taken as charged in the Indictment, <hi rend="underline">two</hi> <hi rend="underline">shirts</hi> and one <hi rend="underline">silk</hi> <hi rend="underline">crevat</hi>,</p>
<p>The other Indictment, was for going into Miss Margaret Bayles cellar window -- thence up a trap door -- and taking from her money drawer a small amount in silver and a lot of copper coin, On these charges the two convictions were obtained Thomas Finley or Finney, was then about fifteen years of age the other boys were about the same age. Young Finnelly had been a good industrious lad until about 18 months or so before the trial, during that period or a portion of it, he had got into bad company, and <pb/>
<lb/>fell into bad habits -- with the above results. I learn from Mrs Finnelly -- that she has no one to look to for support except this boy Thomas -- She <hi rend="underline">washes</hi> for a living and has six children three boys and three girls -- the oldest is a boy who gets $2,50 per week -- boarded at <unclear/>, and one who gets $1, per week This is the only support, she has. I suggest that for the magnitude of the offenses, considering the youth of the boy, that this is a case that would justify Executive Clemency. The mother appears to be a very clever woman in deep distress, and greatly in need of the services of her boy.</p>
<p>You will please give this matter early attention -- </p>
<p>Respectfully yours
<lb/>John F. Fisk</p>
<p>I believe the statement to be substantially correct as to the matter of facts and as to the prayer of the petition I unite in it upon the ground that in view of the youth of the convict and the time he has served he is a fitting subject for Executive clemency</p>
<p>W. E. Arthur<pb/></p>
<p>Pettn for Thomas Finnelly
<lb/>Pardon</p>
<p>Under all the circumstances the youth -- the excellent behaviour attested to me by the Keeper since in prison -- the promises and professed penitence -- &amp; the punishment already inflicted -- I am of opinion that Thomas Finnelly should be pardoned &amp; so direct <date when="1863-01-15">15 Jany 63</date></p>
