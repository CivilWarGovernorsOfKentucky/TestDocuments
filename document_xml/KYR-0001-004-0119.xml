   <p><placeName ref="cwgk:P00000337">Louisville, Ky</placeName>. <date when="1863-10-24">Octr. 24th. 1863</date>
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Govr. Bramlette
</persName><lb/><placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort, Ky.</placeName><lb/>Dr Sir.</p>
<p>During my stay in this city I learn that my old friend, Franklin Gorin Eqr. has been indicted <hi rend="str">by</hi> in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001000">Jefferson Circuit Court</orgName>, for shooting, with intent to kill, a <persName ref="cwgk:N00000770">Mr. Wood</persName>. Permit me to say, I have known <persName ref="cwgk:N00000330">Mr. Gorin</persName>, <hi rend="underline">long</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">well</hi> &amp; a more generously impulsive, whole Souled Gentleman I never knew. he is <hi rend="str">wise</hi> kind-hearted, even to fault. I am advised satisfactorily, that the difficulty, in which he was involved with Mr. Wood, was the impulse of the moment, &amp; that <persName ref="cwgk:N00000770">Mr. Wood</persName> himself has had the magnanimity to say so, perhaps in a communication to you. My esteemed friend, Mr. Gorin, is greatly depressed &amp; afflicted on account of the Indictment pending against him growing out of the difficulty above refered to, &amp; seems to me, to be laboring under a morbid sensibility on the subject calculated to impair his health &amp; happiness. In view of the premises, permit me to ask the favor of you, if not deemed inconsistent with your duty, to interpose your executive clemincy in the case. I assure you, the pardon of <persName ref="cwgk:N00000330">Mr. Gorin</persName><pb/>
<lb/>would be a source of high gratification to his many attached friends in the <geogName ref="cwgk:G00003748">Green River</geogName> Country &amp; of undieing gratitude on the part of his estimable <persName ref="cwgk:N00007809">wife</persName> &amp; interesting family. ^I am satisfied the public interest will not suffer by the pardon of <persName ref="cwgk:N00000330">Mr. Gorin</persName>.^</p>
<p>With high consideration, I am, very respectfully
<lb/>&amp; truly
<lb/>Your friend &amp; servant
<lb/>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> V. Loving</p>
