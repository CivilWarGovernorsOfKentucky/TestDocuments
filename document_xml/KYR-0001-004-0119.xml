<lb/>Govr. Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort, Ky.
<lb/>Dr Sir.</p>
<p>During my stay in this city I learn that my old friend, Franklin Gorin Eqr. has been indicted <hi rend="str">by</hi> in the Jefferson Circuit Court, for shooting, with intent to kill, a Mr. Wood. Permit me to say, I have known Mr. Gorin, <hi rend="underline">long</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">well</hi> &amp; a more generously impulsive, whole Souled Gentleman I never knew. he is <hi rend="str">wise</hi> kind-hearted, even to fault. I am advised satisfactorily, that the difficulty, in which he was involved with Mr. Wood, was the impulse of the moment, &amp; that Mr. Wood himself has had the magnanimity to say so, perhaps in a communication to you. My esteemed friend, Mr. Gorin, is greatly depressed &amp; afflicted on account of the Indictment pending against him growing out of the difficulty above refered to, &amp; seems to me, to be laboring under a morbid sensibility on the subject calculated to impair his health &amp; happiness. In view of the premises, permit me to ask the favor of you, if not deemed inconsistent with your duty, to interpose your executive clemincy in the case. I assure you, the pardon of Mr. Gorin<pb/>
<lb/>would be a source of high gratification to his many attached friends in the Green River Country &amp; of undieing gratitude on the part of his estimable wife &amp; interesting family. ^I am satisfied the public interest will not suffer by the pardon of Mr. Gorin.^</p>
<p>With high consideration, I am, very respectfully
<lb/>&amp; truly
<lb/>Your friend &amp; servant
<lb/>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> V. Loving</p>
