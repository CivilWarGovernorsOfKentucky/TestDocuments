   <p>To His Excellency Beriah Magoffin, Governor of the state of Ky -- </p>
<p>Thomas Snyder the undersigned, most respectfully states that he was imposed upon by one Reed of Cincinnatti who paid him upwards of One Hundred and forty dollars all of which was counterfeit -- That on his way from said city to the state of Tennessee, he made some purchases in Louisville at houses <hi rend="underline">where</hi> <hi rend="underline">he</hi> <hi rend="underline">had</hi> <hi rend="underline">before</hi> <hi rend="underline">that</hi> <hi rend="underline">time</hi> <hi rend="underline">dealt</hi> -- His money was ascertained to be counterfeit and he was arrested -- He was tried for <hi rend="str">passing</hi> having bad money in his possession with the intent to circulate the same -- He was tried in May last, and the Jury disagreed. He was thus <hi rend="underline">bailed</hi> -- He returned and was again tried at this term and convicted for two years in the state prison -- </p>
<p>He avows and reiterates his innocence of any crime -- He had dealt in goods with the States' witness for five years and no suspicion or charge or grounds of charge had ever been proferred against him. He asks your Excellency to pardon him, and hopes to the petition of the Jury subjoined herewith -- </p>
<p>Most respectfully
<lb/>Thomas Snider<pb/></p>
<p>To His Excellency the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>Inasmuch as the case of the within named Thomas Snyder presents strong grounds for our sympathies, we cheerfully ask your Excellency to pardon him -- </p>
