   <p>His Excellency -- 
<lb/>Gov Bramlette</p>
<p>The high standing and known loyalty of the signers of the accompanying petition forbid that I should refuse to comply with their request to forward it to you -- </p>
<p>I know you have already done your whole duty in the effort to relieve Ky from these troubles &amp; disturbances -- </p>
<p>Each signer of this petition is a good &amp; true Union man -- In addition to this petition I have recd this enclosing various letters from loyal citizens of Christian County appealing to me to do something for their relief. All represent a most desperate state of feeling among the loyal citizens of<pb/>
<lb/>that truly loyal <hi rend="str">citizens</hi> ^county^ Utter ruin is impending -- indeed I may say is already upon them -- </p>
<p>They say that the negroes going off from Christian County by droves are met at the State line by armed soldiers &amp; escorted to the recruiting Camp at Clarksville and furthermore they are satisfied that secret recruiting agents are at work throughout the heart of Ky.</p>
<p>My information from the Secty of War was that the establishment of these recruiting camps for negroes in <unclear>Tenn</unclear> was left altogether to the discretion of the local military authorities and in view of this fact I suggest that an appeal to Genl<pb/>
<lb/>Rousseau <hi rend="str">&amp; &amp;</hi> and Gov Johnson might have <hi rend="str">to</hi> some effect -- </p>
<p>I am most Respctly
<lb/>Yr Obt Svt
<lb/>B. H. Bristow</p>
