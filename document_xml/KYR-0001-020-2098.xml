   <p>To His Excellency the Hon. B. Magoffin Gov. of Commonwealth Ky</p>
<p>Your petitioners that Tho Callaghan was fined the sum of twenty dollars for selling a single drink of whisky at the last term of the Franklin circuit court. now we whose names are hereunto subscribed respectfully ask of your Excellency to remit said fine because the said Callaghan is a good citizen. a law abiding man. and did not intend to violate the law -- for as much as the liquor was sold by his clerk and not by himself. and there was no proof that it was sold by his knowledge consent or advice. In view of all this we pray the fine may be remited. &amp; we will ever pray &amp; &amp;.</p>
