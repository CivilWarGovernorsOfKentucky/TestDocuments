<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I send certificate of election of James P. Mitchell, Esq., to fill vacancy in the office of County Judge. He is of opinion that he must be commissioned, and declines to act until he ascertains whether it is required in such a case, though some of the bar, think from the Statute, that a commission is not required. He desires me to request that his commission, if one is necessary, be forwarded immediately, and if not that he be notified of the fact, as we are now without a Judge. His address is Danville</p>
<p>Yours, truly,
<lb/>Ja<hi rend="sup">s</hi> F. Zimmerman. C B C C</p>
<p>To the Secy of State,
<lb/>Frankfort, Ky.</p>
  </body>
