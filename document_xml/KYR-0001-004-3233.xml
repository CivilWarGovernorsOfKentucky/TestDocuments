   <p>To His Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner fined for a breach of the peace, $40 &amp; costs by the City Court of Lexington, respectfully represents that he is an old and very poor man with a dependent family to support: that to pay the fine &amp; cost will require one hundred days of work in the Work House of Lexington, during which time his family <hi rend="str">way</hi> will be forced to go to the Poor House. He humbly believes that his fine was unjust - that neither in intention, nor fact did he violate any law; but acted as he verily believed in strict self-defence. But he places this appeal to your Excellency's Clemency, not upon the merits of his case, but his old age, his Extreme poverty, his helpless family. He knows your Excellency will appreciate how keenly he would feel to have his family sent to the Poor House &amp; himself to the Work House. The offense is one- if one at all- of temper, and you Petitioner during a long life has tried to live an upright, law abiding industrious life. He prays Your Excellency to remit as much of the fine as is ^<hi rend="str">in</hi>^ your pardon.</p>
<p>And he will ever pray.
<lb/>Barney Gilroy<pb/></p>
<p>We respectfully ask your Excellency to grant the petition of Barney Gilroy.</p>
