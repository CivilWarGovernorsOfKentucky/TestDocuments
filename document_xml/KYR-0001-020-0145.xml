   <p>Greenville, Ky. <date when="1860-10-25">Oct 25, 1860</date>
<lb/>His Excellency, B. Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>We petitioned you in respect to two <hi rend="underline">Indictments</hi> <hi rend="underline">pending</hi> against us in Muhlenberg Circuit Court, for gaming, or rather charging us with gaming, Stating that we were really not guilty, and explaining the circumstances under which we were indicted. We respectfully asked your Excellency to interpose and remit before a trial was had, if you should deem it proper to do so.</p>
<p>We have received from Excellency a paper purporting to remit two <hi rend="underline">Judgments</hi> against us and others, viz. Hay, Mann, Simpson &amp; Dr Rice, each for $20. No judgments have been rendered against us, but the other<pb/>
<lb/>persons named did confess judgments at the <date when="1860-05">May term</date> and you granted them remission, some time last <date when="1860-05">May</date> or <date when="1860-06">June</date>. Supposing that you had overlooked these facts, we venture to address you again on the subject, and respectfully ask you to reexamine the petition; and, if you regard our appeal to be meritous, to so grant the remission as to embrace the pending indictments.</p>
<p>We are profoundly grateful for the Kindess already manifested toward us by your Excellency, and nothing but our solicitude to be spared the mortification of a trial, involving no dishonor to be sure, but it would be food for malice causes us to trouble you again.</p>
<p>We were ^willing^ not confess judgment<pb/>
<lb/>&amp; compound with the att'y for the Com<hi rend="sup">th</hi> as Mr Hay &amp; the others did; and we are equally unwilling to be convicted, in a puritanic community, of being gamblers, when we only played for cigars, and for coffee grains which nominally represented half dimes, which were never intended to be paid, all in the way of amusement, &amp; not for gain.</p>
<p>Please recur to the petition we first sent you, and, if within the scope of your power, interpose to remit as therein prayed, and you will render to your friends an invaluable favor and place them under lasting obligations to you.</p>
