<lb/>Dear Judge</p>
<p>On the 20<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> of April, Wilkins Warner, brutely murdered a man by the name of Adams in this County near Polksville. The Coroner held an inquest over him and found that he had been brutely murdered by Warren,, Warren took him and tied him to a tree and casterated him, then he cut off his left ear, and after torturing him he shot him twice once through then abdomen, then through the head, stripped him of his clothing and left him. Adams<pb/>
<lb/>as far as Known was a peacible quiet man, had been robbed by Guerillas in Letcher County where he resided and was going in the neighborhood ax sharpening to work,</p>
<p>Revised Statues Vol 1 page 374 Sec 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> requires that a petition signed by the County Judge or Circuit Judge should be the basis of the action of the Govenor in offering a reward for the apprehension of persons guilty of aggrevated crimes,,</p>
<p>We have no County Judge and I presume the duty will devolve upon you.. Please attend to this at once. Warren was in Maysville on yesterday I sent B W to Mason, Fleming, Bracken Campbell, &amp; Kenton,</p>
<p><note place="left margin">The citizens are very much excited over it
