<p>W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> H. Morehead states, that he is acquainted with James Blalock who gave evidence in the case of the Commonwealth against Thomas B. Wadlington and with his general Moral character and from his general Moral Character he does not believe he is entitled to credit as a sworn witness in a court of Justice. and he believes the most of those acquainted with him would not believe him on oath. and he believes the statements made by him as a witness on said trial as to the manner of the Killing and as to how the difficulty between Wadlington &amp; Cartwright commenced is not true. He further states, that he has Known Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> B. Wadlington for a number of years last past, and he has always regarded him as a sober honest and peacable citizen and such is and has been his general character among his acquaintances.</p>
