   <p>Kentucky Franklin County, Sct</p>
<p>William A Morrison states that he is well acquainted with E. T. Herndon now confined in the Kentucky Penitentiary by the judgment of the Grant Circuit Court in the year <date when="1859">1859</date>. Said Herndon has a wife and family of children dependent upon him and upon the charity of others. They are in needy circumstances- Affiant has from time to time, at the instance of said Herndon furnished his family with money to live on. He had had frequent conversations with said Herndon, and is satisfied that he will henceforth aim to live the life of a law abdiding citizen. And his uniform good conduct in the prison, as represented by the officers and guards, justifies this hope and belief entertained by affiant.</p>
