<lb/>To Gov Magoffin
<lb/>Dr Sir</p>
<p>I venture to intrude for a moment upon your time to make some inquiries, first is it possible that no arms can be procured from the state without those getting them taking the oath prescribed by the Legislature of Ky, There are but few persons on the boder that recieve such arms except such as sympathize <hi rend="str">with</hi> openly with the adm<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> at Washington so that when the issue does come upon us as I trust it soon will we will be entirely at the mercy of our enemies, we had to disband a company here a few days ago for want of guns they not being willing<pb/>
<lb/>to take the oath required, It seems to me a fatal mistake to place all the arms in the state in the hands of such persons as will turn them against not only the seceding states but also the state of Ky if she should attempt to assert her rights, at all events it render<hi rend="sup">s</hi> it impossible to ever get a fare expression of the will of the people of the border counties at the ballot box, I feel confident that no one knows better than you do that terrorism will rule the hour when it comes.</p>
<p>If there is any way for us to get arms other than as above we would be glad to have them as we can reorganise our company at any time, We have two companies in this (Bracken) county armed with guns sent into the state by the order of Lincoln</p>
<p>If you will be kind enough<pb/>
<lb/>to answer this note and let me know how the matter stands</p>
<p>You will very oblige
<lb/>Your very Huml
