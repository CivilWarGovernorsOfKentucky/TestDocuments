I found on inquiry that the Bank Stock would not be sold at any price &amp; as money ^with which^ to pay what I owe is what I want it will not suit the purpose required I do not know that the Banks or <hi rend="underline">any one</hi> of them are taking any paper just now &amp; if this is the case I had as soon hold your note as Mr. Thomas' note_If you find that you can dispose of his note or Bill to any Bank it should be done by all means; I would be willing to lose a small per cent to get the cash, myself<pb/>
<lb/>If you could arrange to pay me a portion of the Amt due it would aid me just now, as I am really requiring money to meet my engagements -- </p>
<p>I am Yours Very Truly
