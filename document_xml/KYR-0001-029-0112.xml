   <p>Office Chief of Police
<lb/>Louisville Ky <date when="1862-11-10">Nov 10th 1862</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Gov. Robinson
<lb/>Dr Sir.</p>
<p>I have just learned that a petition was about being sent to your Excellency for this pardon of Kaufman Kremer, a notorious old thief. I thought it my duty to inform you of the fact, that he has been up before our Police Court often, charged with Petit Larceny, and was once convicted and sent to the Work House, but by the interposition of Executive Clemency was released from said place. We are troubled a great deal with such characters, and I trust you will not head the petition referred to.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Chas. L. Stancliffe
<lb/>Chief of Police</p>
<p>The foregoing is the copy of your letter now on file in the Executive Office at Frankfort</p>
<p>D C Wickliffe
<lb/>Sec. of State</p>
