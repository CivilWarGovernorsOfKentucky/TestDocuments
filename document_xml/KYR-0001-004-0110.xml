<p>Dear Sir I have learned with suprise and regret that <persName ref="cwgk:N00000330">Mr Franklin Gorin</persName> of Louisville has been indicted for malicious shooting. I have known Mr Gorin all my life, and I think I can say with the utmost confidence that he is not the character of man to be guilty of such an offence Mr Gorin is not the man to bear malice, I know him to be an impulsius man, but of high strung and manly and noble sentiments and sympathies such indeed as adorn human nature. I would most respectfully suggest that his pardon would not militate against the publick interests of the county, but, upon the contrary would be but such an exercise of<pb/>
<lb/>of clemency and mercy as might be well extended to an old man who has acted a faithful post for his country and the best interestes of society. If Mr Gorin has at any time deviated from the character I have given him I feel assured that such deviations have been the result of excitement rather than malice and malevolence</p>
<p>I remain very truly &amp;c
<lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N00001152">John W Ritter</persName></p>
<p>P S. I feel assured that every Union man in this portion of the state would be pleased to know that Mr Gorin was pardoned</p>
