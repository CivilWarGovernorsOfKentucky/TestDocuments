   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thos E. Bramlette
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Samuel Montague would respectfully state, that on the <date when="1864-02-08">8th of February 1864</date> his brother allen Montague was held &amp; confined in the Jail of Jefferson county Kentucky upon a charge of felony, that petitioner went upon the bail bond of said Allen Montague in the sum of $500 <hi rend="sup">00</hi>/<hi rend="sub">00</hi> Judgment was rendered <date when="1864-10-17">Oct 17th 1864.</date></p>
<p>Said Allen Montague was a soldier in Federal army at the time he was bailed, &amp; is in <hi rend="str">the</hi> said army at the present time,</p>
<p>Your petitioner resides in the county of Burbon state of Kentucky &amp; not beeing apprised of what was necessary to be done let judgment go by default, Maj. J. T. Farris of Col Jacobs Regiment was a friend of petitioner &amp; accused &amp; promised that all<pb/>
<lb/>necessary steps should be taken to prevent judgment. petitioner believed that such steps had been taken untill he received notice that Judgment had been rendered. Feeling secure, &amp; confiding in Maj Farris petitioner was not prepared to attend to the case, Had petitioner been correctly informed judgment could have been prevented, by pleading the statute passed by the Legislature <date when="1862-03-11">March 11th 1862;</date> which statute is for the benefit of soldiers in the state of Kentucky &amp; the united states &amp; declars that no forfeitur or Judgment can be had when the party is proven to be in the Military service of the state of Kentucky or the United States. Your petitioner could have made abundant proof that his brother Allen Montague was in the Military Service of the united states, but confiding in Maj Farris he suffered it to pass as above stated.</p>
<p>your petitioner is too poor to pay so large a sum without greatly embarrasing<pb/>
<lb/>himself, &amp; he prays your Excellency to remit the part comming to the commonwealth</p>
<p>S Montague</p>
<p>J. H. Price states on oath that allen Montague the party mentioned in the above petition &amp; bailed by Samuel Montague was in the military service as a soldier when he was bailed, &amp; that he believes that he is in said army at the present time</p>
