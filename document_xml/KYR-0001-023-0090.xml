<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We, the undersigned, committee appointed by the North Ballard Military Company, to inform your Excellency that a few nights ago, a detachment of Abolition troops, numbering some two hundred and over, was sent to our neighborhood by the Commander in Cairo, for the purpose of arresting and holding as prisoners, some ten or twelve gentlemen who had camped in the river bottom for the purpose of fishing and hunting. These gentlemen committeed no crime or violated any law. -- The only offence they can be charged with is, that of being "Southern Rights" men. On their march from the river to the camp they arrested and held as prisoners Several of our citizens, thereby depriving them of their liberty.</p>
<p>These gentlemen left the camp before the detachment reached it.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">We humbly but earnestly ask your Excellency to enforce the position which you have taken in your proclamation.</hi> <hi rend="underline">Our Soil has been invaded by federal troops and we trust your Honor will take Some immediate steps in regard to the matter</hi>.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
