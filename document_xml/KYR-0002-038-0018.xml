<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>The Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir:</p>
<p>I am directed by the Secretary of War, to Communicate to you the decision made in the case of Capt D. C. Stone who was dismissed the service, by sentence fo a General Court Martial, and subsequently applied for permission to re-enter the service as an Officer.</p>
<p>The report of the Judge Advocate General, to whom the case was referred closes with the following Opinion and recommendation: "Upon a careful review of the record of the Court Martial it must be concluded that the sentence pronounced against Capt Stone was not justified by the facts proven. It is quite evident<pb/>
<lb/>also that he has been a signally patriotic, &amp; valuable officer and that as is said of him by Col Taylor 15<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky. Vols." he has been involved in trouble mainly on account of his having been efficient and rigid in the dicipline of his Command": The removal of the disability resting upon him is simply an act of justice; but in restoring him to his rank, it is advised that he be assigned to a battery other than that which he has lately Commanded, on account of the evident feeling of opposition and ill will entertained towards him by the Subalterns of his late Company"</p>
<p>Upon the above report the disability resting upon Captain D. C. Stone is removed, by order of the President, and he may be reCommissioned</p>
<p>I am, Sir
<lb/>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Your Obedient Servant
