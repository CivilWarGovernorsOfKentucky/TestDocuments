   <p>To his Excellency the
<lb/>Hon. Thomas E. Bramlett
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The Undersigned respectfully represent that at the <date when="--09">present September term</date> of the Circuit Court for the County of Kenton Felix Mc Dermott was Indicted, tried and convicted and sentenced to one years confinement in the Penitentiary of this Comlth -- The offense consisted of the stealing of the Pocket Book and some U,S, Treasury notes, the property of James D. Willis -- </p>
<p>Mc Dermott proved on the trial a good character by such gentlemen as John T. Levis, John Noonan &amp; John Ferguson who had known him for many years -- Mc Dermott protests his innocence -- He is apparently about 50 years of age -- a laboring man -- very poor -- and has depending on him a worthy wife and four helpless children<pb/>
<lb/>We think his case is worthy of Executive clemency and recommend him to your Excellency for a full &amp; free pardon</p>

<p>I do not know anything of the facts developed in the evidence although I know Felix M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Dermott &amp; have known him for several years &amp; always regarded him as a simple man. The signatures of the above substantial men of this community I consider as entitled to consideration &amp; thereupon &amp; in consideration of the helpless condition of convicts family &amp; indulging the hope that Executive clemency will not be misplaced in pardoning I join prayer with petitioners</p>
