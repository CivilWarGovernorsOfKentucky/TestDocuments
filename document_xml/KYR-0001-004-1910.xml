  <body>
   <p>To his Excellancy Thos E. Bramlette Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner F. <hi rend="str">M</hi> N. Alexander respectfully begs leave to represent unto your Excellancy that, at the April term of the Wayne Circuit Court <date when="1865">1865</date> on Indictment of the Grand jury of Wayne County was prefered against him accusing him of the crime of murder committed as follows, viz. the Said Frances M. Alexander did on the <date when="1865-03-20">20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> March 1865</date> in the County of Wayne aforesaid, unlawfully, wilfully, feloniously, and with malice aforethought shoot at, and wound with a pistol loaded with a leaden ball. William Frieldze, of which said wounding the said Frieldze then and there did die."</p>
<p>Your petitioner now represents and states, in regard<hi rend="str">s</hi> to the crime with which he stands charged as afs<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> that if he did commit the crime, he did not, neither does he know it, as he has no recolection whatever of having a personal dificulty with any one on that day, neither had he on that day or at any other time any malice or unkind feelings towards the deceased. And if he did fall by the hand of your petitioner (of which he does not know) no one could regret such an event more than he. The exciting circumstances of the rebellion and its fearful consequences, tending to the disolution, and the overthrow of the institutions of his country, in connection with the conflicting and desolating elements which in rapid and mournful succession swept over his native, and beloved State, have Come upon<pb/>
<lb/>his anxious and troubled mind with such force, that many events have transpired in his history during the last four years of his country's trial, which appear to him almost as a dream. He states that he never cultivated a thirst for the blood of his fellow man; but on the contrary, has always endeavored to cultivate kind and friendly feelings towards all persons, and no one could regret doing an act of violence to his fellow man more than he; and could tears of Sympathy bring the deceased back to life again, and restore him to the bosom and embraces of his bereaved and helpless family, whether he fell by the hand of your petitioner or not (of which he does not know) those tears should freely flow down his cheeks from both his streaming eyes. But: alas: the deceased now sleeps in death, while your petitioner is charged with his sad fall. In view of the fact, that any punishment which the laws and civil authorities of his Country might inflict upon him on account of his alleged crime, could not in any wise benefit the silent dead, advance the interest of the living, or restore to the disconsolate Widow and the tender and inocent orphen the one who no doubt was more dear to them than all others beside.</p>
<p>Your petitioner therefore most humbly and respectfully presents his Cause to the consideration and merciful interposition of the chief Executive of his native State; humbly trusting that in the exercise of the functions of your ^Excellencys^ high position, you may feel that the honor and dignity of your State, will not be compromised<pb/>
<lb/>or impaired by granting your humble petitioner such relief as will save him from the mortifying and embarrassing consequences of a further prossecution, and restore to him, all the rights and privileges of an American citizen, which he most ardently desires to maintain by his good and loyal demeanor during the remnant of his days.</p>
<p>Having for four years, underwent the fatigues, dangers, and privations of a Camp life, and having devoted his time and energies, in Common with his fellow Soldiers in his countrys bleeding Cause; nothing could be more highly appreciated by and more greatful to the feeling of your petitioner, than for his humble petition to recieve and meet with the favorable consideration of your Excellancy, and in duty bound he will ever petition and pray.
<lb/><date when="1865-05-03">May 3. 1865</date></p>
<p>To his Excellency Thos E. Bramlette Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of the County of Wayne, having for many years been intimately and well acquainted with Col F. M. Alexander; and having examined his foregoing petition, do in view and in Consideration of the facts and reasons as therein set forth, earnestly appeal to the timely interposition of your Excellancys clemency in his behalf to the extent of the relief prayed for in his petition -- <pb/></p>
