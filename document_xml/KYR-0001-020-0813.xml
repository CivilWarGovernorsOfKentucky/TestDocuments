<lb/>Governor Magoffin
<lb/>My Dear Sir</p>
<p>I write in behalf of James and Thomas Fitsgerald who have been convicted at <unclear/> <unclear/> term of our Court for shooting without doing injury and ordered to six months confinement in the County Jail and to pay $100 apiece I ^do not^ believe that they shot at all. They were trying to dispossess a tenant and undetook to force their way into the house in order to serve a notice, and behaved badly and have been punished a good deal already and ought to pay $50 each, of the fines. Upon a subsiquent trial of an Indictment against one of them for carrying the pistol, the other testified against the two witnesses of the Commonwealth, and the Jury could not agree. I am not in the habit of signing petitions to your Excellency, and would not write this, if I did not sincerely believe, that those men were no further guilty than as above suggested. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Arthur, who has conduced to discontinue the case in which the Jury disagreed, will add a postscript.</p>
<p>Very Resptflly
<lb/><hi rend="underline">J. W. Menzies</hi></p>
<p>P. S. accompanying this is a statement of Jurymen</p>
<p>J. W. M.</p>
<p><note place="left margin">I send you one of the shot which was said to have been sent by the pistol through a pane of glass and lodged within 2 feet of the window on a table</note><pb/></p>
<p>I am of the opinion that the fine is sufficient punishment and that the imprisonment might properly be discharged. Mr Menzies is mistaken in his statement in the foregoing petition that I have concluded to discontinue the Indictment against one of the Defendants as to which a Jury disagreed, I have, however, that step under advisement -- this note is written at the request of Mr Menzies</p>
<p>W. E. Arthur
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Atty for Com'th</hi></p>
<p>Since writing the foregoing, I have seen eight of the Jurors -- 4 of whom wished the imprisonment and half the fines taken and 4 were for retaining the whole of the fines. The other 4 I could not see conveniently and did not see them. I will remark here, that men were fined ten dollars each for injuring property, that is breaking the pane of glass. They are worth worth nothing but <hi rend="underline">17</hi> acres of land 3 <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">2</hi> miles from Covington= $1200. subject to a bona fide mortgage of about $800, and a note on a good man for $200, I believe that they are honest men.</p>
<p>Resptflly
<lb/><hi rend="underline">J. W. Menzies</hi><pb/></p>
<p>I cheerfully concur in the foregoing petition I heard the testimony about the shot</p>
