   <p>Dixon Ky. <date when="1863-04-16">April 16<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi>/63</date>
<lb/>Hon. Jas. F. Robinson Governor of the Commonwealth of Ky.</p>
<p>Dear Sir some weeks since I had the honor to transmit to your excelency a petition signed ^by^ upwards of a 100 of the citizens of Webster county praying the remission of a fine of 20<hi rend="underline">00</hi> Dollars Vs. one Micages Cobbs for selling Liquor without a licens therefor -- The facts are these Cobb <hi rend="str">is</hi> ^was^ a very poor illiterate man having a large and helpless family to support as he says and as I verily believe <hi rend="str">(that)</hi> ^he^ being in ill health and that in -- order to procure necessaries for himself and family he<pb/>
<lb/>had ^concluded^ that in or to do so (if it would not be a violation of law) he would procure some the lawful article &amp; take to a role in his neighbourhood that he might sell the same at a profit &amp; by that means procure the articles necessary for the subsistence of his family -- &amp; being an illiterate &amp; ignorant man he consulted one John H. Bumpass a Justice of the peace in &amp; for <hi rend="str">the</hi>Webster county &amp; also N, N, Johnson the then sheriff of said county by both of whom he was informed that it would be no violation of law, Relying upon their counsel and advice he went to the sale in honest faith taking with him his Jugg of whiskey when he traficed &amp; distributed<pb/>
<lb/>the same for which act he was indicted and fined the above named sum of twenty Dollars. It <hi rend="str">seems to</hi> appears from the whole premises that Cobb acted in honest faith believing that he was violating no law &amp; commiting no wrong and that in sd doing he acted under the false and misguided instructions of Bumpass &amp; Johnson both of whom were officers of the law -- from my own knowledge of the facts it seems to me from the whole premises that it is a case in <hi rend="str">which</hi> which the Executive clemency <hi rend="str">mercy with,</hi> ^would be^ propriety and justiily as excercised</p>
<p>Fondly hoping that your Excelency upon a due consideration of the foregoing<pb/>
<lb/>premises will take such action therein as is just &amp; proper to him who has <unclear/> action <hi rend="underline">but</hi> <hi rend="underline">not</hi> <hi rend="underline">in</hi> <hi rend="underline">heart</hi> or intention -- I have the honor to remain with sentiments of high regard &amp; esteem</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Your ob<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> serv<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi>
<lb/>John F. Galbraith</p>
