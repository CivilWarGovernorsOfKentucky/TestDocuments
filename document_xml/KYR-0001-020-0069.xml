<lb/>Caldwell County</p>
<p>Affiant William French says he is well acquainted with the general moral character of James Blalock who testifed on behalf of the Commonwealth against Thomas B. Wadlington, and that from that character and his own knowledge of the man himself he would not believe him on oath in a court of justice -- He states that he does not believe said Blalock testified truely in said cause for the reason that since the trial of said cause he has heard said Blalock state that Cartwright shot first, instead of Wadlington, and that on the trial of said cause he swore that Wadlington fired first -- He says that he has lived a number of years a near neighbor of said Blalock, and Known ^him^ well -- He says he has known Tho B. Wadlington a number of years, and he has ever been considered an honest industrious and good citizen -- </p>
