<lb/>Gov. Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We would most respectfully state that from applications made from various parts of Ky. and on the part of <hi rend="underline">Union</hi> <hi rend="underline">Men</hi> the removal of Brig. Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Boyle from his present position is altogether desirable and absolutely demanded. We have understood that you asked that he might be retained in his present position -- We therefore address you this letter asking that you will under all the circumstances, which no doubt have come to your knowledge consent that he may be ordered to the front and an other man who will reflect the real Union sentiment of the people of Ky. be put in his place.</p>
<p>We know &amp; feel that the position assumed by Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Boyle is &amp; has been a<pb/>
<lb/>draw back to the real Union sentiment of our state, &amp; we propose to relieve ourselves of that impediment as soon as possible -- As you had asked of the Department here his retention then, we felt it <unclear/> to you as the Gov. of our state that we should consult with, &amp; obtain your assent to the work we intended to undertake -- We do not desire to bring you into this matter, but merely to obtain from you a statement that you could not and would not undertake to interfere with the action of the War Dept. in regard to who should command in Ky -- </p>
<p>We hope you will properly appreciate our motives and give us a speedy reply -- </p>
<p>We are your friends and obt. srt<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi>
<lb/>G. Clay Smith
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Lucian</hi> <hi rend="underline">Anderson</hi>
<lb/>W. H Randall <pb/></p>
<p>P. S. </p>
<p>The Hon. Brutus G. Clay is not here, but we are assured he concurs with us. We have a letter from him freely endorsing what we are doing -- &amp; he absolutely requires action in This case as we suggest -- </p>
<p>G. C. S.
