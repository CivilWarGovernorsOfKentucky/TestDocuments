<lb/>Gov of Kentucky </p>
<p>Your petitioner would state that some time in the year <date when="1860">1860</date> -- he got on a little bender as is said and happened to be seen and heard by one "Johnson Adams" a Justice of the peace in and for Magoffin County and that said Johnson Adams without process or ceremony fined your petitioner $2.50 fine 120 ^cost^ wherefore he asks your excellency to remit the said fine, as he seldom drinks too much and does not swear often -- that the said Adams has taken peculiar delight to exercise his high prerogative, over a class of poor men in this county and has sought to oppress many, Wherefore he prays for Executive Clemency
