<lb/>To his Exellency E. Bramlette
<lb/>Gov. of the St. of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned witnesses, for the commonwealth of Kentucky against R. Henry Smith, who was yesterday sentenced to one years Penitentiary, state that the Petition for his Pardon, contains Statements contrarey to the facts. first, Smith was no more Drunk, when he left the House as he was, when he entered it. When first accused, of having taken varies Goods, to the amount of $20. twenty Dollars, he denied, ^of^ having takin any thing, but after bieng prest some &amp; finding that there was no ground left to retreat.<pb/>
<lb/>upon, he acknowledged the Charge, and returned about four Dollars &amp; fifty cents worth of the Goods; he denies, of having taken any Pips, but it was proved befor the Court that he Sliped one worth 75 cts in the Pocket of Mr. Hughs. Allso the Statement, that the Prosecution, was brought by Mr F. Rothenhofer for the purpose, of compelling hime to pay a existing account, is equaly false, as Mr. F. Rothenhofer was absent from the City, while this trancespired, and said R. H. Smith was arrested, before Rothenhofer got home.</p>
<p>We the undersigned, do earnestly belive, that the convicktet R. H. Smith, has allready<pb/>
<lb/>suffered hard enough for his offence and we humble ask of Your Exellence to Pardon him on this Ground, but we cannot permit a Petition containing Statements so palpably contrary <hi rend="str">the</hi> to the Evidence to go before Your Exellency, with out our Protest</p>
<p>Yours most obedient and very humble Servands
<lb/>Ferd: Rothenhofer
<lb/>G. F. Lilley</p>
