<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Some two years ago a man by the name of John Perringer came to me &amp; demanded a Peace Warrent against John Reester for having made some threats that he intended to whip Perringer the warrent was granted &amp; the parties were before me in order to settle the matter as is my custom I bound Reester over to keep the peace in the sum of one hundred dollas I believe &amp; to appear at the next Equity &amp; Criminal Court, at which time S. L. Kohn an honest Old duchman all ways ready to releave the distressed steped forward &amp; went Reesters security, in a very short time afterwards Reester left this place &amp; went to Louisville or some where in that region of country &amp; I have understood died when the court came on &amp; Reester having died the Old man Kohn did not think he had aney thing further to do &amp; consqutley did not make his appearance in court, &amp; the result was a fine; there was a petition sent up to your Honor some twelve months ago asking you to remit the fine as it stood against the Old man Kohn &amp; you was pleased to respite the fine for 12 months he paying the cost which he has done I do think sir if ever your Excellency had a case presented that demanded your kind attention this is one of that class I do hope sir that your kind &amp; benevolent hart will ^be^ prompted to releave this kind harted Old man from the payment of the above named fine</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
