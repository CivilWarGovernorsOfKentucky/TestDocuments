<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir</p>
<p>I take the liberty of enclosing to you a petition to the Governor, which <hi rend="str">I will</hi> you will please present to him -- I would not trouble you, but you are acquainted with a number of the persons whose signatures are attached to the petition -- The person named in the petition is a nephew of mine and I am well acquainted with all the circumstances connected with the case, and am well satisfied that the verdict of the Jury was an improper one -- The Jury were out two days before they could agree and four of them would never have agreed to the verdict but they were informed by the foreman or some one of the jury, that the lawyer for Thornton would take an appeal &amp; that it did not matter much which way they decided at that time. -- </p>
<p>Very truly your
<lb/>friend &amp; obt Svt<hi rend="underline">
