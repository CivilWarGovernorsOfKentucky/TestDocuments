<p>Ja<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. Stuart Judge</p>
<p>To the Governor of the Comlth. of Ky Your Petitioner Robert Lewis states he is the father of L. C. Lewis who stands Indicted in the Breckenridge Circuit Court. for shooting at M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. George P. Paul</p>
<p>He says his son is young and has no means to provide for his<pb/>
<lb/>defense so it falls upon this Petitioner His son was admitted to Bail by the Circuit Court in the sum of $200. which your Petitioner borrowed and deposited in lieu of Bail</p>
<p>He says he has in the Course of this summer been stripped of his property by Guerillas and that they threatened to kill him and so fearful is he that the would execute the threat that he abandoned his home &amp; business and has dodged from one point to another to avoid them -- and now he dare not travel from his home to the Court. or elsewhere to prepare his sons defense, and his son has been driven from home by the Guerillas &amp; is now in the state of Indiana in fact this Petitioner has been compelled to flee to said State with his whole family, and he knows not but that the Bail will have to be forfeited for the non appearance of his son, for if the Court sits for the approaching Term he cannot risk attending it<pb/></p>
<p>It will be impossible for the witnesses on either side to appear. which will result in the prosecution standing over Mr. Paul the prosecutor has also been driven from his home by Guerillas, and he is satisfied cannot in any safety attend the Court to testify -- He is informed that Mr. Paul is also willing the prosecution may end, seeing that it is so oppressive to your Petitioner and from the troubles of the times may not be tried for an indefinite period, and the inability of this Petitioner to refund the money he borrowed for Bail in consequence of his broken up Condition, will not your Excellency pardon his son, especially as no injury was done Mr. Paul.</p>

<p>J. Stuart Judge</p>
<p>George P. Paul states he is the person shot at by L. C. Lewis, He is willing that young Mr. Lewis may be pardoned by the Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. He cannot as he verily<pb/>
<lb/>believes safely attend Court as a witness and the further prosecution of the Indictment will be very burdensome to all concerned</p>

<p>Isaac, H, Booker J, P ,m, c</p>
<p>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Bramlette I hope you will let this young man off. Many of our citizens have been driven from home by Marauders, some have staid &amp; fought them, some have been killed by them and some of us have killed them and if heaven smiles upon us we will kill out the entire race, in the Course of time, mean time no honest man can look to business here I may attempt to hold the Breckenridge Court. but if I should it will be a merely formal Term, should you pardon Lewis enclose the Document to the clerk of the Breckenridge Circuit Court</p>
<p>This old man Lewis has been cleaned out &amp; driven to Indiana</p>
