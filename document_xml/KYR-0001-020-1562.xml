<p>Dear Sir I have seen the Governor but on account of the lateness of the hour was debared the opportunity of conversing with him I am greatly disappointed in my expectations, and on account of the great accumulation of business on his hands at this time I take occasion to write to you The Governor is doubtless the verry man the people would desire to fill that high and responsible office There is no human being on earth possessed of sufficient ^wisdom^ and penetration, not to be deceived by the artifices and deception of dishonest and cunning people his excellency I discover plainly has been deceived by the number of signers to the tatribolical instrument called a remonstrance, and by letters which he has received from some to my unknown persons as to the letters I would venture I could return I could come verry near guessing their authors, if I could see them I could easily tell whether they were written by their reputed authors or not But one thing I can say they were not written by the dictates of Justice or humanity But from the impluse of enmity and revenge and by persons who Knew nothing of the unfortunate affair It is an absolute fact that those who signed the remonstrance did <pb/>
<lb/>not sign it for the purpose of injuring Charles, but to testify to the uprightness of Thomas Estes character, which they were told was grossly assailed in the petition which was utterly false verry few of the signers Knew any thing of the affair and those who did are destitute of truth or principle I could tell every considerate man who signed it by his countenance without being told, many spoke of going to Frankfort have their names taken off, and transfering them to the other paper, but I suppose neglicted it There are such a number of relatives that there ^were^ feared by the little office seekers, store keepers, and, grocers and their influence are against us</p>
<p>It is certainly a great misfortune to the country, that party influences are often brought to bear, so as to prevent the accomplishment of justice, particullarly in criminal cases, and a greater pity still, that such men as Josef Yates and two or three others, of alike ilk are capable of producing the almost unparallelled excitement that they caused in this neighborhood, by working on the minds ^of^ the relations, and those who came to take Charles, the tale had gone forth that the poor fellow was called out from his supper table and shot down in cold blood<pb/>
<lb/>without cause or provocation, Yates and the others refered to, had sworn against my character in a certain slander suit which terminated in the Franklin circuit court, and was compelled to swear the defendant Martin J Sebree to be a crazy man, and after all their trouble was defeated. They were impelled by feelings of enmity originating from political differences, and it was Known the object was to curtail my limited influence, consequently I was aimed at in a pecuniary point of view as well as in character Thomas Estes was one who swore to my good Charater in said suit, and ever after remembered it in the most substantional manner The above names individuals Knowing that I was the only human being that was presant and had knowledge of the unfortunate occurrance, and finding my statement would shew the affair in a verry different light from from the representations of those who Knew nothing about it, the reckless unprincipled and unscrupulous rabble tatlers and gossips found a little season that they would be listened to and made good use of their time and then slanders and lies was given as my character, when they knew the object to be, to take away the life of a fellow creature The course was pursued<pb/>
<lb/>in order to take vengeance on me for their failure in the slander case, and to place me where they had so long desired and a reason I think, why<hi rend="str">ich</hi> his excellency would do right to interpose the pardoning prerogative, and in his wisdom and clemency give Charles his liberty</p>
<p>The two personages who boasted themselves the most conspicuous in getting signers to the remonstrance, was Baker and Batman two notorious pluguglies Baker is a Franklin bully receiving a regular annuity from the Frankfort Click for his bullying services and Batman a Louisville plugugly who figured in the mob of murdering and house burning memory, and was wounded, and carries the Irish bullet in his heel I do not know whether he is placed on the invalid pension list or not</p>
<p>I confess myself to be extremely ignorant, professing to Know nothing but truth and honestly I relied on evidence and not signers, and cannot for my life see why the Governor would not be justified in releasing my unfortunate Brother upon the evidence before him with respect I remain your obedient servant</p>
