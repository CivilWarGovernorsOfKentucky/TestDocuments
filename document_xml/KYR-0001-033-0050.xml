<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>As Judge of the Christian County Court I certify that John Litchfield late of Christian County Ky ruthlessly &amp; without cause or provocation shot stabed &amp; murdered in this County John Cotton on Thursday the <date when="1863-06-25">25 day of June 1863</date> &amp; is now running at large in the community Said John Litchfield has also threatened to kill several other good citizens in the same neighborhood From representations made to me &amp; from my own knowledge, I have no hesitation in saying that said Litchfield is a very reckless dangerous man &amp; it is quite likely will if not arrested carry his threats into execution A Large number or at least a great many of the citizens of that portion of the county for several days past have quit their regular avocations &amp; kept up a general search for him It is confidently belived that he is yet in the County He is a diserter from the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Vols &amp; a complete outlaw. It is the desire of this community that you offer a reward of from $250,00 to $500, for his apprehension It is believed he is harboured by persons who for the reward would betray him Given under my hand this <date when="1863-07-02">July 2 1863</date></p>
