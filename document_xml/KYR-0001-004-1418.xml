   <p>Honorable Thomas E. Bramlett,
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your petitioner Joseph Hemming would respectfully petition and represent unto you, that in the <date when="1864-05-17">17 day of May 1864</date> there was a judgment rendered against him by the city Court of Louisville for $1000~ for the charge of keeping a <hi rend="str">tipling</hi> disorderly house ~ that an execution issued upon said judgment and he by great pressure and deprivation of himself and family was compelled and did pay the sum of $51.50, being the fees and costs of the suit, leaving yet unpaid the remainder, which belongs to the Commonwealth; and that same has been levied on a small house and lot ^on^ which he and his family now live. He states that said suit was one of aggravation and malice and done and prosecuted solely with a view to oppress him. He states that he has been sick for more than eight months last past, and wholly unable to do any labor of any kind, for the support of himself or family ~ He states that he is poor and has a family to support, and no means of supporting them ~ He states that he is wholly unable to<pb/>
<lb/>support them, and is wholly unable to pay said execution, and if prosecuted and said house sold, he and his helpless family will be left without any shelter, but will be thrown into the street without support. He prays Your Honor to remit said fine.</p>
<p>Joseph Henin</p>
<p>Sworn to before me this <date when="1865-01-26">26 day of January 1865</date></p>

<p>We the undersigned petitioners would represent that we are acquainted with the petitioner Joseph Hemming, and that we fully endorse the statements contained in the foregoing petition -- That said petitioner is a poor man, with a helpless family, and that he has been sick for a long time and unable to work for their support and that if said house is sold, he and his family would be left in the streets and without a home. We believe the prosecution in said case was done with malice, -- We know said petitioner to be a quiet and unoffending citizen, and do not believe he has any time kept a disorderly<pb/>
<lb/>house. We join with him in his prayer that said fine may be remitted</p>
