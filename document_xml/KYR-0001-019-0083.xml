Half of the usual price for transmission will be charged for repeating the message; and while this Comapny will, as heretofore, use every precaution to ensure correctness, it will not be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission of delivery of repeated messages, beyond an amount exceeding five hundred times the amount paid for sending the message; nor will it be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission of unrepeated messages from whatever cause they may arise, nor for delays arising in interruptions in the working of Telegraphs, nor for any mistake or omission of any other Company, over whose lines a message is to be sent to reach the place of destination. All messages will hereafter be received by this Company for transmission, subject to the above conditions.</p>
