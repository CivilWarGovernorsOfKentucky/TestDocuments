<lb/>To G, L, Forman &amp; H. Taylor
<lb/>Dear Sirs</p>
<p>Since I Saw you, your Brother Samuel told me that he met with Mr John Norris at the Louisville Convention, who told him that he was in the Battle on Lake Eerie, and was near me when I was wounded, There ware two of the Norris' in our company John and Joseph, boath clever fellows,</p>
<p>John is now living in Boon County Kentucky, I have written to him today and enquired after his Brother Joseph,</p>
<p>When making the appropriation for the medals you can make It Large enough to cover the expence of at <hi rend="underline">Least</hi> <hi rend="underline">Four</hi> for the folowing Names James Artey ^Sergeant^ <hi rend="str">Seargent</hi> <hi rend="str">Wm</hi> <hi rend="str">J.</hi> <hi rend="str">Tali</hi> William T, Taliaferro ^corporal^ of Cincinnati, John Tucker Private Brown county Ohio and John Norris Boon County Kentucky<pb/></p>
<p>I have not heard anything from you yet. But hope when I do, that I may hear that Kentucky is for the <hi rend="underline">Union</hi> the <hi rend="underline">Constitution</hi> and the <hi rend="underline">Laws</hi> and will continue this, till the <hi rend="underline">Last</hi> <hi rend="underline">Hope</hi> has failed, and there is no Union to cling to, And then <hi rend="str">there</hi> She may not be in a hurry to joine any confederacy, till She finds an other Government equal to the present, where She will have equal Rights, or remain Independent under her own Government,</p>
<p>we have had no exciting news sence Saturday,</p>
<p>Your Truely
<lb/>James Artey</p>
<p>I have Given you the present residence of the 4 Surviving Volunteers.</p>
