   <p>State of Ky
<lb/>Harrison County.</p>
<p>E. H. Wilson, states that in the month of <date when="1860-05">May 1860</date>, one F M Varner was arrested in Cynthiana, charged with passing Counterfeit money, and affiant in connection with Noah Varner (the father of F M Varner) became sureties in two Bonds for his appearance at the <date when="1860-11">November Term 1860</date> of the Harrsion Circuit Court to answer said charge. One of the Bonds was for $500 and the other for $1000, He states that he was induced to Sign said Bonds, from the reason that F M Varner was his nephew ^by marriage^ and he was arrested in Cynthiana, where affiant happened to be on business, and affiant believed from his representatons and those of his father that he was innocent, and that he would stand his trial, where his innocence would be manifested, The said F M Varner promised affiant that he would appear and stand his trial, and did stay in the County of Nicholas ^(Varner went off shortly after the Bonds were executed, but returned in <date when="1860-08">august</date>)^ until within a few days of the <date when="1860-11">November Term 1860</date> of the Harrison Circuit Court, when unknown to affiant and contrary to his expectation, the Said F, M, Varner, ran off<pb/>
<lb/>and left the State of Ky, and is now at large -- Affiant States that he is a very poor man, being the owner of only a small farm in Nicholas County -- that his whole Estate is not worth over $1200 -- and that if he be compelled to pay off said Bonds it will completely ruin and break him up, He makes his affidavit, for the purpose of procurring from the Governor a remission of said Bonds, on such clemency, as his Excellency may think it right to bestow in his cases,</p>
<p>E H Wilson</p>
