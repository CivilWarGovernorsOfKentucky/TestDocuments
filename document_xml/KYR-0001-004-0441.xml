   <p>Louisville Ky. <date when="1864-01-25">Jan. 25<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> 1864</date>
<lb/>Gov. Bramlett</p>
<p>You ar doubtless importuned and asked very frequently to Pardon men out of the penitentiary. So much So that I fear that I will be considered an intruder or tresspasser upon your valueable time. But believeing in the justness of my cause and having an abiding confidence in your integrity and Patriotism I appeal with confidence and trust that he that ruleth and controlls all things will enable you to See that my poor unfortunate <hi rend="underline">Husband</hi> is a fit Subject for Executive Clemency.</p>
<p>My Husband W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Banks and his companion in arms ^John M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Clure^ were sentenced to the State Prison upon the charge of having received Some tobacco which afterwards turned out to ^have^ been Stolen, now I will tell you the truth about that matter, about dusk one evening three large Size boys come to our place and Seeing that, my husband &amp; McClure were Soldiers, Solisited them to buy some tobacco from them Saying that we will Sell cheaper than you can buy elsewhere.<pb/>
<lb/>my husband asked them where they got tobacco they unhesitatingly Said their Employer at the factory had given it to them for work which they had done in the factory. So my husband not dreaming of doing any wrong and certainly apprehending no wrong intent upon the part of Boys, did buy the tobacco from them. So I tell you of a truth <hi rend="str">the</hi> and in view of my future destiny, that the tobacco was bough in good faith and believing that the Boys had told us the truth -- these Boys look dirty just as if though they had come out of a tobacco factory, let me assure you that the Streets of this city are full of men Woman Boys &amp; children, who are importuning the Soldiers upon all hands to buy from them various articles Such as tobacco cigars Tack, fruits &amp;c. the soldier never thinks no it never enters his mind that these may have been stolen, he Simply Sees the article and if it Suits him he buys it never dreaming by So doing that he had committed a wrong, my Husband was only a common Soldier his pay as you know was only $13, per month -- which was not enough to support us.<pb/>
<lb/>the duties which he had to perform were that of being guard at Barracks no 1. So his times was not occupied all the time, So he would Sell various articles of necesities to Soldiers at the Barrack and Hospitals, Such as fruits tobacco and cigars the profits of which in addition to his regular pay enabled us to live tolerably comfortable, But when he got these two packages of tobacco from the Boys, he though he would Sell it at wholesale. hence he offered it ^to^ the grocerymen Saying to the groceryman to Say nothing about it, the reason that he wished him to keep it a Secrect was that he knew that the Police would arrest him for Pedling without licens if they became conizant of the fact, So doing Such a small business he could not afford to take out license hence they requested Secrecy.</p>
<p>My Husband has Served nearly three years in the army has gone through the perils and hardships of a Soldiers life, without a murmer, and this is the only blot upon his fair escutcheon either civil or military<pb/></p>
<p>But this this dark Spot is upon his heretofore fair character, it must be Blotted out. (provided your excellency will grant the privilege) by enlisting as a veteran in the army of my country, and by valor upon the ensanguine fields of death &amp; carnage, I, pray God you will grant him this privilege</p>
<p>I could urge matters touching your Sympathy. Such as poverty destitution and misery which would ensue provided my <hi rend="underline">husband</hi> was deprived the privilege of contributing to my Support, but I Scorn to do it because I am the wife of a true patriot and a Soldier, and I believe in the justness of my cause, and have the, proud conciousness of knowing that my husband is inocent, though a combination of circumstances induced the jury to think otherwise,,&amp; c.</p>
<p><hi rend="str">With I</hi> With Deep feelings of Solisitude I await your response;</p>
<p>Merie G Banks</p>
