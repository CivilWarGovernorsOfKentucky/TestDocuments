   <p>To His Excellency the Gov</p>
<p>Ashby was convicted for Manslaughter and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment in the penitentiary to hard labor He killed George Gossage near his (Ashbys) own house with a gun obtained in the house: at the time of the killing Gossage interferring in a difficulty then going in between Ashby &amp; his wife: The evidence showed that Ashby believed that Gossage was too intimate with his wife and in sudden heat He slew Gossage; guided by that belief and the offensive language that Gossage used to him at the time: the shot was fired across a fence and there was some contradictory proof as to whether at the time of the shooting Gossage was not in the act of climbing over the fence to attack Ashby: Ashby was proven to have been <unclear/> in the county and to have an unusual character, for bravery and honor and from <unclear/> in his dealings he was tried at a Term of the Court when the community was much excited about the great number of homicides that had then recently been committed and I cannot but believe that the press and public excitement generally affected his case from the number of names appended by his neighbors and friends in the vicinity in which he has<pb/>
<lb/>lived for many years and when his wife &amp; family now reside the law having been indicated and his punishment having been very great in the Jail &amp; penitentiary I join in his recommendation for executive clemency</p>
<p>Respectfuly
<lb/>E S Curry</p>
<p>I was one of the counsel for Ashby &amp; as such feel prepossed in his favor; I cordially concur in the petition for his pardon -- </p>
<p>James Speed</p>
<p>I hope the pardon prayed for may be granted</p>
