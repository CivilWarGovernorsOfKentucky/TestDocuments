<lb/>To B Magoffin Gov of Ky
<lb/>Dr Sir</p>
<p>At the request of the mother of H Alexander I saw the man he was said to have stabbed some two weeks after the stabbing I did not think they ware at first dangerous and at the time I saw him he was nearly well</p>
<p>I have never heard any thing of H Alexanders character but what was good his Parents I have known for ten years they are very poor but honest I think Hyram Alexanders case is a fit one for clemency even if he was guilty which I do not think from all I have heard is so</p>
<p>Very Truly your Hum Servant
