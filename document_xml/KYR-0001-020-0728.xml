<p>Som 12 months since E Vinson Jr a citizen of our Town, having been previously indicted for giving spirituous liquors to a slave, came into court &amp; plead guilty. &amp; accordingly Judgment rendered against him for a fine of Fifty dollars I am informed that the liquor was given to the slave man circumstances Altogether excusable but for the fact that it is <unclear>malu</unclear> prohibited &amp; it was not done with an intention of violating the law, indeed the inhibition was not thought of at the time, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Vinson has a large family of young children and makes his living as a mechanic or house=builder and an upright moral and good citizen <unclear/> not I am satisfied wifully to violate the law. He is very poor &amp; his daily labour is consumed by the actual wants necessities of his family. I believe it a case in which greatly <unclear/> good would be effected in remitting than in enforcing its collection &amp; I hope your Excellency will take his case into kind consideration &amp; remit the sum vs him. I am sure he will not again be guilty of the like offense</p>
<p>I am Truly
<lb/>Your Obt Servt
