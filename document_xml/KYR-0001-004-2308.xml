   <p>To His Excellency Thomas E Bramlette
<lb/>Govenor of the State of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned would humbly represent to your Excellency That at the <date when="--09">September</date> Term of the City Court of Louisville. She was in the Evidence of two watchmen alone indicted and fined excessively in the Sum of $800.<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> being accused of Keeping a disorderly house:</p>
<p>She states that said Watchmen, bear her malice, simply because they desired to act in her house as they pleased against which your petitioner protested and they went off to the Grand Jury and indicted her by a name unknown to her as her name; They made statements wide of the Truth before the Jury her name is Clarinda Razure. Yet they indicted her by the name of (Julia Dean);</p>
<p>She states that her three sons have just come home, having been in the army of this Country fighting, to put down the Rebellion, and to maintain its liberties; they are now with her, and She only has a small house, scarce of sufficient value to pay the state the $800. together with the costs collected by the officers of the city Court in cases of this kind, and if it is subjected to payment of this fine due to the state It will turn her out in the world homeless and penniless; not one of the neighbors, have ever, or now complained of her house; and she insists to your Excellency that if she had permitted the watchmen to have their way in her house; all would have been well<pb/>
<lb/>and they would have shielded and protected her house as they are doing in reference to many others;</p>
<p>She most humbly asks your Excellency to interpose Your Executive clemency and save her from utter ruin and destruction; and will ever pray &amp;c</p>
<p>Clarinda Razure</p>
<p>State of Kentucky
