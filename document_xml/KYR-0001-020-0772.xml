<lb/>To His Excellency B Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of Ky,
<lb/>Dear Sir'</p>
<p>At the present term of the Kenton Circuit Court, an old and hitherto highly respected citisen of this county named Joseph Temple has been convicted of <hi rend="underline">perjury</hi> and by the verdict of Jury is to serve 2 years in the state Penetentiary. He is a man 63 years of age and has been convicted of perjury in a cause which was tried before me acting as Presiding Judge of the Kenton Quarterly Court. I may say that it has never appeared probable to me that he was wilfully guilty<pb/>
<lb/>and although I seldom feel authorised to sign a petition for the interfereance of Executive clemency, still in this case I really feel it my duty to do as I now propose heartily recommend an immediate pardon.</p>
<p>Yours truly
<lb/>C. W <unclear>Woods</unclear></p>
