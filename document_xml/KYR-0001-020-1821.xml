<p>I was Atty for the Commonwealth at the time the Judgt was rendered on the within forfeited Recognizance and think you ought to remit that portion of Judgt to which the Comlth is intitled -- Waggoner is a poor man and a good Citizen and to pay that amt would now break him nearly up and leave his family almost pennyless</p>
