   <p>To his Excellency Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Robinson. Your petitioner Lawson Webster States that on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this month in his own room he with three friends played a small game of Boston at which money was bet &amp; lost but not so much as ten dollars was lost or won during the evening. It was more for amusement than profit. Your petitioner was called before the Grand Jury of the City Court of Lexington and in ignorance of his own rights has compelled to swear to the facts on which the indictment was based. But for this wrong, there would have been most probably no no Indictment. He was tried to-day in the City Court and Consented that the Court might render judgment against him for Two hundred dollars. He has paid the Atty his fee of Sixty dollars and will have to pay the other officers their fees. He thinks the amount paid &amp; to be paid the officers a large penalty for the offense wherefore he &amp; the subscribers as your Excedllency to remit the judgment except the portion to which the Atty is entitled &amp; has rec<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> and the costs.</p>
