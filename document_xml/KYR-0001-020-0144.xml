Mansfield at the <date when="1860-07">July Term 1860</date> of the Equity &amp; Criminal Court of Logan County -- His son was charged with Rape -- He failed to appear and the Recognizance is Forfeited -- There is ^<hi rend="underline">no</hi>^ "<hi rend="underline">Stir</hi>" about the matter not even enough to inquire where the fellow is -- I want you to Remit the Forfeiture so far as Jesse Mansfield is Concerned -- It will ruin the old man if it is not remitted -- The old man stood by his Son as he ought to have done but the Son did not Stand by him This is the first favour I have asked and I would not ask this if I did not believe you will ^be^ justified by all the fathers of the Land in remitting it -- Send the Remission to me -- </p>
