<lb/>Govenor Magoffin</p>
<p>Dear Sir -- As you are aware, at the last term of the Warren Criminal and Equity Court Ruffus Jones was sentenced to <hi rend="str">F</hi>four years imprisonment in the state penitentiary for the Killing of Henry Jenkins, his cousin -- The circumstances &amp; the evidence in the cause have I suppose been told you, I expected to have written a letter to you some time since by Mr Garrett of this place who visited Frankfort, but engagements at the time of his leaving prevented me. From the prominent features of the<pb/>
<lb/>testimony as developed in the trail, the prevelent sentiment of the neighborhood of the transaction, &amp; the relationship of the parties, it is evidently a case claiming peculiarly the exercise of executive Clemency -- There is no doubt that the jury in the rigid execution of the law discharged their duty, but now that they are relieved of the strinnancy of their oath thay are ready and willing to favor the repreve of this unfortunate young man, Judge Chas Green before whom the case was tried likewise sympathizes with them in his behalf</p>
<p>Such favorable action as you may find disposed to grant conistant with your official position, will receive the approval of these familiar with<pb/>
<lb/>the case &amp; will be greatfully remembered by your friends in this community. </p>
<p>Indulging the hope that your action in the premises may not be unfavorable to their wishes</p>
<p>I remain ever
<lb/>Your obedient Srvt
<lb/>Henry H. Stites</p>
<p>To 
<lb/>His Excellency Beriah Magoffin</p>
