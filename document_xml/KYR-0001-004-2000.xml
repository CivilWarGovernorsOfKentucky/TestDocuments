   <p>We the undersigned Jurors who tried the cause of the Commonwealth Against Huston Griffey. would respectfully petition your Excellency. for a remission of all that portion of a fine of $50<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> this Day assessed Against Said Griffey. ^as can be Done^ for Thrusting a pitchfork. at John Archy. The facts are about. these -- in December last Griffey &amp; Archey had made Some Arangement. to Get John Kounst who was the owner. of a wheat Thresher to Get out their wheat -- &amp; they Archy &amp; Griffey had Some Misunderstanding, in regard to a few Bushels of wheat. &amp; Griffy <hi rend="str">ind</hi> inadvertently pushed his pitchfork at Archey -- and inflicted a small flesh wound in Archeys Arm. &amp; Side -- But Did not prevent him from working Every Day -- ^more or less^ the proof is that not a Days work was lost by the wound -- and that the parties worked on together the next Day in Geting out<pb/>
<lb/>wheat. The parties are both Orderly and law-abiding men &amp; we Recomend him. (Griffey) as a fit Subject for Executive Clemency. &amp; therefore pray that the fine be remited. as Griffey is a very poor man. with a large Family of little Children.</p>
