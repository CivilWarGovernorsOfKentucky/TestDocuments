<lb/>The Hon.<hi rend="sup">ble</hi>
<lb/>The Secretary of State &amp;c.</p>
<p>Very illustrious Sir, Having been appointed by His Excellency the Governor of Kentucky by commission bearing date <date when="1859-09-20">20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Sept<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. 1859</date>, a Commissioner of Deeds for that State in this city; which expired in the month of <date when="1863-09">Sept<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 1863</date>; I am desirous, if possible, to be reappointed, as I have been Commissioner for other States and Territories several years; my application would have been made earlier, but I had to travel the continent ^of Europe^ for restoration of my health. -- </p>
<p>I will therefore, consider it a high personal favor, if you will have the goodness to lay my application before His Excellency the Governor of Kentucky; and when you write, should a Commission be granted, be pleased to state, what the fees are and I will remit them with great pleasure. -- </p>
<p>Trusting you will excuse the very great liberty I have taken, as well as for the trouble imposed. -- </p>
<p>I have the high honor to remain 
<lb/>Very illustrious Sir,
<lb/>With distinguished consideration &amp; respect
<lb/>Your most obedient
<lb/>humble Servant.
