<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have just sent on a petition signed by all the officers of the 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi>, to Gov Bramlette, to have Lt Col Adams <hi rend="str">Adams</hi> Commissioned Col of the Regiment. please let me know by letter immediately if the Gov -- will Commission any one as Colonel, as we want to mak Capt Keene Major of the Regiment as soon as a vacancy occurs. if Adams is promoted there will then be two vacancies and Keene and Capt Rowland can both be made Majors. How is the enlistment of six months men getting along, what is Wolford doing. is there a chance for me to raise a Regiment in Ky. what have you and Fox done towards getting Law License for me. All the 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> Ky send their regards to you. </p>
<p>Ever your friend
<lb/>W. D. Carpenter.</p>
<p>The 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> Ky numbers over one Thousand men now and I think we should have the full no of officers allowed us. </p>
