<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>the Governor of Kentucky.
<lb/>Frankfort.
<lb/>Sir:</p>
<p>I subjoin a copy of a note of the <date when="1862-08-20">20<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> instant</date> addressed by that Department to the Honoralbe William Stuart, the Charg√© d'Affaires of Her Brit^t^anic Majesty, expressing an opinion as to the liability of aliens who have merely declared an intention to become citizens of the United States, to serve in the Militia.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be,
<lb/>Your obedient servant

<p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE,
<lb/><hi rend="italic">Washington</hi>, <date when="1862-08-20"><hi rend="italic">August</hi> 20, 1862.</date></p>
<p>SIR: Having informally understood from you that British subjects who had merely declared their intention to become citizens of the United States had expressed apprehensions that they might be drafted into the militia under the late requisition of the War Department, I have the honor to acquaint you, for their information, that none but citizens are liable to militia duty in this country, and that this Department has never regarded an alien who may have merely declared his intention to become a citizen as entitled to a passport, and consequently has always withheld from persons of that character any such certificate of citizenship</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, with high consideration, sir, your obedient servant. 
<lb/>WILLIAM H. SEWARD.</p>
<p>To Hon. WILLIAM STUART, &amp;c &amp;c.<pb/>
<lb/>Honble W. H. Seward</p>
