Edwards by four letters written by Cols Garrot &amp; Brown General Harlin and Capt H. I. Todd Major Mahony and several others the above letters was given me some months ago to visit Genl Fry. I done so. they were entirely satisfactory but there was nothing I felt competant to undertake at his hand as I dislike to botch business this I do to show your Excellency the grounds for my appointment by Col Edwards I complied strictly with the<pb/>
<lb/>the work Contained in the appointment to the <date when="--04-07">7 april</date> at which my time expired I was directed to report to Genl. Lindsey I done so I Hunted up some six soldiers one new saddle and a number of arms delivered them over to the quartermaster those arms have heretofore been drawn and not returned of which there are plenty yet out Some of the above soldiers have been absent from their regiments seven months and in this time I have sons in the federal service they would not be favorites nor screaned by me acting in a military capacity tis true we have a deputy marshal here he may do all that is proper to do -- even on that matter I say no more Your Excellency might ask how<pb/>
<lb/>He obtained his appointment it was obtained through his father-in-law Capt Martin of Lexington, who was intimate with the marshal of that place without a word against Capt Shuts I tell your Excellency there are deserters from both armies through our county and very often in our town</p>
