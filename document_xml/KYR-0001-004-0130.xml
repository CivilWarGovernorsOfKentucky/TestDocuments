<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>T. E. Bramlett
<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sir.</p>
<p>The negro woman Caroline now under sentence for poisoning the child of Mr Levy; was Examined in the city, ^court^ &amp; she was held over to answer, the Testimony showing probable cause to suspect her guilty. I was not present At the final Trial &amp; did not hear the Testimony given to the Jury. but from the Statement of the Rev. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Kee, of the Jailor &amp; Several others who heard the Trial &amp; have had an opportunity to convene with Caroline since she has been sentenced, I have become satisfied that there is to say the least great doubt of her Guilt; and that her case presents strong grounds for Executive Interference.</p>
<p>I am D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Sir
<lb/>Very respectfully
<lb/>Geo. W. Whaston.</p>
