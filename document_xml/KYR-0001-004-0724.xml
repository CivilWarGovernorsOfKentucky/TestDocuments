   <p>To his Excellency Governor Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>We the undersigned beg leave to state that at the <date when="--04">present April Term</date> of the Union Circuit Court in the case of the Commonwealth vs Joseph and Abram Sprague" for keeping a Tipling house, the Defts were fined $120. under the instructions of the court. No Extenuating or mitigating circumstances being allowed to be introduced as evidence-</p>
<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Joseph Sprague is an old man one of the most law abiding men in Union County Keeping Tavern in Caseyville Ky.</p>
<p>He made application at the regular term of the County Court for license to keep Tavern; but the County Judge being dead, and his successor, not having been Elected, the Clerk, entered his application, and told him to go on with his tavern, which said Spragues did thinking they had full authority. Mess Joseph Sprague and his son are undoubted loyal men, and in our opinion in this case, the clemency of <hi rend="str">your</hi> the executive in remitting said fine would be just &amp; proper &amp; merciful</p>
