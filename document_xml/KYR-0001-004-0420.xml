<lb/>His Excellency Thomas E Bramlette.
<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>I was called on this morning, by M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi>. Henry Mitchell, to recommend him, to executive clemency.</p>
<p>I can &amp; do cheerfully state for him, that I have known him long, &amp; have ever regarded him, as a sober discreet, well behaved man, he is poor, indeed insolvent, &amp; I suppose his securities, will be compelled to pay the fine, should the same be collected.</p>
<p>I can further state that I was present, at the trial, was not engaged in the case &amp; from my casual hearing of the evidence &amp; speeches made by lawyers, the impression was made on my mind that he would be acquitted, &amp; was somewhat surprised, at a different result.</p>
<p>This is all that I can say, am usually well satisfied with the action of our executive &amp; of course will be in this case, but am inclined to believe, that at least a part of the fine, should be remitted.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be respectfully &amp;<hi rend="sup">c</hi>.
