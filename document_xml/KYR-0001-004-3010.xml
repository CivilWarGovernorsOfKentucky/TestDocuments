   <p>To Thomas E Bramlete Governor of the State of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Espenard Brown would respectfully state That in the year <date when="1861">1861</date> sometime after night he was approached by a friend of his and told that his brother N B Brown had been beaten to death by a man David Lovelace. Your petitioner at once hastened to his brother who he found insensible and almost covered with his own blood That this at once exasperated your petitioner and he at once started to seek the man who had thus treated his brother who was known to be a quiet and unoffensive man and had gone but a short distance until he unfortunately met Lovelace. That in the excitement of the moment and without time for reflection and calm thought he ascerted Lovelace angry words were exchanged and he shot and killed Lovelace That he immediately set about to attone for his rash act and sold all the property he owned and gave the proceeds to the wife and childen of Lovelace. That the act was not done deliberately but while your petitioner was under the Influenc of outrage inflicted as he<pb/>
<lb/>thought upon his brother by a man who was greatly his superior in phisical power. That so far as he has been able he has made all the reperation that could be made to the relatives of the deceased. That petitioner is a young man whose family and friends are dear to him and with all becoming modesty would further state that he has always occupied a respectable position in the community where he lives. In <unclear/> of all these facts and appealing to the history of the transaction for at <unclear/> <unclear/> of the one act of his life he appeals to you for executive clemency and that he be pardoned for this offence for which he stands indicted in the M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cracken Circuit Court for Murder</p>
