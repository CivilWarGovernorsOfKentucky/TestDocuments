   <p>To his Excellency Governer Bramlette</p>
<p>your Petitioner James H Watkins says that he was <hi rend="underline">fined</hi> One hundred dollars on the trial of an Indictment agst him at the <date when="1864-08">August Term of the Laurel Circuit Court 1864.</date> -- He says that he was drinking and excited at the time and has no recollection of shooting at the prosecutor, and is Sorry for his conduct and will not do so again.</p>
<p>He says that he is a poor man, with a large family to support, and owing to the condition of the country in which he resides it is a hard matter for a poor man to live &amp; support his family. He says that he cannot possibly pay said fine with out great inconvenience and injury to himself and family, -- that the payment of the costs alone will be oppressive on him. -- He therefore prays your Excellency to remit said fine</p>

<p>I am acquainted with the Petitioner and believe the fine ought to be remitted and feel Confident the Community in which the parties reside would be gratified at its remission.</p>

<p>We were on the Jury and in consideration that J. H Watkins is a <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> man ^only in moderate circumstances^ with a family to support, and thinking it probable that the costs and charges will be as much as he can pay without oppression, we would be satisfied that the Governor should remit the fine afs<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and we join in asking the remittance</p>
