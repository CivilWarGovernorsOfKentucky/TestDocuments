   <p>Richmond Ky <date when="1862-04-14">April 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1862</date>
<lb/>Gov Magoffin</p>
<p>A petition was presented me a few days since for the pardon of B. T. Richardson and J. C. Arvine which I cheerfully signed. The offense with which they are charged is the shooting Solon Harris <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>but believing there were circumstances attending the case calling for Executive clemency I voluntarily address you this private appeal in behalf of these men. I know them well and are convinced a pardon at your hands would not only meet the approbation of the community but would be a mercy to them. They are both clever honest upright men belonging to as good families as any in this county. </p>
<p>They are poor and have been annoyed by Civil Suits and prosecutions since the fight with Harris (who is a rich man) until they are nearly ruined. </p>
<p>Arvine has a large family and his wife I understand is by no means a healthy woman but almost entirely dependent on her husband. They had some property but all is gone. Richardson has no children but his wife I know to be a most estimable young Lady. Believing this to be a case in which the exercise of the pardoning power would be of great service to the accused and their friends and that the Laws would not suffer in its exercise I have made the above statements to your Excellency. </p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Will Jennings </p>
