   <p>Lebanon Ky
<lb/><date when="1865-07-29">July 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1865</date>
<lb/>To his Excellency Gov Bramlette:
<lb/>Executive Mansion:
<lb/>Frankfort
<lb/>Ky.
<lb/>Gov.</p>
<p>Your petitioners would <hi rend="str">es</hi>respectfully represent to your Excellency that Joseph B Russell a citizen of this County has been indicted by the Marion Circuit Court as follows; For the offense of "<hi rend="underline">Shooting with</hi> i<hi rend="underline">ntent</hi> <hi rend="underline">to Kill</hi>," alledged to have been committed on the person of Maurice Doody on the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> day of August 1863; for the offense of <hi rend="underline">Robbery</hi>, of the property of Geo. W. Graves alledged to have been Committed on the <date when="1863-08-09">9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of August 1863</date>; for the offense of <hi rend="underline">Robbery</hi>, alledged to have been committed on the <date when="1863-08-09">9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of August 1863</date> the taking alledged to have been of the property of Joseph Boarman; for the offense of <hi rend="underline">malicious</hi> <hi rend="underline">mischief</hi> committed as alledged on the <date when="1863-11-01">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> day of November 1863</date> on the property of W. K Mitchell; in all of which stated causes said Russel has given his bond to answer said charges &amp; render himself amenable to the orders of court &amp;c, your petitioners would state that from what they know of the conduct of said Russel since the offenses stated were alledged to have been committed their belief<pb/>
<lb/>is that he is and will continue to be a good quiet and orderly citizen -- that if the offenses were committed as alledged, they were at a time when the country was convulsed with political &amp; military troubles, being just after Morgans extensive raid through Kentucky, and when the Country was overrun with guerilla's, and that in energy and activity against marauders and guerillas he may have in some instances overstepped the bounds of propriety &amp; law, but much should be allowed in his favor under all the Circumstances. He has been a zealous Union man. Your petitioners would ask -- that in view of the Circumstances you would grant him a pardon for the offenses charged. They think it would not be improper, or mitigate against the good order and harmony of this county.</p>
