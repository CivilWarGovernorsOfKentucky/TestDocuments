   <p>To the Hon'ble Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E. Bramlette.
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Ky.</p>
<p>Your petitioner John Guthridge, would respectfully represent, to Your honor, That at the <date when="--06">June Term</date> of the Kenton Circuit ^Court,^ held at Independence, Kenton County, Ky., a verdict was rendered against your petioner, inflicting a fine of ten Dollars, and twenty days imprisonment in the county Jail, for a Breach peace. The indictment charged that your petitioner was guilty of Boisterous language and fighting. He states that he permitted himself to be carried away under the influence of liquor and violated the law. But that he is well convinced in his own mind that he will not again, suffer himself to be led astray. That he is the Father of several children, that the fact that he will have to remain in the county Jail, is very humilitating. That he feels very Keenly, the effect it would produce, not only ^on^ himself -- but his children. Your Petitioner has discharged the fine of Ten Dollars, evidenced by the receipt<pb/>
<lb/>of the Sheriff, herewith enclosed He would respectfully ask your honor to release him from the impriosonment; <date when="1863-11-16">November 16th 1863</date>.</p>
<p>John Guthridge</p>
<p>We the undersigned, feeling well satisfied, that the majority of the law has been sustained in the above case write with the Petitioner in his prayer for your interposition in his behalf, and release him from the imprisonment</p>
