<p><hi rend="italic">To Colonels Commanding Regiments Kentucky Enrolled Militia</hi>:</p>
<p>Your attention is particularly called to General Order No. 3, issued from the Adjutant General's office. The Governor therein calls for ten thousand (10,000) of the militia of the State to serve for six months. This call is made that an end may be put to the pending war during this summer, and the fall finding us enjoying all the blessings of peace. You are earnestly requested to take this matter in hand at once and raise a battalion, of if not a battalion, at least a company, from your Regimental District, and report with them to the nearest point of rendezvous. The limited time allowed requires that we should commence work immediately, and work in earnest. Having been honored by the strongest recommendations from your county, and, through the trust thereby imposed in you, been commissioned by his Excellency the Governor to an important military command, we are entitled to call upon and demand your earnest efforts to raise the men required in this call. I hope to hear a good report from you in a few days. The number of men required <hi rend="italic">are to be raised</hi>, and if they are not forth coming by volunteers, a draft will be promptly resorted to, and counties which have been heretofore delinquent <hi rend="italic">will be compelled to respond</hi>. Let us, then, have every Kentuckian step forward and sustain the true renown and glory of the State.</p>
