   <p>The Petition of Herman Hollander respectfully shows, that he by a Judgement of the Bourbon Circuit Court (a statement of which accompanies this petition) rendered at its <date when="1863-10">October Term 1863</date>, he was fined Eighty Dollars and judgment for that sum was rendered against him together with costs by the Court. He states that the charge alledged upon which this fine was imposed &amp; judgement rendered was untrue. The allegation was that he traded with Slaves;- There was no truth in the allegation. He had made no trade on the subject. He was absent from home at the time and knew nothing of the Circumstances till his return home. During his absence, his clerk as he was informed on his return, received into the house, a package of wool, which has been stolen from D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Kenny by some slaves, not knowing that it had been stolen. A drayman brought it to the door &amp; then delivered it. His clerk took it into the house supposing that when this petitioner got back he would know what to do with it. when he got home he ascertained the facts of the case &amp; returned the wool to Doctor Kenny the proper owner. This petitioner made no defence at the Circuit Court and judgment was rendered against him for the eighty Dollars as stated &amp; Costs<pb/>
<lb/>and as the case is really one of peculiar hardship and injustice he most Respectfully petitions His Excellency the Governor of the State to remit as much of the fine as is possible. Sworn under my hand this <date when="1864-12-11">11 Dec<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 186<hi rend="str">3</hi>4</date>. This petitioner would also state that since the imposition of said fine by the Judgment of the Court as aforsd he has met with a great loss by fire. He kept a shoe store in Paris, and is one of those unfortunate persons who was burnt out by the late fire in that place, by which several persons &amp; families were rendered homeless.</p>
<p>H. Hollander</p>

We are satisfied with the truth of his statements in that petition and we join with him in requesting the Governor to remit the fine alluded to Given under our hands this <date when="1864-01-11">11 Jany 1864</date>.</p>
