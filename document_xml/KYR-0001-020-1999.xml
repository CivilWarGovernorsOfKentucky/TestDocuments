<lb/>Dear Mr. Harlan:</p>
<p>Five years have now elapsed since a challenge was sent by me to Mr. S. I. M. Major, and since that time I have neither sent, accepted nor borne a challenge The Constitution gives the Governor power to grant a free pardon in such cases, and upon its presentation the oath of office is to be altered to suit the circumstances. Without such a pardon I cannot even practice law in this state. Now, I do not care about running for any office, but I are desirous of obtaining a license to practice law, and would take very much to have Gov. Magoffin grant me a pardon in order that I may<pb/>
<lb/>be at liberty to do so. Such an act on his part would in no degree operate to the injury of the public or of any individual, but would simply place me on a level with others, so for as removing the disfranchisement is concerned.</p>
<p>I wish you would do me the favor to see him on the subject, and take whatever preliminary steps you may deem neccessary. Please write to me the result of your interview with him, if you have one. By attending to this you will place under many obligations</p>
<p>Your friend
<lb/>Thos. M Green</p>
