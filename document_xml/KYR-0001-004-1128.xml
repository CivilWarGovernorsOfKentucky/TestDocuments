   <p>To his excellency Thomas E Bramlette Gov of the commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your petitioner Thomas Gibson states that at the present term of the Laurel Circuit Court he was fined the sum of $75.00 for failing to set up the tavern rates in his tavern house he states that he did not know there was any law requiring him to do so he having just taken out a tavern license for the 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> time in his life he states that the statute under which he was fined is highly penal, and he is a poor man just beginning in the word and the statute requires that within one months after the rates are fixed by the county court the tavern keeper shall procure from the clerk the rates &amp;c without fixing any time when the rates shall be fixed by the county Court or providing for the tavern keeper to have any notice when they are fixed, In consideration of the premises your petitioner prays your excellency to remit said fine except the cost</p>
<p>Thomas Gibson petitioner</p>
<p>We believe the Statements in the foregoing Petition are true and join in the prayer thereof</p>

<p>Gov Bramlet
<lb/>Dear</p>
<p>Sir I have no Idea that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gibson had any knowledge that the law required him to keep up Tavern rates in his house and therefore incured the penalty I think the penalty a severe one I hope you will remit the fine</p>

<p>Tho Gibson is a good citizen this is a very extraordinary penalty the fine ought to be remitted.</p>
