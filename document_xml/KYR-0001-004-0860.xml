<lb/>Govenor Bramlett.</p>
<p>I am personally well acquainted with the most of the signers to the petition to you to have the judgments against W. F. Griffing remitted. They are mostly good Union men. I would not endorse the Unionism of some of them. But I will and do endorse Griffing. I tell you Govenor I have tried him since his return from rebeldom. I believe his return and professions are sincere. You may be assured that I would not ask at your hands Executive clemency for Griffing unless I could give you the assurance that it was right to do so. I can make Griffing useful to the Government and expect to have him in my camp here. Remit his fines Govenor and send the remittances to me. I have not one cent to make out of this application. Hand Griffing over to me and change all the wrong if any to my account. Do what I request you and you will subserve the Union cause I know it.</p>
<p>Truly yours
