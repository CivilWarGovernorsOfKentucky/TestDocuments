   <p>State of Kentucky
<lb/>Caldwell County
<lb/>Gov. Thos. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort
<lb/>Ky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Edna Baker would state that she has for many years been a widow residing in Trigg County Ky when her husband died.</p>
<p>That in <date when="1861">1861</date> when the Rebellion sprang up in this country she had but one son left who had not grown up to manhood and settled; This was Linn B. Baker then about 18 years old. When the Confederates were raising troops in Trigg county every appliance was and by designing men to induce him to join the army. She did all she could to oppose it but the youthful love of adventure and the natural martial feeling of the youth of the land, till then dormant, was too much for Maternal influence and her son was swept into the vortex of <unclear/>. When <unclear/> embarked into it, he became noted as an action scout or partisan ranger as they were called. At the <date when="1863-06">June Term 1863</date> of the Caldwell Circuit court two Indictments were found against on charges of Robbery for acts done while so engaged as he supposed under lawful authority.</p>
<p>These Indictments were endorsed by the court for Bail for in the sum of five hundred dollars and the other in the sum of Two hundred dollars; for which process issued.</p>
<p>About the latter part of <date when="--09">September</date> last, her son Linn was arrested by a part of the<pb/></p>
<p>48<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Regt Ky Infantry stationed at princeton carried to that place and placed in the Military prison for political and Military offenses.</p>
<p>Shortly after this she was informed that he had been turned over to the civil authorities to answer the Indictments referred to above, and was handed over to the Jailor and Lodged in Jail in princiton. She went there to see him He was her youngest born, a sacred charge left her by an honored and respectable husband. She knew if she Bailed him out he would if possible appear in discharge of her liability. The courts demanded if collected would would strip her and leave in destitution in her last days. She had an <unclear>assurance</unclear> through friends that the Military had pledged themselves to leave him in the hands of the <hi rend="str">Military</hi> civil authorities and under the state of care, she signed two Bail Bonds for five hundred dollars cash before the county Judge of Caldwell county (one by mistake for $300 too much) and induced Leander Baker one of her sons to become her co-security.</p>
<p>She says that as soon as the Bonds were executed, the Military Authorities at Princeton the 48<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Infty arrested said Linn B. Baker again and immediately sent him to Hopkinsville and from there he was shortly after sent to Camp Morton Indiana as a Military or political prisoner where he is yet <unclear/></p>
<p>She says further that at the late <date when="--11">November Term</date> of the Caldwell Circuit Court, the Indictments being called and said Linn of course not answering as he<pb/></p>
<p>was at Camp Morton, an order was taken declaring the said Bonds as forfeited and summons now been secured on her and and Leander Baker to appear and show cause why Judgments be not rendered against them for the sum of $500 in cash case.</p>
<p>She says, she is sure if not carried off said Linn would have appeared in answer to said Indictments and in discharge of said Bail. And she further says she would not have signed the Bonds nor would said Leander, but for the opinion secured from Lieu<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi>. Col Hester 48<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Insfty. That the Military would leave him in the hands of the civil authorities when he had before placed him. But it seems that it was only a trick to get her into a Bond that would ruin her <hi rend="str">and</hi> to pay and then make her liable by carrying her son off so that he could not comply with its conditions.</p>
<p>She does not justify or <unclear/> the conduct her poor misguided and ruined son, but he is still her son and all the suffering that can be inflicted on her cannot <unclear/> that part from her heart. She hopes, she has violated no law and has done nothing but her duty: But she must say, it would be exceedingly unjust for her to be stripped and reduced to want in her old age by such unjustifiable means as have been and in this case; She therefore prays your Excellency to remit the forfeit <unclear/> <unclear/> each of said Bonds and where her and her son Leanders therefrom<pb/></p>
<p>and as is duty bound will ever pray &amp;c</p>
<p>Edna Baker</p>
<p>copies of the bonds and ordered of forfeiture are herewith sent for inspection.</p>
<p>I would ask the Governor to remit the forfeiture set forth in the above petion of my mother. The facts are all as stated by her. I am very poor and the forfeiture was not only against the wishes of all concerned, but compliance was rendered impossible by those who promised that they would not do so
