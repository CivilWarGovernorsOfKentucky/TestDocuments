<p>Jas F Hall</p>
<p>I was acting on Judgt when Jas F Hall came into court &amp; plead guilty, &amp; I rendered Judgment against him, He did it in the simple manner he has related. He made no statement except that he desired to get along with the matter in the shortest &amp; least expensive manner, I have no doubt that all he says in his petition is true, I am told by those who <hi rend="underline">know</hi> what they say to be true, that<pb/>
<lb/>Mr Hall is a young man of fine character, &amp; well deserving of Executive clemency, I trust the fine will be remitted,</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">G W Moore</hi></p>
<p>I have been acting as Atty for Com at the <date when="1864-09">Sep Term 1864</date> of Kenton circuit court, I concur with foregoing request that the fine of J F Hall be remitted,</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">J. G. Carlisle</hi></p>
<p>We know J F Hall well &amp; know him to be an exemplary young man, &amp; proving himself a worthy son of a widowed mother by employing his time diligently for her &amp; the support of her family, He is worthy of all credence, &amp; we unite in his request that the fine be remited,</p>
<p>Gov Bramlette</p>
