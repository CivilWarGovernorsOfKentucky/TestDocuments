<lb/>His Excellency,
<lb/>Thomas E Bramlett,
<lb/>Gov of Ky</p>
<p>Sir: -- I came in under the "Amnesty Proclamation," and took the Oath of allegiance in Col. G. W. Gallup's office, Commanding Dist East Ky, with the view to assist in maintaining Kentucky in her present loyal condition; subsequently I have gone into the Union Army.</p>
<p>Col Gallup told me that he would reccommend me to your consideration for the privelege if raiseing a Cavalry Company of Scouts to operate against Guerrillas invasions of our Noble old state. I am a Kentuckian by birth and education, and after having tried the merits of the Rebel Government, And know it to be a failure, I feell it my duty to do something now for my state. My service in the south was with raiding<pb/>
<lb/>parties, and I know how to meet them. I could no longer countenance their infringements, and resolved to quit them, and do something for the protection of my state.</p>
<p>If Col Gallup has done any thing for me, you will please let me know by return mail the result; and if you have not heard from him let me know the prospect for raising said Company. Please answer immediately, as I will not remain here but a short time.</p>
<p>I am Governor
<lb/>Respectfully your obdt sert,
<lb/>H H Parker.</p>
