<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>Beriah Magoffin Esqr
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Whereas at the last term of our Caldwell Circuit Court, in <hi rend="str">November</hi> <date when="1861-06">June last</date> the grand Jury of my county, found an indictment against myself for a little breach of the peace, in the way of playing a game of cards for amusement and past time the object of which was not to loose or gain any thing except drink a little accasionally which we did you understand it. I know, there was others concerned of which no indictment was found against them," I acknowledge that I was in the game of which I neither won nor lost anything I went before the Court as soon as the indictment was brought before the court, and confessed judgment of a fine of $10. as per a late act, in relation to gaming in any way, I thought it useless to have the case on Docket hoping therefore you will release the fine of $10. except attys cost &amp; com<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> which I have already paid and in so doing you will much oblige these hard times, and I'll do so no more.</p>
<p>Yours &amp;<hi rend="sup">c</hi>= W. E. Mitchisson
<lb/>(a<hi rend="underline">ns</hi>w<hi rend="underline">er</hi> s<hi rend="underline">oo</hi>n)</p>
<p>I, believe the statements above to be correct.</p>
