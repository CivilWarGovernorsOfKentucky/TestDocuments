The case was regularly called and judgment rendered at the <date when="1860-10">October term of said court 1860</date>. All of said judgement, save that due the Commonwealth, has been paid. Said Indictment was made under the following circumstances. Your petitioner was, at the time, on a visit to Versailles and accidentally stepped into a room where the game of Faro was being played. He then found several acquaintances, among others &amp; the gentleman dealing. At the urgent solicitation of the gentleman dealing, your petitioner consented to deal one or two hands. While so dealing a certain gentleman of Versailles lost money on the game. Becoming experated<pb/>
<lb/>at his loss, he paid another by stander five dollars to have your petitioner <hi rend="underline">indicted</hi>. Your petitioner was simply dealing as a passtime and as an accomodation to the crowd without having the interest of our solatary inst in the Bank, its winnings or loosings.</p>
<p>If at all agreeable to your Excellencys will, your pe^ti^tioner would be more than thankful for a remission of that portion of the fine due the Commonwealth of Ky -- </p>
