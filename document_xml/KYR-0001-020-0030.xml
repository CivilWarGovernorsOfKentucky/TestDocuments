   <p>To
<lb/>His Excellency, Beriah Magoffin Governor, of the Commonwealth of Kentucky -- Dear Sir -- </p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Caldwell County Ky. have long Known Thomas. B. Wadlington and he has ever been considered a good &amp; true hearted citizen, Known &amp; noted for his industry &amp; orderly &amp; peaceable conduct -- The difficulty in which he was engaged with M. A. Cartwright did not appear to us to be of his seeking, nor are we satisfied, nor do we believe that the case was fairly presented to the Jury, as it actually occurred -- We hope your Excellency will review the case, and give the poor man the benefit of every doubt &amp; we desire that his case may be judged of in mercy &amp; regarded with favor, and that Your Excellency will take into consideration every circumstance that ought to operate in his favor &amp; behalf -- And we desire that your Excellency may &amp; will be persuaded that it is consistent with your duty to extend to him Executive Clemency &amp; that his life may be spared, either by a full pardon or a commutation of his punishment --  -- Yours respectfully
