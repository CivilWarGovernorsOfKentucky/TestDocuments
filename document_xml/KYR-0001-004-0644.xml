<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Gov Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort Ky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>At the <date when="--12">December Term</date> of the Kenton Circuit Court two inditments against George Oakes were tried and and he found guilty and fined by a jury in one case $60 and the other $200 One of the indictments was for keeping a tippling house and the other was for suffering gaming. The proof in the first case was that defd had a little Shanty and was cutting wood and selling it &amp;c<pb/></p>
<p>and that he had sold whiskey twice and suffered it to be drunk on the premises In the second case the proof was that a party of men had played poker in the Cabin in the woods of Oakes five cents ante. The Defendant is a very poor &amp; ^ignorant^ man and unable to pay this fine. indeed he cannot pay. If he pays the costs it will be as much as I think he can do I have written this at the request Messrs Hamilton &amp; Carlisle who have taken some interest in this man. On a/c of the extreme poverty of the defendant I think this a proper case for execution interposition<pb/>
<lb/>and mercy</p>
<p>Very truly your
<lb/>obt servt
