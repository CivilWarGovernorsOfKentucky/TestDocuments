<lb/>Hon Beriah Magoffin Govr of Ky 
<lb/>Dr.. Sir</p>
<p>The Petition of James Wright for the remission of a fine of $45 will be sent you -- I was on the defense for Mr. Wright -- Some evidence was given to the effect that Wright before he was shot at by Neville <hi rend="str">to the effect that he</hi> threw up his left hand as if to push Neville back which fact was relied on by Nevilles Counsel as showing that Wright had made the first assault -- we did not know that we could ^prove^ by Maxwell that this throwing of Wrights hand up was but an effort on the part of Wright to keep Neville off, till the trial was over when of cause it was too late to be of service -- without this matter of throwing the hand up Wright had <hi rend="str">a</hi> showed as clear a right of self defence as ever was shown in the Courthouse having been shot at by Neville with a Navy Revolver<pb/>
<lb/>at a distance of not over two steps the shot passing over Maxwells shoulder &amp; by his <unclear/> &amp; <unclear/> Wright but stunning him for a few moments by the concussion &amp; <unclear/> of powder in his face &amp; eyes -- </p>
<p>Mr Wright is a steady man, a mechanic cannot get much work these times -- He has a wife &amp; children and is poor &amp; has to rent property to live in -- To pay the fine will oppress him verry much -- I think his case is one that merits your interposition &amp; if given will meet the hearty approval of our community -- </p>
<p>I hope you will find it consistent with the proper discharge of your duties to give him the reliff he prays for</p>
<p>With verry great respect 
<lb/>I am &amp;c
<lb/>John Shuck </p>
