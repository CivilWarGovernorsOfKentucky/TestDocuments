  <body>
   <p>To his Excellency Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Bramlette.</p>
<p>Your petitioner Charles B Hill a citizen of Maysville respectfully represents to your Excellency that at the present term of the Mason Circuit Court he was find $400 for shooting at and wounding in a sudden affray and in sudden heat and passion one Edward M. Best -- He shot at M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Best who is a very strong athletic man under circumstances which he at the time felt and still feels should excuse him, but which he could not from the suddenness of the unexpected occurrence, completely get before the jury. M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Best when sober is well enough behaved; but when intoxicated is very turbulent <hi rend="str">and</hi> quarrelsome and dangerous In fact when intoxicated he is a madman and seems unconcious of his acts whilst in that state -- He has already taken the life of one man under circumstances of the sort &amp; of which your petitioner believes he was unconscious<pb/>
<lb/>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Best at petitioners own door when drunk raised a controversy with petitioner which he persisted in, and finally raised a chair to strike petitioner, who gave way -- but was pursued &amp; whilst Best had the chair raised petitioner shot him through the arm a short distance <hi rend="str">above</hi>below the elbow. Petitioner believed he was in danger from Bests attack and shot under these circumstances. Petitioner did not shoot to Kill him as he could have done, being only from 4 to 5 feet apart, but thought he would disable him by shooting him through the arm -- All these facts are true, but he could not disclose them fully to the jury -- </p>
<p>He and Best had always been friends -- He regrets that any such occurrence should have taken place is rejoiced <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>for the sake of Bests family &amp; his own, that it was no worse. M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Best has recovered or nearly so, and will suffer but little inconvenience from the wound as he believes.<pb/></p>
<p>He supposes in the eye of the law he is to blame to some extent -- Placed under the circumstances that surrounded him at the time he did not feel that he was doing wrong -- </p>
<p>The fine he thinks is excessive -- and hopes your Excellency will remit all of it except that part which constitution indicates to the atto for Commwlth and costs The <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>payment of that is ample punishment under the real circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Chas B Hill</p>
<p>I think under the facts developed in the case of M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Hill, alluded to in the foregoing petition, that the fine is excessive. He was unable on the trial to put the case fully before the jury as he felt and understood them at the time, and upon which acted. Could he have done so I think the result would have been different.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">H. Taylor</hi><pb/></p>
<p>I fully concur with general Taylor and recommend your Excellency to remit so much of the fine as the Law allows</p>
<p>L W Andrews
<lb/>Judge</p>
<p>I think it is a case that demands the interposition of<hi rend="str">th</hi> Executive power -- </p>
