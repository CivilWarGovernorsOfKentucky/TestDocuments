   <p>To His Excellency Gov. Robinson:</p>
<p>The undersigned would respectfully represent that on the <date when="1862-05-20">20 day of May, 1862</date> a summons from the Kenton Circuit Court was executed on her, which required Josephine Starke to appear in said Court at the <date when="1862-06">June term, 1862</date>, and answer an indictment for selling liquor without licence -- The undersigned<hi rend="sup">s</hi> name is Josephine Stohr, and she supposed that the officer had by mistake served the process on the wrong person, and she was advised by an attorney (J. M. Kennedy Esq, who is now in the military service of the United States) that she need not give the matter any attention -- She accordingly employed no counsel and was not present at the trial -- The name was corrected on the record as she is advised, and she was fined $50<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi>, but she never knew any thing of it until the court had adjourned its term, nor until an execution was issued against her. She said she does not know what testimony was produced against her, but she is certain that she never was guilty of the charge made in the indictment.<pb/>
<lb/>She is a German and speaks and understands the English language very imperfectly -- She is a widow and makes her living by washing and ironing and performing such other work as she can procure, and it is impossible for her to pay said fine and costs out of her own earnings -- She might, perhaps, pay it a little at a time out of the money sent her by her son, who is a private in the military service of the United States= It will press her sorely to pay the costs and the fee of the attorney for the Commonwealth -- She has already paid to the sheriff a part of the costs.</p>
<p>Wherefore she asks your Excellency to remit such part of said fine as the law authorizes &amp;c</p>
<p>Ms Josephine Stohr</p>
<p>We would respectfully recommend the case of Mrs Stohr as a proper one for the exercise of executive clemency.</p>
