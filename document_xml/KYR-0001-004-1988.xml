Mess Baird &amp; Price in their surprise at so large a Bail because sureties, when the indemnity given to them was its shape very inadequate. I believe from all the circumstances with which I had occasion to become acquainted that Mess B. &amp; P. if they have to pay the judgment would lose $2835 <hi rend="sup">00</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi>. I earnestly recommend them to your Excellency's clemency to that extent</p>
