<lb/>His Excellency.
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir.</p>
<p>This letter will be handed you by Miss Mitchell a young lady of high standing in this city. She comes to lay before your Excellency a petition in behalf of her Brother Edward Mitchell who was recently convicted of manslaughter in our Circuit Court.</p>
<p>I would say to you that Edward Mitchell was a private in the Louisville Legion, <hi rend="underline">and</hi> <hi rend="underline">fought</hi> <hi rend="underline">like</hi> <hi rend="underline">a hero</hi> and was remarkable for his quiet and orderly deportment. For three years I knew him well, and can cheerfully testify to his worth as a soldier. He did his duty in every battle in which the proud old Legion participated, He is a kind hearted boy, and bitterly regrets what he has done. I am persuaded he will never again suffer himself to be ensnared by that common enemy <hi rend="underline">strong</hi> <hi rend="underline">drink</hi>, I believe he will yet make a good citizen, and if you can see you way clear to interpose executive clemency it will gladden the hearts of his distressed relatives, and put a brave and heroic youth in a position to redeem the past I most respectfully ask a pardon for him.</p>
<p>Yours truly J H, Bristow
<lb/>Late Chaplain Louisville Legion</p>
