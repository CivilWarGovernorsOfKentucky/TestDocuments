   <p>To the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:</p>
<p>The undersigned states that subsequent to the Presidential election of <date when="1856">'56</date> he was by the Grand Jury of Franklin County indicted for betting on the election and at the <gap/> Term <date when="1857">1857</date> of the Franklin Circuit Court fined one hundred dollars and the costs of suit -- upon which capias has issued and is now in the hands of the Sheriff of said county who is urging and will enforce its payment.</p>
<p>The alleged charge of betting grew of the sale of a horse, the price of which depended upon the result of the election, and in no other way -- it was not done with a view of influencing any man's vote, but mainly through the influence of others -- nor was it done in the way of making money by chance. The undersigned has never been in the habit of betting on elections or on anything else -- and this sale was the result of accidental circumstances and by way of simple banter, and not from <hi rend="str">what is generally considered</hi> a desire of gain or to influence votes -- Since <date when="1857">1857</date> the undersigned has been a citizen of Missouri, and now is a citizen of that state -- He is here temporarily for the sake of his<pb/>
<lb/>health which is not good -- He wishes to return to his home as soon as he is able to bear the fatigue of travelling. If compelled to pay said fine he will not have money enough left to bear his expenses home. This is the first ^&amp; only^ time he was <hi rend="str">seen</hi> ever indicted for an alleged violation of law, and having always aimed to obey every law, and designing no wrong in the sale out of which grew the charge of betting, he respectfully asks for a remission of the <hi rend="str">fine</hi> judgment, except fees and costs -- </p>

<lb/>Kentucky, Franklin Co</p>
<p>R. G. Johnson states that he is well acquainted with John W Blair and has known him for many years -- he has a personnal <hi rend="str">circumstance</hi> knowledge of the circumstances out of which grew the indictment and knows the facts to be as stated in the petition. Said Blair is a good citizen, obedient to the law and has never before, or since to affiants knowledge or belief, been charged with a violation of law -- Affiant is Blairs stepson inlaw, and can state that<pb/>
<lb/>Blair is not a betting man, and the sale of the horse is the only thing of the kind ever brought against him. Blair never tried to influence the votes of others, was slow and quiet in politics, and affiant does not think that he ever knowingly did anything with a view to corrupt or influence the elections. Said Blair is in bad health, and too sick to come to town to make personal application in this case -- </p>
