   <p>To His Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully represent that Capt John W. Bush of 48<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Regiment Kentucky Volunteers now Commanding military post at Smithland Kentucky stands charged in the Lyon Circuit Court with the Killing of one Richard Harris a citizen of said County. The circumstances attending the act as Known to some of your petitioners and as developed on the Examining trial are these. In the summer of <date when="1863">1863.</date> the said Bush was engaged in canvassing the County of Lyon for Recruits for the 48<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Regiment and among others he recruited young Harris son of said Richard. Whereat said Richard became exasperated at Bush (notwithstanding they had always been intimate friends) and demanded the release of his son threatening Bush with personal violence in case of his refusal. Bush disclaimed the power to release Harris the Recruit. but agreed to refer the matter to the Colonel of the Regiment whereupon Harris in a great rage struck Bush and followed him up Bush retreating some fifteen feet remonstrating with Harris not to follow. but Harris still advancing Bush fired and Harris fell mortally wounded. After which Bush surrendered first to the Military and afterwards to the Civil Authority: refusing to escape though having every facility to do so for three weeks after the Killing</p>
<p>Upon the examining trial before two Justices one loyal the other disloyal prosecuted by a notorious rebel formerly a recruiting officer for the Rebel army Guarded by discharged soldiers tried upon the testimony of men the greater number of whom were his political enemies and with all the prejudice and hatred of a Community steeped in treason and Rebellion towards one who fearless of consequences had denounced the Rebellion and its abettors publicly and privately throughout<pb/>
<lb/>the County of Lyon. the very nest and hot bed of treason. yet with all these adverse influences to combat. He was held to answer the charge of Kiling in <hi rend="underline">sudden heat and passion</hi> for which offense the Grand Jury found a Bill a copy of which will be transmitted herewith if obtained in time and he was admitted to bail to appear before the Lyon Circuit Court at its next December Term to answer said Indictment</p>
<p>Now it may please your Excellency Capt Bush is well known to us to be a high toned honorable man an efficient useful and zealous officer. his term of service expires in <date when="--10">October</date> next. He scorns to forfeit his bond and if not released by your Excellency will make his appearance before said Court if not slain by Guerillas while on his way. with scarce a hope fo obtaining Justice so great is the odium with which a federal soldier is regarded in Lyon County.</p>
<p>Captain Bush deeply laments the misfortune of having been forced by anothers folly to strike his friend to death. and we believe he will continue an exemplary citizen and soldier. Wherefore we most earnestly and confidently pray an interposition of Executive clemency in his behalf. that your Excellency award him an acquittal and turn the charge over to a Military tribunal to be investigated by a Court Martial as he desires or that you extend to him a full pardon of the offense thereby securing to his wife and four helpless children the protection and support of a husband and father and to his Country in this her time of need an arm that has been stretched forth in her defense from the Commencement of this wicked Rebellion until now.</p>
