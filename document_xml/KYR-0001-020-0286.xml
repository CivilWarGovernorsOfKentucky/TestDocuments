<lb/>To His Excellency, B. Magoffin, Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your Petitioners would most respectfully represent. That during the past summer One <hi rend="underline">James Collins</hi> of this (Adair) County, was prosecuted for Larceny -- charged with Stealing $5 -- or $6. from a <hi rend="str">country</hi> Store in this county, He was tried before an Examining Court &amp; Sent on to further trial in the Circuit Court, and gave Bail in the Sum of $250 -- with his father Thomas Collins Security, for his appearance at the Nov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Term of the Adair Circuit Court.</p>
<p>And at the first of Said Court the accused attended bet before the cause was called for trial he had left, <hi rend="str">having</hi> <hi rend="str">as</hi> <hi rend="str">his</hi> and upon the calling of the cause, he failed to appear &amp; Surrender himself into the hands of the proper officers for trial &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi> in consequence of which Said bond was <hi rend="underline">forfeited</hi>. And unless arrested by Your Excellencys Clemency, Said father (the Said Security) will be compelled to pay the Said bond.</p>
<p>Your Petitioners state that the accused is <hi rend="underline">a</hi> <hi rend="underline">poor &amp; ignorant young man</hi> -- and that the evidence against him is wholly circumstantial, and that his Said father the Surity in Said bond, is a poor &amp; industrious and <hi rend="underline">good</hi> citizen, with a large family of children to See to &amp; support. And if he is compelled to pay the amt. of Said bond it will bring ruin &amp; misery on him &amp; his<pb/>
<lb/>family -- Your petitioners now after making these plain Statements of the facts without exagerration, and being acquainted with the parties &amp; circumstances Surrounding the case, would most respectfully ask your Excellency to interpose, in behalf of <hi rend="underline">Said</hi> <hi rend="underline">father</hi> (Thomas Collins) if not of the erring Son, and through your clemency remit the penalty of Said bond, at least So far as to release the Security from it. Your petitioners feel assured that by so doing Your Excellency would do much to make Comfortable, &amp; cheerful the family of a poor but highly respectable man,</p>
