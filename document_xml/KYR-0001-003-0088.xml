<lb/>Sir.</p>
<p>As you will perceive I have been deputed by the people of Union Co Kentucky to confer with your Excellency on matters set forth in the accompanying remonstrance.</p>
<p>I hold the original with signatues attached, believing that you might possibly direct its transmission to the War Depart. or to the Gen. Comm<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">dg</hi></hi> the Department. The margin of the original is left open to be filled as you may deem best.</p>
<p>I also hold the affidavits of returned Southern officers, which sets forth the fact that Union Co has sent 510 recruits to the Southern Army -- independent of those who have acted with roving Guerrilla bands</p>
<p>The Provost Marshall of the Co. Capt Firrin says the Co is credited with 200 who have enlisted in the Fed. Army. 180 blacks have been forcibly conscripted. And yet the present call on that Co is for 452 more! The sum total (nearly 900) is preposterously large. The entire voting population, since a portion has been cut off to form Webster Co. has never reached 1200. There is a mistake somewhere. The quotas of Crittenden and Hopkins under the last call are less than 50 each, as I am informed. It is apparent that a mistake exists prejudicial to Union Co. We respectfully ask you to enquire into &amp; rectify it.</p>
<p>Let me entreat you by every consideration of justice and humanity, to intervene with your whole power as Chief Magistrate, in the case of the orphan girls named in the accompanying affidavit of B, P, Cissel. The Hon Ben. has always been a rebel in feeling, but his solemn affirmation is about impeachment If you desire to honor me with any<pb/>
<lb/>communication, I will receive it if directed to Louisville this week or to Morganfield afterwards. If you desire a personal interview, I will take great pleasure in waiting on your Excellency either at Frankfort or elsewhere</p>
<p>I know you are overburdened with care at this particular juncture. We will regard your attention to our grievances amid your other cares as a special favor</p>
<p>With sentiments of profound respect
<lb/>I have the honor to be Your Obt. Servant
<lb/>Matthew Howard</p>
