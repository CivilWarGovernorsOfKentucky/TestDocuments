<p>Your petitioner Mary W. Smith, would respectfully represent, that she confessed a judgment for Sixty Dollars, upon an Indictment for keeping a tippling House, at the present term of the Warren Equity &amp; Criminal Court. The facts of the case are these. She proposed to open a Hotel in the town of Bowling Green and being a widow woman employed a young man by name of J. R. Newton to attend to <hi rend="str">Her</hi> the business of said House and as such to procure the necessary License for same. He obtained the municipal License for $150.00 and the United States License for $45.00 and thinking the License for keeping Said House complete, he failed to obtain the State License from the county Court ^$10^ and never knew but what her License was complete, until She was indicted. She says She never intentionally violated the law and requests a remission of said fine at your hands -- </p>
