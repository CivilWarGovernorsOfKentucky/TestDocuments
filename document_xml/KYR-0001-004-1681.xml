<p>There was a Judgment rendered at the same term of the court vs our ould friend John A. Bowman for sixty Dollars ^for Tipling^ that I think ought to be remitted as I have no Idea he intended to violate the law, my opinion is that he <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> only had a small quantity of Brandy on hand for his own use and some of his friends in passing by called on him for some and he was to kind hearted to refuse them and brandy was so high he did not think he could afford to give it to them.</p>
