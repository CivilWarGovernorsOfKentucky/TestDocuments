   <p>To His Excellency Gov. Magoffin:</p>
<p>The undersigned would respectfully represent that O. B. Wiggins was fined the sum of $50<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> at the present term of the Kenton Circuit Court upon a plea of guilty to a charge of illegal voting -- Mr Wiggins has lived for more than two years in the same ward and in the same magisterial district, but just previous to the last August election he removed to a house a few squares distant from his former residence, and when the election came on he voted as usual -- He afterwards ascertained that he had moved across a line which had been established by the city council dividing the district into two voting precincts. This line was established by an ordinance passed in the year <date when="1851">1851</date>, and <hi rend="str">has</hi> which has never been published among the ordinances of the city, but was to be formed only among the records in the city Clerks office -- Mr Wiggins was wholly ignorant of the location of the line, and when he ascertained his mistake, he plead guilty to the charge and was fined as above stated -- We have known Mr. Wiggins for a long time, and can bear testimony to his honesty and correct deportment in all the relations of life -- He could not have been induced to vote illegally had he known it; and we respectfully ask your Excellency to remit said fine to the extent of your power, and we will ever pray &amp;c<pb/></p>
