   <p>Head-Qrs. Mil. Div. of the Mississippi
<lb/>Chattanooga Tenn: <date when="1863-12-14">Dec. 14" 1863</date>
<lb/>Maj. W. H. Sidell
<lb/>A. A. Pro. Marshal Gen of Ky.
<lb/>Major</p>
<p>Your letter of the <date when="1863-12-09">9<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> inst</date> endosing copy of Governor Bramlette of the <date when="1863-12-08">8<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi></date> relative to Maj Gen. Hurlbut's late order affecting conscription in that part of his District embraced in the State of Kentucky, is just received. Maj. Gen. Herman commands the Dept. embracing Gen. Hurlbut's command and the matter should be referred to him, or at least through him,but the General being now in East Tennessee, and rather inaccesible I will correct any abuse that may have already occurred and give proper direction for future action.</p>
<p>The State of Kentucky having civil laws, and officers to enforce them, should not be interfered with any more than any other loyal State, except when it may become necessary to maintain peace and order at a Military Post. The towns of Paducah, Columbus and Hickman have no doubt become places of refuge for disreputable persons from all parts of the Country. Gen. Hurlbut's order was intended, or ought to intend, to correct the evil. Further than to collect these people I will direct him to desist from the execution of his order in the state of Ky. Actual citizens of the towns named, who have committed no act against Military law, shall not be molested by the order.<pb/></p>
<p>I am Major, Very respectfully
<lb/>Your obt. svt.
<lb/>(signed) U. S. Grant.
<lb/>Maj. Genl.</p>
