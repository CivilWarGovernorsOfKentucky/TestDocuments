  <body>
   <p>To his excellency Thomas E Bramlett Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Samuel Denham Respectfully shoeth unto your excellency that at the <date when="1865-08">August term of the Whitley Circuit Court 1865</date> he was fined Seventy five Dollars and convicted to ten days imprisonment in the jail of Whitley County for a breech of the peace committed by fighting with C. L. Creekmore in the town of Williamsburg he states that the dificulty came up suddenly and unexpectedly over some fuss &amp; dificulties between the children Mr Creekmore and petitioner that in said fight no weapons were used of any discription, your petitioner states that he had been taken up by D. H. Luforce a Justice of the peace for Whitley County &amp; fined by a Jury for the same offence but the Magistrate before whom he was tried failed to render a Judgement upon the verdict of the jury and although your petitioner paid the fine &amp; cost and the fine was paid into the public treasury he could<pb/>
<lb/>not plead said proceeding in bar because the Justice D. H. Laforce had failed to render a Judgement upon the verdict of the Jury-</p>
<p>You petitioner is a sober man of steady habits and has a family of children and an afflicted wife and he prays your Excellency to interpose your pardoning power and remit said fine ^imprisonment^ and is in duty and will ever pray</p>
<p>Samuel Denham
<lb/>Petitioner</p>
<p>I hope your excellency may grant the prayer of the petitioner

<lb/>I am well acquainted with Samuel Denham the petitioner and know him to be a good Citizen and altho' I was not engaged in the case. I have no hesitation in saying that in my judgment it would be right to ^grant the^ remitt <hi rend="str">the Judgmt</hi> referred, the people here will endorse it &amp; I hope you will grant the relief</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/><hi rend="underline">W. H. Randall</hi></p>
<p>I concur with W H Randall</p>
<p>Granville Pearl</p>
<p>Gov Bramlette I think it will be right to remit the fine &amp; imprisonment &amp; hope you will do it</p>

<p>I know Mr Denham personally, well, he is a highly respectable Gentleman, perphaps the only case of difficulty of this in which he has ever been engaged, and believe that it would be right to remit the penalty</p>
