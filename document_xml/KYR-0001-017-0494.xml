<lb/>Dr Sir</p>
<p>I am informed that a copy of the order of the Wayne County Court appointing G. C Ingram Coroner of this County to fill the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of the old Coroner was forwarded some time ago and Commission was requested but none has benn forwarded It is exceedingly important that he be commissioned, as we have neither sheriff or Coroner at this time. </p>
<p>Under Law of elections article XI Revised Statutes Coroners who are elected by the voters of a county are not required to be commissioned, but where an appointment is made to fill a vacancy he is required to be Commissioned, see Rev. Statutes Chapter Sheriffs Jailors &amp; Coroners, <hi rend="str">secti</hi> article 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> section<pb/>
<lb/>11, There has been no change of the law in this respect so far as I have been able to ascertain. Whether there was any need of of making the destinction between those elected and appointed it is useless to inquire, the law as it stands being the only rule</p>
<p>Mr Ingram is competent and faithful I trust you will forward his Commission at once, The Govenor promised C H Buster at Harrodsburg to attend to the matter some time since, I enclose order of appointment</p>
<p>Truly &amp;c
