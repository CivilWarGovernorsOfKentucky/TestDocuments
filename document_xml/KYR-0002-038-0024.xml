<lb/><date when="1864-08-22">Aug. 22<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> 1864</date>.
<lb/>Your Excellency -- </p>
<p>Will, perhaps, remember having received a letter from O. L. Baldwin, Col. 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky. Cavalry, last winter, when he was on Recruiting service in this City, requesting you to appoint the undersigned Capt. in his Regt.?</p>
<p>You did not regard his request, and I went to the "front." -- joined my Command, the 2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> Ky. Battery, and was wounded last April, in a skirmish, in the left arm. My arm was <hi rend="str">m</hi> amputated. and I was transferred to this City.</p>
<p>Considering my military days over, I made application for discharge, on or about the <date when="--06-14">14<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of June</date>. My "Discharge for Disability" papers were "made out and forwarded for approval, but I have not heard from them since. I learn that they have been lost, between here and Knoxville, and I give them up in despair. Disiring my dis-<pb/>
<lb/>charge, I made application for Commission in Colored Troops. in order to get out of the service as a Com. Officer, by resignation. Yet I do not approve the arming of negroes.</p>
<p>Now, Sir, I request a favor of you as the friend of Col. Baldwin, with whom I served in the old Regulars; the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> U. S. Infantry.</p>
<p>I request you to Commission me in some Ky. Regt. to enable me to resign -- to get out of service. Will you do so?</p>
<p>Having the gift of oratory, I desire to stump the States of Ill. and Ind. for the Candidate of the Chicago Convention. But I cannot do so, as I am now situated. You can enable me to do so. Will you?</p>
<p>You can see what influence a Private soldier can have on the Stump who has <hi rend="str">lol</hi> lost a limb in the service. </p>
<p>Then give me the opportunity? If you do not I shall have to obtain my discharge, or release from Military service by resorting to the method I have mentioned above.</p>
<p>I would come to the Capital and<pb/>
<lb/>make my application in person, if I had the means and the liberty to do so, which I have not.</p>
<p>Col. Baldwin is candidate for Senator from this District, and I might do him some service, if I had the opportunity, <hi rend="str">as</hi> But as it is my hands are tied.</p>
<p>By granting my request you will enable me to attend personally to the wants of aged Parents and brothers and Sisters.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be
<lb/>Your Excellencies Most
<lb/>Obedient Servent

<lb/>To Governor:</p>
<p>Stating that Col. Baldwin, 5<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky. Cav. wrote last winter recommending him as Capt. in his Regt. Not receiving answer, he went to "Front" and was wounded in left arm <date when="--04">last April</date>. It was amputated and he was sent to Lou. He applied for discharge. Papers were made out and forw<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> for approval. They were lost between here and Knoxville. He now wishes an appt_ in some Ky. reg't. so that he can resign. Wishes to stump states of Ill. and Ind. for nominee of Chicago Convention.</p>

<p>Adjt Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi></p>
<p>I have no recollection of such recommendation or refusal -- because it has been our fixed rule to commission those recommended by the County officer. -- If there is a place which can be given him to enable him to get out of the service as desired -- let it be done.</p>
