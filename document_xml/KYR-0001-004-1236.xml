<lb/>by an express prohibition on his part, but he had at the end of his table a lettered card -- reading as follows. "No betting allowed upon this table," He further states that he is a poor man with a family to support &amp; that the only means that he has of doing so are derived from his <hi rend="underline">profits</hi> out of his <hi rend="underline">small</hi> "<hi rend="underline">Confectionary Establishment</hi>", that he is entirely unable to pay the fine imposed upon him &amp; if Compelled to do so, he would have to <hi rend="underline">sacrifice</hi> his little stock of goods &amp; thereby deprive himself of the means of supporting his family -- or be confined in the County jail. Wherefore he prays that so much of said fine be remitted, as is not due &amp; belonging to the officers Concerned,</p>
<p>Very Respectfully</p>
