<p>I brought up a petition from prominent Union men of Graves County asking the promotion of Capt T. B Waller he is now the oldest Capt in 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Regt. is a good officer brave and industrious, had the Confidence of Genl Nelson and he &amp; his Company was honored at one time as the badge guard of Nelson had he lived Capt Waller would doubtless have been promoted before this.</p>
<p>The resignation of Maj Buckner makes a vacancy in the Regiment I do hope you will confer this appointment on Capt Waller it would gratify his numerous friends and be the reward of merrit</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>R, K, Williams<pb/></p>
<p>Judge W. K. Williams recommends for promotion Capt. T. B. Waller of 20 Kenty intr</p>
