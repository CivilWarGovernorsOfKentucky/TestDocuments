<lb/>To his Excellency

<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Ky 
<lb/>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Sir</p>
<p>I would respectfully state that while I was keeper of the Ky state Penetentiary The boy in question Jordan the then property of D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> R M Ewing of Scott County Ky was sent to the person where he remained till I left it I think some two or three years during which time his whole conduct was entirily unexeptionable </p>
<p>A short time before I left the prison a move was made for his pardon by petition &amp; otherwise &amp; upon the whole matter being fully laid before his Excellency Gov L W Powell he said to me that he would grant him a pardon but upon a full investigation of the law on the subject found that an act of the legislature was necessary in order to authorize him to do so I learn that the necessary law has been passed &amp; I now most respectfully &amp; urgently ask your favorable consideration of his case<pb/>
<lb/>this I do with a full knowledge of the fact that the citizens of scott county where he was convicted Generally desire the same &amp; I have not heard of the first person objecting</p>
<p>Respectfully yours 
<lb/>N Craig
<lb/>Late Keeper
<lb/>Ky Penitentiary<pb/></p>
