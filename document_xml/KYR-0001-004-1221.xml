<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>Hon Tho's E Bramlette
<lb/>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>Mr Richard Allen has petitioned for relief in two cases of the Cwlth vs him, upon judgments rendered against him ^alone^ as surety upon two forfeited recognizances in the Clark Cir Ct, Since the rendition of said judgments, Mr Allen has caused the arrest of the principals in said cases and they have given new bonds to appear for trial upon the indictments, the papers that accompany this will shew the attitude as well as the names of the parties<pb/>
<lb/>Mr Allen is a very poor hardworking man; and has 9 or 10 small children to support on a small farm of 50 acres in Clark Co, He is a weak minded creature, and in his present condition is an object of pity, We feel sympathy for his helpless children &amp; wife We unite in asking your Excellency to relieve Allen &amp; his family of this <hi rend="str">to them</hi> overwhelming calamity, to them</p>
<p>Very respectfully
<lb/>Yr friend
<lb/>James Simpson
<lb/>Jesse T. Williams
<lb/>Sheriff of C. C.
<lb/>H. P. Whitaker -- 
<lb/>Theodore Kohlhass
<lb/>clerk county court<pb/></p>
<p>I concur in recommending Mr Allens case as a proper one for Executive clemency The facts stated in the foregoing Communication I know are substantially true</p>
