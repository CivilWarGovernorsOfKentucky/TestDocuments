<lb/>Gov B. Magoffin
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>The bearer Charley Petty son of J. A. of this place was taken up &amp; sentenced by the jury to 10 ds. imprisionment in the County jail -- The fact of the case I understand to be about these. Charley &amp; a son of George Morgan got into a quarrell Each of them had a Pistol that they had procured previous to the quarrell for the purpose of shooting Christmas Guns &amp; not with any intention of shooting each other or any <unclear/> They still had them in Possession at the time of the quarrell &amp; similtanously without premeditation drew their Pistols &amp; Charley fired, the other snapped &amp; thus the matter ended. -- Charley is very young &amp; thoughtless to go to jail would be mortifying &amp; wounding<pb/>
<lb/>to the feelings of his most excellent Mother. Charley seems penitent and promises that he will not Carry Pistols or Knives any more &amp; will in future avoid difficulty I think he will keep his promise, and I regard his case in view of his youth a suitable one for the exercise of Executive Clemency -- and most respectfully ask for his Case a favorable Consideration.</p>
<p>With Gr Respt
