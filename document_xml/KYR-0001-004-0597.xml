   <p>To His Excellency the Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your petitioner Brutus J Clay states that on the <date when="1864-03-13">13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of March 1864</date>, while approaching the Bridge En route for the city of Frankfort he saw a pigeon sitting upon the top of the Bridge house and out of mere playfulness threw a rock at it, and it accidentally struck the house without injuring it to any extent whatever &amp; without injuring any person. Thereupon, and without any further provocation from him, <hi rend="underline">Mr Gale</hi>, the Bridge Keeper, got a rock, advanced towards him, denouncing him, and threatened to strike him with the rock. Affiant told him that he must not throw the rock at him; but Gale not desisting immediately, &amp; evincing a purpose to strike affiant with the rock, he (affiant) simply <hi rend="str">a</hi> ^in^ <hi rend="underline">self defense</hi> drew a pistol to meet the threatened assault. Gale then desisted. Affiant did not use the pistol and had no purpose to use it unless neccessarily compelled<pb/>
<lb/>to do so. Gale &amp; affiant were then summoned to answer a breach of the peace before John R Graham Police Judge of Frankfort. When the city atty became advised of the facts the case was dismissed as to affiant, who was next summoned to answer the charge of carrying conceled deadly weapons. Affiant was advised by the City Judge and the city atty. that it was best for him to confess judgment. Being unexperienced he followed there advice and confessed judgt for $50 before said Police Judge_</p>
<p>Affiant now appeals to your Excellency and states that he is not in the habit of carrying concealed deadly weapons is a new school boy, and the way in which he happened the pistol referred to on his person is that he had older persons say (<hi rend="str">De</hi> and he honestly believed them) that it was unsafe for <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> persons to pass the bridge at night without being armed. He had the pistol for no other reason than this and was<pb/></p>
<p>not carrying it for any unlawful purpose He, therefore, asks respectfully that said fine be remitted. The city atty. has remitted his portion.</p>
