   <p>To his excellency, Gov Bramlett.</p>
<p>I have been indicted and fined in the Mason Circuit Court in the following cases.</p>
<p>Commonwealth vs W P Clayton for selling spiritous liquors to Robert Wood -- a minor.</p>
<p>Same vs Same for selling spiritous liquors to Frank Nelson, a minor.</p>
<p>Same vs Same for selling spiritous liquors to George R Gill, a minor.</p>
<p>I keep a tavern in the town of Washington in Mason County; and am a sober man myself and keep an orderly house, as Mr Jefferson will assure you. Mr Jefferson is our sheriff and he will hand you this. In the cases of young Wood and young Nelson, I will make the following statement. <date when="1864-02">Last February</date> the young men applied to me to prepare a supper for them and let them use my house for a ball. I furnished the supper and rooms and they had a dance. It was at this dance, if at all, that these two young men got liquor at my house. I certainly did not let them have it, myself; nor did I really <hi rend="underline">permit</hi> any one else to sell to them. I cannot deny that they drank at my bar; but, if they did, it was without my knoweldge or approval, for I have refused to allow boys to drink at my bar. During the party occasion, to which I have alluded, there was some noise and disturbance and I there upon refused to sell more liquor; and strove then, as I always have, to prevent disorder and misconduct about my house.<pb/>
<lb/>Neither young Nelson nor young Wood got drunk or misbehaved; and if either drank at my bar it was against the rule of my house and when I was not present.</p>
<p>As to young Gill, I will make this statement. He has been permitted to drink at my bar and, I believe, has <hi rend="underline">bought</hi> liquor at it: but he was almost a stranger to me when he did so; and I did not know or think, that he was a minor. He had the appearance and department and associations of a man; and I supposed he was <hi rend="str">such</hi> grown.</p>
<p>He is an educated young gentleman and associated familiarly with gentlemen of mature years, indeed, with many, who are past forty years of age. Such persons were his companions and almost sole associates. They treated him and he them in turn. The above is a full statement of facts, connected with the cases in which I have been fined; and I will be obliged to your excellency, if you will remit such portions of the fines -- 50$ in each case -- as you can.</p>
<p>I do not think my offenses require more punishment, if so much, as the fees and commissions, &amp;c, which I am bound to pay, even with your remission.</p>
<p>I send some statements of my neighbors to which I ask your attention in connection with this</p>
<p>W P. Clayton
<lb/><date when="1864-12-23">Dec 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 1864.</date><pb/></p>
<p>I am well acquainted with Mr Clayton and do hope you will remit the fines assessed against him by so doing you you will not only confer a great favour on him but on his numerous friends Mr Clayton keeps I think a very orderly house as a general thing using his best efforts to keep good order</p>
