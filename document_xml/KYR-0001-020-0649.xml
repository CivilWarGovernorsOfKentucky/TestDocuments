<p>He states that he is no gambler and does gamble for money and has not since that time gambled with anyone -- </p>
<p>He states that he is very poor and has a family to support -- and thus <hi rend="str">t</hi>has not property sufficient to pay this <unclear/> debt -- He states that he has worked for the circuit court clerk and paid him part of the costs -- and he will be greatly destressed or have to go to jail if ^he^ gets not relief</p>
