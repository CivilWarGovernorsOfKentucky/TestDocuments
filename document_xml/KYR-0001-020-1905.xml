   <p>To his Excellency 
<lb/>Beriah Magoffin 
<lb/>Gov. Ky. </p>
<p>We would respectfully represent to your Excellency that on the <date when="1860-03-24">24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of March 1860</date> the Grand Jury of Madison County Indicted George Stafford for carrying concealed weapons and also for unlawful gaming. William Tillet appeared with Stafford and entered as bail for him in the sum of one hundred Dollars in each case. At the <gap/> term of the Madison Circuit ^Court^ Stafford failed to appear to answer to the Indictment and both bonds were forfeited. At the last March term of the Madison Circuit Court M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Tillet filed Affidavits and letters showing that he had used every effort to have Stafford arrested and brought back he having gone to some distant county in the State Grant perhaps. the same papers go to show that since the forfeiture Stafford has departed this life. We have no hesitation in recommending Mr. Tillet to executive clemency and earnestly ask your Excellency to remit the forfeitures except fees and costs. He is a very honest poor man<pb/>
<lb/>with scarcely any means or property. He is in every respect so far as we know or have heard a very worthy good citizen and we ask your Excellecy to relieve him from a great hardship. </p>
