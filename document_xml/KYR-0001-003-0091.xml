   <p>Head-Quarters District of Kentucky,
<lb/>5TH DIVISION, 23D ARMY CORPS,
<lb/>Lexington, <date when="1864-05-22">May 22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> 1864</date>.
<lb/>Governor -- </p>
<p>You will soon have drafted men at your disposal for assignment to three years Regiments -- </p>
<p>I recommend that the 26<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky. Veteran Vo<hi rend="sup">ls</hi> be at once filled up to the Maximum. It has done Much service, and has received less favors, and far less consideration than any army regiment sent from the state, by the authorities of Kentucky -- It has fought will, and has behaved itself well in the field, in the camps and in the garrison. The officers and Men of the Reg<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> feel that the state authorities have neglected them, and whilst they have concealed it from the public, have expressed it to their<pb/>
<lb/>friends.</p>
<p>The Regiment as you are aware, after enlisting as veterans consolidated with the 33<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rd</hi></hi> Ky. Many men were recruited by the officers of the 26<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> and now they number something over 700 men -- </p>
<p>The Regt has been under orders for some days to proceed to the front. I have detached it by authority until troops can be had to suply its place. This will give time to drill and decepline the drafted men assigned to it; before going to the front Col Maxwell of this Regt is at Bowling Green with four Companies and Leut Col Farleigh at Louisville with six companies, to Either of which place you would much oblige me, and them, and the Regiment by sending what men you can -- </p>
<p>I am Sir Very Respt &amp;C
