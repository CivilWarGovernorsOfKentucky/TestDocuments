<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Your favour of the <date when="---26">26<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi></date> inst is received and in reply would say that the crime for which Moody was convicted was forgeing the name of a party to a letter to me directing me to pay him some money ($250<hi rend="sup">00</hi>/<hi rend="sub">00</hi>) which I done. When he was arrested he acknowledged the whole matter and when tried plead guilty, I feel a great sympathy for him and from all I can learn he is truly penitent, and I feel satisfied if pardoned he will be an honorable Man, his family are very respectable. I have <hi rend="str">a</hi> letters from his father and Mother living in Michigan written previous to his conviction. I hope the Go<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">v</hi></hi> will find his case one demanding his Executive Clemency and that Moody may yet become an honorable citizen</p>
<p>Your Friend Truly
