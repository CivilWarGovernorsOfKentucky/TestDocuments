<p>By request of the council for the defence in the case of the Commonwealth vs Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. Woodward. Indicted for ^the^ Murder of Chris. Baker. I transmit to you a copy of the Testimony of James Cole. before the coroners Jury Ja<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Cole Being Sworn (and who was the only witness I could Procure at the time who Knew any thing about the case) "Says that I was in the Bar room this morning." (Said Bar room is on the South west corner of Fulton &amp; Campbell Streets, Coroner) When Baker came in and commenced abusing the Landlord. Thos Woodward told him that he ^Baker^ ought not to do so that he Baker had been sick at the house and been well taken care of. Baker Remarked that he could whip the Landlord and <hi rend="str">any</hi> or of his friends by this time he was out on the side Walk. Woodward went up to him and Put his hand on his shoulder and tried to Pasefy him, Baker said to him if you are one<pb/>
<lb/>of his friends. God Damn you you are the man I want to see or get at at the same time running his hand in his Bosom as though he was going to draw a weapon as he did so Woodward drew a knife and Stabed him. James Cole was a Stranger to boath Parties he lived about one Hundred miles from the city. Since the killing I have been informed he has been killed by Guerillas</p>
