   <p>To Gov. Beriah Magoffin</p>
<p>Your petitioners would represent to your excelency that at this present term of the Caldwell Circuit Court William Campbell upon an indictment ^was^ tried &amp; found guilty of tipling &amp; his fine assessed at $60. We represent to your exelency that in behalf of Mr Campbell, that he is an old man about Seventy Six years of age, who has seen better days, but now in poverty, &amp; with the infirmities of age upon him, obtains a precarious support by selling ardent spirits, &amp; has in this instance over stepped &amp; violated the laws of the land; In his behalf we will say, that in the last war against England he was a Soldier &amp; performed his duty, &amp; we think that before your exelency it is allowable to set up his services to his country, his misfortunes &amp; the infirmities of his age as an equalable set of that Mr Campbell may be allowed to plead before your exelency, against the payment of this fine to the Commonwealth of Ky. &amp; we trust that your exelency will deem it consistant with propriety &amp; what is due to the state to remit the said fine agianst the said <gap/> Campbell. and oblige yours respectfully.</p>
