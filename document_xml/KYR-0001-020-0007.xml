   <p>To His Excellency, Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Govenor of the Commonwealth of Ky.</p>
<p>Dear Sir -- We the undersigned citizens of Caldwell County Ky. have long known Thomas. B. Wadlington &amp; he has ever been considered a good &amp; true hearted citizen Known &amp; noted for his industry &amp; his peaceable &amp; orderly conduct -- The difficulty in which he was engaged with Milton A. Cartwright, did not appear to us to be of his seeking, nor are we satisfied ^or do believe^ that the case was fairly presented to the jury, as it occured.</p>
<p>We hope your Excellency will review the case and give the poor man the benefit of every doubt, and we desire that his case may be judged of in mercy &amp; regarded with favor, and that your Excellency will take into consideration every circumstance that ought to operate in his behalf. And we desire ^that^ your Excellency ^<hi rend="str">that</hi>^may be pursuaded that it is consistent with your duty to extend to him Executive Clemency and that his life may be spared, either by a full pardon or by a commutation of his punishment -- </p>
<p><date when="1861-01-22">Jany 22 1861</date>,
<lb/>Yours respectfully
<lb/>Jesse George<pb/>
