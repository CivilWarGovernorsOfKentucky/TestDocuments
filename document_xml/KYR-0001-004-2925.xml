   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E Bramlette
<lb/>Gov" of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Samuel Bishop states that two of his sons W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> L and H. W. Bishop and the son of his neighbor, Marion Porter unfortunately on the <date when="--12-01">1 Dec<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi></date> last became involved in a fight -- while working the road -- for which they were each fined Thirty Dollars=One of his sons is just arrived at age and has no property -- the other and Porter are minors -- The difficulty originated as stated on the road -- before that all were friendly with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hall -- He lives a neighbor to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hall and between themselves and their families the friendliest relations have always existed -- </p>
<p>He says he is a small farmer of small means and feels himself unable to pay the fines -- This he will be forced to do rather than see them go to prison -- His sons have never been in any difficulty before this and he is encouraged to hope will not be again -- as stated in their petition and in the statement of Fox the Magistrate, the Jury who fined them were improperly gotten up. one half of them being the kinsmen of the prosecutor.. He prays that you will remit the fines -- </p>
<p>Yours respectfully
<lb/>Sam ^his X mark^ Bishop<pb/></p>
<p>The undersigned Citizens of Bullitt County state they know Sam<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Bishop -- He is a small farmer of limited means -- a good, quiet citizen and every way worthy of confidence -- We feel from his statement of his sons' trouble that it presents a proper object for Executive clemency -- They join in his petition to his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky for a remission of the fines -- </p>
