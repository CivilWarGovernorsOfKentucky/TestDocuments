   <p>Warsaw, Gallatin Co., Ky.,
<lb/><date when="1864-03-16">March 16, 1864.</date>
<lb/>Governor Bramlette:</p>
<p>Wm. Ross perpetrated the most outrageous murder on the person of Wm. H. Kelly, in this county, in <date when="1859-07">July, 1859</date>. There had been some dispute between the parties about the sale of a tract of land. Kelly was plowing in his field, not knowing that any one was near him. Ross concealed himself in ambush near the fence, and as Kelly turned his plow at the end of the furrow, Ross shot him in the back with his gun, from long range, and killed him instantly.</p>
<p>Ross was indicted for murder, arrested and put in the Gallatin County Jail. He only remained in Jail a short time when he broke the jail and made his escape. The Governor offered a reward of $250, and some parties captured him on Big Sandy, near the Virginia line.</p>
<p>He was brought back here in placed in Jail again, where he remained some months, when by the aid of some accomplices outside, he had a hole made through the entire wall of the Jail, and escaped again, and is now at large in the State of Missouri.</p>
<p>At the instance of the father of the deceased I send you the request of our Circuit Judge, asking you to offer another reward for his arrest -- and also make a riquisition upon the Governor of Missouri for his return.<pb/>
<lb/>I send also a certified copy of the indictment, and request that you will appoint Wm. Sams, of Carrollton, Ky., Agent on behalf of the State of Kentucky. I know Mr. Sams to be active and faithful, and has lately been engaged to some extent in this business.</p>
<p>Please send the Papers to me at Carrollton, as I will be there at Court in a few days.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully,
<lb/>John L. Scott,
<lb/>Com. atty.</p>
