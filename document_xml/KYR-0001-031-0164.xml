<lb/>H. C. Pindell Esq.
<lb/>Louisville, Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I take the liberty to enclose to you my Circular as Commissioner of New York many other States. &amp; to request of you the favor to present my name to the Governor of Kentucky for a similar appointment from your State. I do this in the hope that the fraternal bonds which as yet have held the Sister States of the West &amp; North together may never be broken. Now gloriously &amp; through how much suffering your gallant State has done &amp; is doing its duty! Could we but exercise this<pb/> 
<lb/>foul demise of fanaticism, which seems to have taken possession of the Federal administration, all might yet be well. But my anxiety, perhaps too often borders on despair. I see far too few signs of hope that the radical portions of the North will ever confess their past infidelity to the Consitution or realize their mad designs upon all that is most dear to us under it. There is a growing reaction at the North in favor of a sound conservatism, thanks being due in no small part to the temperate laurels &amp; gallant patriotism of Kentucky. If this saves us not, all I fear is lost. Excuse me for sending herewith a copy of the Boston Courier containing an article overly intent, which gives the sentiments more in full if not a few Northern minds.</p>
<p>Very truly &amp;c
<lb/>Jos. L. Lord<pb/></p>
<p>JOSEPH L. LORD
<lb/>Counsellor at Law,
<lb/>NO. 20 STATE STREET,....BOSTON,
<lb/>COMMISSIONER
<lb/>FOR
<lb/>All the New-England States,
<lb/>NEW-YORK,
<lb/>WESTERN, AND OTHER STATES.</p>
