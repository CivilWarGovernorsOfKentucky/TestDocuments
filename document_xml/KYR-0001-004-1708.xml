<p>I was in Hopkinsville a few days ago, and defended Mr. J. Torian under a charge of keeping a Gambling house, I say defended him, I represented him as atty at his request &amp; during the progress of the trial, he told me all about the case &amp; I advised him to confess the charge &amp; he did so, &amp; I took it on my self to investigate his case outside &amp; I learned that he was once reached by his frd's using his room in substance as stated by him in his petition to you for relief Torian is a young man of good moral character of good family, but poor<pb/></p>
<p>I made no charge vs him for what I did for him, &amp; do hope you may feel justified in remitting his fine the Commonwealth's Atty fees &amp; the other cost will be as much as he can raise, I am satisfied that your act will be approved by the community -- </p>
<p>Respectfully --
