   <p>Montgomery County
<lb/>State of Kentucky, Sct.</p>
<p>James H. Trimble being sworn says he is Deputy Sheriff for the County above named. That he has known W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> S. Wills for twenty odd years. That he is a very clever man &amp;. citizen, and that it would be a hard case were he compelled to pay the $500, on the Bond of Geo. Hedger. That he is a poor man. That Robt Hedger is insolvent. That said Wills lived in the upper part of this County: but was robbed by the Guerillas, and by fear was compelled to leave the Co. and move to Bath. That this affiant is informed that said wills has been robbed some two or three times since his removal to said County of Bath &amp; State of Kentucky</p>
<p>That it is certainly a case calling for Executive clemency.</p>
