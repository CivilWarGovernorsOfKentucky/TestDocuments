<p>The Govenor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky your Petitioner John W Hazelrigg would state one William Stepanson who had been a federal soldier had servd. one year in the 14" Kentucky Cavalry &amp; who was discharged some time last spring was charged with horse stealing &amp; before the court of enquiry was held to Bail in the sum of $300= for his appearance at the next Term of the Montgomery circuit court &amp; your Petitioner being moved with Simpathy for the soldier -- &amp; not believing him guilty went his security in said bale bond he failed to appear in discharge of his reconisance &amp; the same was forfeited &amp; at the <date when="1864-08">present August Term</date> of said court There was a Judgment against your petitioner on said bond for the $300= Your petitioner has been informed that said Stepenson went to the state of Ohio &amp; again Joined the service of the United States for three years &amp; is now in actual service in a regiment of Ohio volunteers your petitioner says that stepenson has a family wife &amp; some 5 childrin &amp; is a very poor man &amp; your Petitioner has been driven from his home &amp; his property destroyed by the <hi rend="underline">Rebels</hi> &amp; it will be verry oppressive on him to have said fine to pay -- wherefore he asks your Excellency to Remit said Judgment &amp; will ever pray</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Jno. W Hazelrigg</hi></p>
<p>The facts are as stated by Mr Hazelrigg. &amp; I would further state that Mr Hazelrigg had some $8000 worth of property destroyed by the rebels, &amp; as he has been such a sufferer lately, &amp; went the bail through zeal for the Union cause, Stephenson being a Union soldier, why, I think it would be right to remit the Judgement.</p>

<p>I prosecuted Mr Stephenson in the Examining court by Employment &amp; certify that Col. Hazelrigg became Stephenson's security only after very many appeals from the family of Stephenson<pb/>
<lb/>I consider it a case where the Executive clemency could be properly exercised Mr Stephenson was a member of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky. Cav. U.S.A.</p>
