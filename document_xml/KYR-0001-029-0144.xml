<p>I certify that I have known Mr K Kramer for several years. he has been a tenant of mine for some time. I have always known him to be a hard working man yet occasionally would indulge in intoxicating Liquors. I would suppose that from what I know of him that the act he was committed for, was done while under the influence of Liquor, his wife is afflicted and is almost destitute and depended upon him for support</p>
