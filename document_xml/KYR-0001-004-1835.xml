   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette 
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Trigg County would respectfully represent to your Excellency that at the <date when="1864-02">February term 1864</date> of the Trigg Circuit Court, Judgment was rendered against John M. Darnell in favor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky for the sum of Seven hundred and thirty Dollars &amp; costs on a suit in behalf of the Commonwealth against said Darnell to recover the amount of certain property alleged to have been won by said Darnall of one Isaac Greenwade, on the result of the Presidential election of <date when="1856">1856.</date> Your petitions say that they are well acquainted with said Darnell, know him to be a good and worthy citizen, and obedient to the laws; they feel satisfied that the excitement of the canvass of <date when="1856">1856,</date> was the cause of his violating the law against betting on Elections; that he won of said Greenwade a sum of money which was afterwards discharged in Mules at a heavy price, they say further that in <date when="1861">1861</date>, about 5 years afterwards, Greenwade sued said Darnell for the same, in the Trigg Circuit Court, and that his petition was dismissed, &amp; the Commonwealth instituted sent &amp; recovered judgment as stated above: They say, and confidently believe that s<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Darnell would have made restitution of the property won, to Greenwade, or would satisfy the Judgment in favor of the Commonwealth, had he been able to do so at the time, or if he were able now; but they say he is a<pb/>
<lb/>poor man, with a large family wholly dependent upon his labor for their support, and that to force payment of the judgment would operate as a great hardship upon himself and family, the premises considered we earnestly pray your Excellency to remit so much of the judgment as may be accruing to the Commonwealth, and as in duty bound we will ever pray &amp;c.</p>
<p>W. G. Bryant</p>
<p>As Circuit Judge I rendered the above Judgmt. vs Mr. Darnall and believe he is a poor man and labors for a Support. the facts stated above I suppose are true.</p>
