<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir.</p>
<p>There was a letter written to Governor Magoffin just before his resignation by myself &amp; other citizens of Carlisle recommending the appointment of John M. Chives as a justice of the peace of Nicholas County in the place of myself resigned, the letter was written some 2 weeks since and no appointmend or commission having been sent on, I concluded that the thing had been overlooked by him, and I would be glad you would suggest the matter to Governor Robinson and request him to make the appointment, there are divers expectations &amp; other business that should be attended to immediately and hop the matter will be attended to forthwith. If the letter of resignation should not have come to hand the appointment will be for the Carlisle district N<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">o</hi></hi> 4</p>
<p>Yours with respect.

<p>The writer is a good Union man and the man he recommends is a good and true man.</p>
