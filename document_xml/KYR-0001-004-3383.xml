   <p>To His Excellency Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> E Bramlette
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner urgently asks executive clemency upon the following statement. He states that at the <date when="1864-03">March Term of the Ohio Circuit Court 1864</date> Judgements were rendered against his son Jonathan Railey upon five indictments- 2 for selling liquor to minors, one for gaming on his premises &amp; gaming in his house, &amp; one for breach of tavern bond- Selling liquor to minors is explained by the affidavits of the fathers of said boys filed herewith. The breach of the tavern bond was the gaming and selling liquors to minors My son Jonathan Railey was living in a very poor part of the country and wild part of the country and was induced to go to tavern keeping and being young himself was not so throughtful as he should have been and could not well take the same control that another or older person could and he should. I have every reason to believe that the liquor to the miners was given because he thought it was legal. I thought it was. The costs have been paid in the above cases and I have apearred to pay the Comwths atty his part. I becam surety for my son in a Replevin bond for the balance who was unable to pay. He rendered himself to the sheriff who was going to put him in Jail and when I heard of it to<pb/>
<lb/>prevent that I went his bail or Repleved it notwithstanding to pay it under about break me up- I am now near sixty years old am poor and have been all my life and to pay this would about strip me. My son is not able to pay and physically badly disabled and he will do well to maintain himself in this life and <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> meet the ordinary wants and cares of life-</p>
<p>I feel that I am now too old to turn out, Losing by soldiers company near me been stripped of almost everything. The object of this is to plead that you would remit these fines, thereby letting me and son out. He has quit tavern keeping or having anything to do with whisky- I have simply made a plain unvarnished statement. I claim to be an honest man though very poor. A quiet law abiding one.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> W H Miller Representative from this country and M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> H D M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Henry both know me &amp; to them I would refer. Trusting that your Excellency can interpose and that at your earliest convenience I am </p>
<p>Most Respectfully
<lb/>Jonathan ^his X mark^ Railey</p>
