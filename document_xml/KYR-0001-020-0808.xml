  <body>
   <p>To His Excellency Governor Magoffin.</p>
<p>Your petitioner having been fined $7.65 ^costs &amp; all^ by the City Court of Lexington on the <date when="1861-01-07">7<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> or <date when="1861-01-08">8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of January</date> for being intoxicated on the street, would respectfully state that he is a very poor man and that he is scarcely able during these hard times to make a living. He would also state that as this is the first time he has asked Executive clemency, it will also be the last. It is very difficult for him to procure enough work to keep him from suffering, and it would be almost impossible for him to pay the fine. If it is necessary he could procure the signatures of many responsible persons to this petition, but he prefers trusting his case with the explanations and promise to the kindness of your Excellency. He prays therefore that your Excellency will kindly remit the fine imposed.</p>
