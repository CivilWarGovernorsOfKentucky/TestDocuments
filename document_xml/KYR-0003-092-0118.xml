<lb/><date when="1861-10-20">Oct 20, 1861</date>.
<lb/>My Dear Ann</p>
<p>I am still at this place, and am now with Genl Buckner, as a volunteer aid. and you can say to Stoddard, that I see his uncle <hi rend="str">th</hi> Genl <hi rend="str">J</hi>A. S. Johnston every day and that I am still as much pleased with him as I was. He and Buckner are both men whom I both admire, as honest and great; this combination of the great and good is so rare in these days, that I enjoy their society -- <hi rend="str">q</hi> much -- I mean that I love to be with such men, and not that <hi rend="underline">I</hi> belong to either the one or the other class</p>
<p>It would evidently be wrong to write <hi rend="underline">any</hi> thing connected with the movement of th army here and knowing this out, I can have but little to say to you. I expect however to be with you much sooner than Lincoln and his minions may devise.</p>
<p>I mess with Gen<hi rend="sup">L</hi> Buckner, who has in his military Family a number of gentlemen with whom I am greatly pleased. Gen<hi rend="sup">L</hi> B. goes to see his wife ^only^ once a week, although she is in this place. I mention this to show<pb/>
<lb/>how fully he is occupied. We all sleep in the same house now, and in the field will still be in the same mess.</p>
<p>My dear Wife, I never knew til now how much you constituted as it were a part of my own life. How enexpressibly dear are the pleasure's of home, and the love of wife and children. Where the passions of men or devils I hardly know which, disturb and convulse society, then come back to the mind, pictures of the pleasures of Home, which delight the mind. How insignificant by the side of these, appear the ordinary pleasures of life -- the pursuit of money or <unclear/> of honour and fame. It is astounding at times, to find how clearly we perceive that the useful is superior to the grand and ^the^ fine.</p>
<p>No letter from home yet. I know that you have written to me, perhaps often, but none have reached me. I long for a letter from you. Write on fine thin paper and inclose it to "<hi rend="underline">Mary L. Johnson</hi>, care of Tyler and Martin Louisville Ky" and request her to have it forwarded to me, with her letters to Charley Johnson, who is now<pb/>
<lb/>and is Gen<hi rend="sup">L </hi>Buckner aid. It will probably reach me in this way.</p>
<p>You must manage my affairs in Kentucky in any way you think best, I can give you no instructions, except to provide what you need by the sale of any thing I have. Consult your Father, and do whatever you wish except this -- You are never to give up your property to to my creditors. If you do so, you will embitter my whole life. It is neither demanded by honour or law and I insist that you shall not do it, for your own sake. I have often felt a presentament in the midst of prosperity, that I was destined to bring you probably to want and I still fear.</p>
<p>Give my love to my neighbours, to your family, and to my children. God knows that I seek his favour and protection for you every night and day. I am compelled to close as it is now near 12 o'clock p.m. and the opportunity of sending by a man who goes tomorrow is all I have now to hope for some days. They are closing the office and the <unclear/> with <unclear/> by day light.</p>
<p>Your affectionate Husband
<lb/>George W Johnson<pb/></p>
