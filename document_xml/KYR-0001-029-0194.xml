A man came and swore out A warrant and the youth became Alarmed and came forward <hi rend="str">and confessed</hi>and confessed Judgement the Judgement Rendered was for ten dollars being the lowest amount ,Those present think he did little or no wrong And have gotten up A petition to your Honor for his Relief All of which is Respectfully Submitted. I am sir very Respectfully &amp;c</p>
