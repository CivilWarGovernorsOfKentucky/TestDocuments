<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Gov. Magoffin:</p>
<p>Send weeks Since we sent you the Petition of names -- our citizens of this County asking you to release a fine imposed by the Meade Circuit Court on Ge<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">o</hi></hi> W. &amp; Pa. Webb of $200. for Suffering gameing on their wharf boat. The Petition Set forth the facts of the case: -- They were Keepers of a wharf boat lying at the Brandenburg wharf, and without a Knowledge of the Law permitted persons who were waiting for boats to play at Euchre for Cigars, drinks &amp;C. For this they were indicted &amp; being advised that they had even in what they did, violated the Law, confessed Judgment -- the Jury found the Comth sum $200. These facts are attested by many Citizens who sign the petition we sent.</p>
<p>We hope your Excellency will not punish a man because he was ignorant of Law, but will remit whatever of the fine you Can. Certainly the Comlths atty. for $60. &amp; the Costs is as much as a man Should pay for not knowing the Law.</p>
<p>The Webbs are good citizens, Ener-<pb/>
<lb/>getic, industrious, &amp; honest. They have sold their wharf boat and it would cripple them very much to pay the fine.</p>
<p>We would call your Excellency's attention to the fact that the Judge signs the Petition together with all the Jury.</p>
<p>We hope you will Extend your clemency to this case, Knowing that it will meet the approbation of our citizens &amp; be a well bestowed act of Executive power.</p>
<p>Very Respct &amp; c
