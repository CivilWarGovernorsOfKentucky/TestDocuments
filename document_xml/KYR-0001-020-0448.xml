   <p>Covington Ky -- <date when="1861-01-11">Jany. 11 1861</date>
<lb/>To the Governor of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>At the present winter term of the Kenton Circuit court, your petitioner, Jos Ranson was fined fifty dollars for illegal voting -- </p>
<p>He has been a citizen &amp; resident of Covington for many years -- &amp; had often voted in his ward or precinct -- </p>
<p>That some short time before the election the precinct was altered -- so as to place him in a deferent precinct -- Without knowing of this change -- he voted, at his usual place of voting -- </p>
<p>There was no question or charge that he was not a citizen &amp; voter -- The mistake as to the ward or precinct was the only charge -- </p>
<p>He asks that the fine may be remitted -- </p>
<p>Jos. Ranson</p>
<p>I am familiar with the facts, heard on the trial above refered to -- they are correctly stated -- </p>
<p>I have known M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Ranson, personally for many years -- He has been for a long time a citizen of Covington -- &amp; a voter -- &amp; has resided <hi rend="str">at</hi> in the house -- for several years -- </p>
