<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I arrived in the city late yesterday evening with dispatches from Senator Johnson, which I have left with Col. B. M. West.</p>
<p>My mission being to transport arms for Col Tilghman's district, and failing to obtain them, I have determined to leave this evening for Louisville, where I shall remain Several days, and if your Excellency desires to Send dispatches to my section of the state by me, you will please send them to me at Louisville care Mess Kean Steele &amp; Judge proprietors &amp;c. It will perhaps be the safer plan to Send them by me, since the mails beyond Louisville are seriously deranged.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be
<lb/>Your Excl<hi rend="sup">ency's </hi>obt svt
<lb/>R. Cobb
<lb/>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Lieut K, S, G,</p>
<p>His Excellency
<lb/>B. Magoffin,
<lb/>Frankfort.
<lb/><note place="footer">over</note><pb/></p>
<p>In addition to Senator Johnson's dispatches I enclose the letter of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> J. A Gardner to him in response to the note of the Senator to Mr G_ I had the good fortune to see M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gardner on my way from Union City to Clarksville Tenn, and he very kindly offered me the copy of his letter which I send you -- Consenting to its publication if your Excellency should see proper to do so -- He desired me however to return the copy to him at Gardner. P. O. Your Excellency will therefore please have a copy taken and Send the other to me either at Louisville, or at my place of Residence -- Eddyville Lyon Co Ky.</p>
<p>truly &amp;c
<lb/>Cobb</p>
