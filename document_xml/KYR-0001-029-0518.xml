<lb/>of the Mayor who issued the License. The establishment of  is in <persName ref="cwgk:N00000458">C. W. Roback</persName>, and Petitioner acted as his driver in bringing over his Bitters to various persons in the , and believed that under the License of Mr Roback which Petitioner carried with him, and on which was endorsed that he was the Agent of Mr Roback, that he was legally authorized to do so under the instructions of the Mayor. <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001208">Cincinnati, Ohio</placeName><placeName ref="cwgk:P00000936">City of Covington</placeName></p>

<p>I was acting for the County Atty in prosecuting the defendant, The facts are correctly set forth in the above. I am of the opinion that petitioners employer was misled by the Mayor -- that had he not been informed that his driver could peddle under his employer's License &amp; that the offense would not have been committed hence I ask that the fine be remitted.</p>
