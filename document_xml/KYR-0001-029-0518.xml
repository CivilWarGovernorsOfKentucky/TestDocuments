   <p>To His Excellency, James F Robinson -- 
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your Petitioner respectfully represents that he is the Driver or Agent for C. W. Roback in the Sale of "Roback's Bitters," and was arrested while so employed in the City of Covington and fined $50 and costs. He showed a City License to C W Roback to peddle said Bitters in said city on which was an endorsement that Petitioner was the Agent of said Roback. The Magistrate however decided that no one but Mr Roback himself could drive the waggon and furnish said Bitters in said City, and differed with the City Mayor in the Construction of the City ordinance. Petitioner sends herewith the statements of the Mayor, Magistrate and Hon J F Fisk the acting County Attorney, who join in the prayer of this Petitioner to have said fine cancelled and your Petitioner pardoned. Your Petitioner was tried before B Eggleston J. P. K C and it is admitted that if said Magistrate decided the law correctly, that the offence was caused by the mistaken advice<pb/>
<lb/>of the Mayor who issued the License. The establishment of C. W. Roback is in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Petitioner acted as his driver in bringing over his Bitters to various persons in the City of Covington, and believed that under the License of Mr Roback which Petitioner carried with him, and on which was endorsed that he was the Agent of Mr Roback, that he was legally authorized to do so under the instructions of the Mayor. </p>
<p>Your Petitioner respectfully prays that said penalty or fine be cancelled by the exercise of the Executive Clemency. And your Petitioner will ever pray -- </p>
<p>W. H. <unclear>Schmoddle</unclear>
<lb/>Covington <date when="1863-08-06">August 6, 1863</date>.</p>
<p>I was acting for the County Atty in prosecuting the defendant, The facts are correctly set forth in the above. I am of the opinion that petitioners employer was misled by the Mayor -- that had he not been informed that his driver could peddle under his employer's License &amp; that the offense would not have been committed hence I ask that the fine be remitted.</p>
