He showed a City License to C W Roback to peddle said Bitters in said city on which was an endorsement that Petitioner was the Agent of said Roback.

P. <persName ref="cwgk:N00000460">J F Fisk</persName><persName ref="cwgk:N00000457">Your Petitioner</persName> and it is admitted that if said Magistrate decided the law correctly, that the offence was caused by the mistaken advice<persName ref="cwgk:N00000960">B Eggleston</persName><orgName ref="cwgk:O00000645">K C</orgName><pb/>
<lb/>of the Mayor who issued the License. The establishment of  is in , and Petitioner acted as his driver in bringing over his Bitters to various persons in the , and believed that under the License of Mr Roback which Petitioner carried with him, and on which was endorsed that he was the Agent of Mr Roback, that he was legally authorized to do so under the instructions of the Mayor. <persName ref="cwgk:N00000458">C.

<p>I was acting for the County Atty in prosecuting the defendant, The facts are correctly set forth in the above. I am of the opinion that petitioners employer was misled by the Mayor -- that had he not been informed that his driver could peddle under his employer's License &amp; that the offense would not have been committed hence I ask that the fine be remitted.</p>
