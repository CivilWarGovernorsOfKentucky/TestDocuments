<p>We cordially endorse the application of James E Neil to be released from the fine for Gaming. From our acquaintance we are free to state that M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Neil is a <hi rend="underline">true</hi> <hi rend="underline">man</hi> to his country, and a man that would not wilfully violate the laws of the land.</p>

<p>The above names are of the best citizens in the county, their recommendation entitled to great consideration. I know Neil well- The fine<pb/>
<lb/>is very <hi rend="underline">oppressive</hi> on him. He is poor &amp; has to struggle for a bare living &amp; is in many respects a clever fellow &amp; usefull to his friends &amp; is a l<hi rend="underline">oya</hi>l man</p>
<p>Jn<hi rend="sup">o</hi> B. Huston</p>
<p>The Judgement named in the petition was respited, but Executive issued for attos, Clks &amp; Shffs fees leaving only $140 imposed, being the portion going to the State &amp; that is now for collection in Sheriffs hands</p>
