<lb/>His Excellency Beriah Magoffin Governor of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>Your Excellency is advised that one William Stewart convicted upon a charge of Burglary is a Suitable subject for Executive clemency-</p>
<p>William Stewart is about twenty years of age of prepossessing manners and appearance and of great gentleness of deportment -- He has resided in this city about thirte^en^ years having no relative but a younger brother, both natives of Ireland -- He is poor and was dependent entirely upon his trade for a support -- </p>
<p>During his residence here he has been very remarkable for his exemplary conduct, his amiability and his industry and assiduity in business. His honesty had never for a moment been suspected.</p>
<p>He is a Sign and house painter by trade! but when not engaged at his trade he had been engaged closely at his books and was an intense student -- His object was to support himself and brother, acquire knowledge and improve his mind -- </p>
<p>About a year ago he was attacked so violently with inflam^m^ation of the eyes that he had to quit work -- This disease was perhaps caused by much reading by Candlelight or perhaps by lead-poison incident to his trade -- Having got better he resumed his business but the national calamities again three him out of employment and he was destitute -- Finding himself then indebted to a poor landlady with whom he had boarded and unable to pay he became melancholy, dejected and seemed to be verging upon insanity. Some of his Friends believed him insane -- </p>
<p>Whilst in this mood and under these circumstances he entered a dwelling house in this city -- He was discovered and easily taken -- He told the parties who took him, that he<pb/>
<lb/>wanted to obtain money to pay his board. That he could ^not^ control his feelings -- that he was obliged to have money to pay his board -- </p>
<p>The undersigned who defended him on his trial, believed him to have labored under a fit of temporary insanity -- If they could have obtained a Continuance of the cause they are advised they could have established the fact -- But a continuance was impossible. &amp; his Jury however in Consideration of the possibilty of his derangement, and ^of^ his excellent character and habits, find his term of service in the penetentiary at the lowest figure due the crime of Burglary, three years -- </p>
<p>His attorneys believe from every fact developed in the case that he was temporarily insane, and would have been as likely to have committed Suicide as Burglary -- Your Excellency is referred to the case of the celebrated Hugh Miller of Scotland, who during the last year, from intense study and a fixed melancholy, committed suicide. They further believe that this young man by proper treatment may be restored and become one ornament to his circle of friends -- They pray a <hi rend="underline">pardon</hi> and will ever so -- </p>
<p>R. F. Baird
<lb/>J. Hobson Price} Atto<hi rend="sup">s</hi> -- for William Stewart -- </p>
<p>We the undersigned members of Jury in the case of the aforesaid William Stewart ask your Excellency to pardon him.</p>
