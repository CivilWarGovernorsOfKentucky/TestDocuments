   <p>To His Excellency B. Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>Your Petitioner Asa Beason states that at the <date when="1860-09">September</date> term of the Taylor circuit court he was fined on a indictment in that court for an assault the sum of thirty five dollars that he has been compelled to replevy the said fine and have to pay the same in short time unless relieved by your excellency, that he was not present at the trial of the indictment and was deprived thereby from making a defence which he thought was good and if made would have acquitted him, that he was first assaulted by the person on whom he was charged with assaulting, that he is a very poor man and a wife several small children who are depending on him for a support -- that it would be a hardship on his helpless family to sell what little property he has, to make said fine<pb/>
<lb/>that it would leave them without the means of support. Wherefore he prays that your Excellency remit the said fine</p>
<p>Asa Branson</p>
