   <p>Gov. Ky. <date when="1861-06-27">June 27'/61 -- </date>
<lb/>Dear Gov.</p>
<p>By the request of M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Alexander who has a son in the Penetentiary, I write the following letter -- I was counsel for him at the last <date when="1860-12">Dec.</date> term of this court and defended him, on a charge of stabing with intent to kill -- A <unclear>German</unclear> by the name of Overland was stabed, and on trial swore that Alexander had done it_ One M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Biggs swore he heard the fuss, and saw Leaughter &amp; Alexander going in that direction just before the difficulty. Upon this testimony with <unclear/> of Minor importance he was sentenced for two years &amp; a half -- Now the facts are about as follows as I learned them, after the trial<pb/>
<lb/>Alexander, Leaughter, and one of Alexanders little Brothers about twelve or thirteen years of age. left a hotel, and proceeded up the street together, when they came opposite these <unclear/>, Leaughter passed over the street and began the difficulty, got into a fight with them, and this youngest Alexander passed over to him, the one in prison, as stated to me by two ladies who saw him never crossed the street atall until after the fuss was over They heard and saw the most of the affair -- And believe as they were willing to swear that Hiram Alexander did not do the cuting. In fact, between you and me as I understand the cuting was done by an other boy not by the one in prison. these facts<pb/>
<lb/>came to my knowledge after his trial and upon them I asked for a new trial, but the court overruled the motion because an <unclear/> <unclear/> not been used by Alexander -- The <unclear>German</unclear> according to the proof acknowledged two or three times that he did not know who cut him but swore on the trial that it was the prisoner -- I think he was mistaken, &amp; believe from what I know that the stabing was done by another -- </p>
<p>Under these circumstances it would not be inconsistant with justice and right that this young man should be released, and I trust from these facts, &amp; his mothers account you will favorably consider his case -- </p>
<p>Truly your friend &amp;c.
<lb/>G Clay Smith</p>
