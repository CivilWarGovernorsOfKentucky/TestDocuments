<p>The petitioner Henry H. Alsman would most respectfully state to his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky James F Robinson, that at the <date when="1861-11">November Term ^1861^</date> of the Washington Circuit Court a judgment was rendered against him in favor of the Commonwealth of Ky for Fifty dollars on a charge of Carrying "Concealed Weapons" -- That when said case was called your petitioner then residing in Lincoln County Ky, was at home sick and not able to attend Court, and did not know the case was tried until the present <date when="--11">November</date> term of said Court when he was arrested by the Sheriff on a case issued on said Judgment and compelled to replevy the same -- He states that if he had been present at the trial he could have proven himself entirely innocent of said Charge. The charge was brought against him by a man who had personal animosity against him, and it was only to avenge himself that the presentment was made -- He states that he never carried a concealed deadly weapon in his life -- He asks that the fine be remitted -- </p>

<p>R S Peters Clerk

<p>The undersigned Citizens of Washington County Ky and who reside in the neighborhood where Henry H. Alsman formerly lived, state that we have known said Alsman for some time, and we have always looked upon and regarded him as a peacible quiet law abiding man, He is poor and think his case one that needs the interposition of the Executive -- </p>
