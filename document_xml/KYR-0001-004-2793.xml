   <p>Bullett County Ky <date when="1865-12-24">Decr. 24. 1865</date>
<lb/>J R Dupuy Esq
<lb/>Dr Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed please find a document Signed by the Gov. of Ky remitting a judgment on Bail bond as to Charles Foster of this County upon Your recommendation. Which has been presented to the Shff of this County and who upon advise of W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> R. Thomspon Esq refused to obey it because it erroneously sets out that the judgment was rendered in the Bullett Cir Court when in fact it was rendered in the Jefferson cir court and the process thereon was sent to the Sheriff of this (Bullett co.) where the defts reside.</p>
<p>Will you please return this to the Gov for Correction and at Same time request him to extend the remission so as to include J D Skinner &amp; James M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Nutt also... They are very poor men and equally as worthy of relief as Chas. Foster,</p>
<p>Robt. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Nutt who was the party drafted and for whom John Ayres entered as Substitute is a very poor man Struggling hard to support 5 or 6 little motherless children whom he his now unable in consequence of debts contracted for the comfort of his late wife in a protracted illness and otherwise to clothe properly this severe winter weather. By so doing you will do a humane act which will doubtless be gratefully remembered by the parties and will be very popular with the citizens in this<pb/>
<lb/>vicinity.</p>
<p>If the Governor considers Chas. Foster worthy of relief I see no reason why the other parties J D Skinner &amp; James M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Nutt <hi rend="str">will</hi> should not be relieved also -- In fact it will be no relief at all to Robt M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Nutt who is really the principal to relieve any unless all are relieved</p>
<p>Please attend to this matter and confer a great obligation on Several very worthy poor men who will not doubt Shew you their sense of gratitude Should you ever again be a candidate for Office</p>
<p>Yrs respecty
<lb/>Jno. W. Tydings.
<lb/> 
<lb/>Please send the document when corrected by mail to me at River view P. Offise Jefferson Co. Ky.</p>
<p>Jas R Page Esqr</p>
<p>Dr Sir Enclosed I send you the above which explains itself asking that you obtain correction -- the Judgment was in the <hi rend="underline">Jefferson</hi> circuit court, As to the other matters mentioned in Tydings letter I have no dobut of the truth of them -- Send Corrected remission to <hi rend="underline">me</hi>..</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Dupuy</hi></p>
