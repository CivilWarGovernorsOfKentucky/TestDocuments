<p>E. Ledford has deposited Bond in this Office with view of obtaining Coffee House License from the Trustees of the town of R Springs</p>

<p>I J. H. Wilkinson Presiding Judge of the Trigg County Court certify that at the time when Messr Ledford &amp; Baker made application for License as stated in the foregoing petition, the opinion was entertained &amp; acted ^upon^ by myself &amp; the then clerk of the County Court Mat M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Kinney that it was only necessary for the applicant to procure "Merchants License to retail" for which the tax is five dollars -- instead of State License. The same opinion was entertained by members of the bar at this place. Acting upon these views we did issue the wrong License to Ledford &amp; Baker, it was through our mistake as to the law, and not through any fault of theirs that the law was violated</p>
<p>Given under my hand this <date when="1866-09-15">15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of Sept 1866</date>
