<lb/>Hon. E. M. Stanton
<lb/>Sec<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">y</hi></hi> of War
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Accompanying this you will find a letter to yourself from Governor Magoffin of Kentucky, with other documents and papers relating to military transactions in that State of which the Governor complains as indignities to her, and violations of her laws -- By his request I submit them to you for your consideration, and beg that you will, at your earliest convenience, give to them your serious attention, and either reply directly to the Governor, or give to me an answer that I may transmit to him.</p>
<p>That you may have a full view of the Subject, and all the information that I have, I enclose, with the other papers the governor's letter to me.</p>
<p>It is true that judges may be guilty as well as others, and ought as others<pb/>
<lb/>be responsible for their conduct -- but that is an individual responsibility, and does not warrant indignity, much less violence, to the established courts of the State -- Disrespect to them, is disrespect to the State, and that Surely cannot be necessary to the proper repression of rebellious movements in Kentucky.</p>
<p>Requesting your earnest and prompt attention to the communications of the Governor, I remain,</p>
<p>very respectfully
<lb/>yr's &amp;c
<lb/>J J Crittenden</p>
<p>(a Copy)<pb/></p>
<p>Crittenden to Stanton</p>
