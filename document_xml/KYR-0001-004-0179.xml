   <p>T W Dixon and Mariah Dixon make oath and say that Mariah Dixon ^was^ recognized to testify in a prosecution against one R M Overfield in the Henderson Circuit at the <date when="--12">December term</date>. That said Mariah Dixon being in infirm health, failed to appear and her bond was taken as forfeited. That she was unable to attend at the court at which she was recognized. When summons issued on the forfeited recognizance and <hi rend="str">w</hi> was served upon her. She and her family being wholly unacquainted with legal proceedings took it to be another subpeona to appear in the same case and though she was at the court at the time the judgement was rendered did not know it was necessary and therefore made no defence to the proceedings being had upon her forfeited recognizance. She meant no disrespect or contempt to the court, and has attended as a witness in said case when ever she was able. She and her family are poor and she will be greatly embarrased if compelled to pay the amount of the Judgment against her</p>
