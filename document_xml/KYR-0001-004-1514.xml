   <p>To His Excellency,
<lb/>Gov Bramlett,</p>
<p>I, William D Young of Jessamine County, state to your excellency, that at the <date when="1865-02">February Term of the Fayette Circuit Court 1865,</date> judgment was rendered against him on a forfeited Recognizance as the surety of one John D Jeter, for $500.</p>
<p>Jeter was accused of forging my name to a Bank Check for $600.</p>
<p>He got the money on the Check and when arrested, he paid up most of the money and the balance I paid for him, and when he was sent on for further trial, I went his surety for his appearance, and he has failed to appear.</p>
<p>I raised Jeter and he was an Orphan and my Nephew.</p>
<p>He came to Lexington and fell in among <hi rend="underline">bad</hi> <hi rend="underline">men in these bad times</hi>, and his money soon <hi rend="underline">disappeared</hi> and then he at the instance of others fixed up the Check without authority from me, but not doubting that I would recognise it and his authority. This I could not <hi rend="str"><unclear/> <unclear/></hi> <hi rend="underline">truthfully</hi> do, but paid for him, the money he could not return.</p>
<p>He was indicted and then he left without my knowledge -- I do not believe he intended to commit a crime or knew the extent of his guilt.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">These are the facts</hi> -- I ask of your excellency <hi rend="underline">to relieve</hi> me <hi rend="underline">from the judgment</hi> as far as you can, and if<pb/>
<lb/>you do so, hand it to Mr George S Shanklin to be sent to John B Huston.</p>
