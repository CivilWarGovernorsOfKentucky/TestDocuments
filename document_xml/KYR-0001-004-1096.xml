<lb/>To his Excellency Governor Thomas. E. Bramlette</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Montgomery County would respectfully represent to your Excellency, that at the <date when="1864-08">present August term</date> of the Montgomery Circuit Court Charles Gilkey a citizen of this county having been previously indicted for suffering a Slave to run at large and trade for himself. was tried convicted and fined the sum of $40,00. and we would represent to your Excellency that the country is in such a condition, that negroes in this State have become to a great extent uncontrolable and do very much as they please, and we would ask your Excellency to take into consideration the peculiar and unfortunate condition of the State and the hardship which a rigorous enforcement of the Statute against suffering slaves to run at large would work in this ^case^ and to remit the fine or so much thereof as you can by law inflicted upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gilkey</p>
<p>The above are about the facts as to the condition of your Slave population in the County</p>
