   <p>Falmouth Pendleton
<lb/>County Ky <date when="1864-10-30">Oct 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1864.</date>
<lb/>To Govenor Bramlett.</p>
<p>Your petitioner John F. Hubinger would represent, that he is ^a^ Hotel keeper in the Town and County aforsaid, and at the late term of the Pendleton circuit court <date when="1864-10">(Oct term 1864)</date> judgment was rendered against him for Two hundred dollars on the finding of a jury for permitting gaming in his house. Your petitioner declares that he never did permit or consent to gaming for property or money in his house or upon his premises. He knows nothing of games, and always admonished persons to play for amusement only. He is satisfied from the testimony in the case that games were played for money or for that which represented money, but he states upon his honour, that he had no knowledge of any gaming for money. He respectfully requests your Excellency to remit so much of said judgment as is within your constitutional power to do.</p>
<p>John. F. Hubinger</p>
<p>I am personally well acquainted with John F. Hubinger. I was his attorney in the case refered to and am satisfied that the verdict of the jury was the result of the Instruction of the court arisising from the presumption which the law raised against him as proprietor of the house. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hubingher has paid me my fee and I have no further pecuniary interest in the matter. I hope the Governor will remit the judgment.</p>
<p>Saml. F. Swope<pb/></p>
<p>The subscribers citizens of Falmouth Pendleton County Kentucky, respectfully, request the Govenor to remit the judgment, of $200 rendered at the <date when="1864-10">late Oct term</date> of the Pendleton circuit Court against John F. Hubinger.</p>
