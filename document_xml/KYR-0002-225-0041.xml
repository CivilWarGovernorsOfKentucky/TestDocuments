<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Thos E. Bramlette.
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>My son Lt John V. Thompson, has been trying to raise a company for the ten thousand troops you called for, but there seems not to be much disposition to volunteer the rebels &amp; their sympathies do every thing they can to discourage it; &amp; you have taken the right course, just make them walk right in, a man that wont fight for his country ought not to live in it. I have greatly more respect for the men who are in the field with Jeff. Davis, than for those who are among us plotting the overthrow and destruction<pb/>
<lb/>of the Government that protects them &amp; all they possess, for them I have no respect, they have been handled with gloves too long. Capt Jos R, Noble, &amp; my son Lt John V. Thompson &amp; R. J. Myler ^J. Pat Ball^ Everyone trying to raise a regiment, and if they can not succeed I hope you will give them a portion in the forces you raise. Capt Noble &amp; my son have been in the service more than two years. My son was a L<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> in Co D 15 Ky infantry Pope's old Regiment, He fought at Perryville, stone River &amp; commanded his company in Gen. Thomas' night <unclear/> at Chickamauga. After the battle Col. Taylor advised him to resign on account of his health; he had had the camp Diarrheia for more than a year, but<pb/>
<lb/>but he is now well, and <unclear>anxious</unclear> to enter the lists again, and I hope you will give him a position as well as the other <hi rend="str">two</hi> ^three^ I have named,</p>
<p>Your friend

<p>Gov. Bramlett</p>
<p>We the undersigned union men of Bullitt county would respectfully recommend to your favourable consideration for promotion Cap Jos R. Noble, Lt John V. Thompson &amp; R. J. Myler ^, J. Pat Ball^ Esq. Noble &amp; Thompson have been in the military service for more than two years; Noble in the 28 Ky &amp; Thompson in the 15 Ky infantry; and both acquitted themselves well. Thompson was in every fight in which his Regiment was engaged, from Perryville to Chickamauga. Thompson has been trying to raise a company, but<pb/>
<lb/>there seems to be but little disposition to volunteer.</p>
<p>Yours Respectfully,
