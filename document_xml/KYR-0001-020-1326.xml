   <p>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Governor. State of Ky,</p>
<p>Your petitioner M. Doyle would respectfully state that at the <date when="1861-04">April</date> term of the City Court of Louisville, he was indicted and fined Twenty dollars for selling liquor without license, Your petitioner would beg to State <hi rend="str">that</hi> the circumstances under which he was fined. He is an old man and keeps a small grocery, <hi rend="str">at</hi>by which he earns a scanty living, upon one occassion he sold <hi rend="str">liquor</hi>Beer to an old customer, for which he was fined Twenty dollars, (the penalty for once selling) which he was not able to pay at that time, but expected to be able to pay it in a Short time, when a friend repleived the debt for him, the Replevin bond has now run out and he is pressed to pay the amount some $37<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> altogether, and would earnestly beg your excellency to remit $14.<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> the amt comming to the Commonwealth,</p>
<p>Your petitioner is in humble circumstances and since the present unhappy war began his business is such that he can scarce support his family by it, and he would further state that his violation of the law was entirely unintentional on his part. and he therefore prays the intervention of the Executive clemency, and Your petitioner will ever pray &amp;c</p>
<p>Michael Doyle<pb/></p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Louisville join in the petition of Michl Doyle and earnestly recommend that your excellency remit the Commonwealth portion of the fine</p>

<p>Mr. Doyle the Petitioner I know personally; he is advanced in years &amp; has a wife &amp; four Daughters and very limited means to support them, &amp; I have no doubt it would oppress him greatly to pay the fine.</p>
<p>Geo. W. Johnston.</p>
<p>In addition to the above I have known M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Doyle for the last twenty years: &amp; know that he is an industrious hard working man. and at this time it is with great deficulty that he is enabled to support his family</p>
