<lb/>Hon James F Robinson
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I left a situation I held in the Q M Dep at Warrenton Va, with Capt M D W Loomis A. Q. M. U. S. A., where I was receiving seventy dollars a month, to come home, and help drive the rebels out of my native State. When the rebels came in this neighborhood. I went and joined Col Shinkles regt 41<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Ky. as a private soldier thinking there would be a fight. I was disappointed, but I served my time out, and was discharged Saturday last. -- I was appointed Major, of Col R T Jacob's Infantry Regt last fall, but we were consolidated out. in three weeks from the time the Military Board began<pb/>
<lb/>to aid us, as a matter of course we did not fill our regiment, but it cost me over $200.</p>
<p>All I now ask if for you to give me a Commission, I will accept anything from a second lieutenancy upward, and am willing furthermore to be examined before a Military Committee, as to my qualifications for the position, I have studied Hardee's Infantry Tactics and the Army Regulations for over a year and a half, besides making a practical application of them by drilling a company xc</p>
<p>I know I could get a position by raising a company, but it is so difficult to obtain recruits, in Cincinnati they offer as high as $192 bounty for a single recruit, and the most of those willing to volunteer have been picked up, anyone who can raise a company now, at a cost to himself of less than one thousand dollars, will be doing remarkably well<pb/></p>
<p>If you will not give me a Commission however, and will authorize me to raise a company for some Infantry Regiment I will try what I can do, provided you do not limit my time or at least allow me six months.</p>
<p>Hoping you will give a favorable answer to one who is willing and eager to serve his country</p>
<p>I am very respectfully
<lb/>Your most obedient servant
<lb/>William W Mosher</p>
<p>P. S. Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi> John W Finnell and the Hon John F Fisk both know me very well and will tell you who, and what I am</p>
<p>W W M</p>
