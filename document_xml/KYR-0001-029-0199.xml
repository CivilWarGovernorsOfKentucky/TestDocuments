  <body>
   <p>His Excellency the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners, some of the Union men of Clark County, and the neighbors of Fielding M. Bush, would represent, that the said Fielding M Bush is Indicted in the Clark Circuit Court <hi rend="underline">for</hi> <hi rend="underline">treason</hi>, that he has been, as they understand with the confederate army, but has become satisfied that he was engaged in a bad cause, has returned home to Clark County the place of his residence, surrendered himself to the Military Authorities, and been discharged from custody on taking the oath of allegiance to the Government of the United States. Under these circumstances, and believing as your petitioners do, that the young men or our state, who have been deluded into the Confederate service, and have become sensible of their error, and wish to return home, and remain there as orderly and peaceable citizens, should be encouraged to do so, by the pardon of their offense, they petition your Excellency to exercise the executive clemency in favor of said Fielding M Bush who is a young man.</p>
