  <body>
   <p>To His Excellency the Governor
<lb/>of the Commonwealth of Ky</p>
<p>Your petitioners respectfully represent that Jesse Underwood now stands indicted in the Bath Circuit Court for. murder the facts are about as follows, Jesse Underwood and others were in a difficulty at the month of State in Bath C<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. (both parties having Arms (to wit pistols) in the affray as was usual in that County at that time none then being safe without arms,) and during the affray Jesse Underwood accidentally, unintentionally, &amp; verry far from his wish, shot Geo A. Trumbo from which shot Trumbo died, there being great prejudice against Underwood in Bath C<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. from facts growing out of the war, which should not be satisfied by sacrificing the means of support and probably the life of Jesse Underwood, for the unfortunate mishap for which he is indicted Jesse Underwood is a young man 22 years old of a kind and good natured disposition firm to a friend open and candid, and if restored by your Excellency<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> pardon to society and his neighborhood, will make a good citizen and probably a verry useful one. the baneful influences of the late war have had its effect, and by your kind hearted system of pardon we have derived as<pb/>
<lb/>a people the greatest advantages, and have been snatched from the destructive, condition of a people "eternally at war," and praying that your kind heart may still be open (as we have great reason to believe it is) to receive our prayer and continue so until the last cause for strife amongst our people is removed, we pray your Excellency not to let this petition be an exception. Your petitioners pray the interposition of Execute Clemency that Jesse Underwood <hi rend="str">may</hi> be pardoned and will ever pray as in duty bound.</p>
