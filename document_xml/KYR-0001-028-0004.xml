<lb/>Dear. Sir.</p>
<p>I have a Lieut'<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> commission issued to me by the Military Board and have for the last two weeks been recruiting a company. I was in the mountains but had to leave my quarters on account of the rebels being that vicinity the day I left they took Lieuts Loyd and Raborn and 8 of their men. So I thought it time for me to move. So I have left my home (Paris) and come to this place to do my best for my Government. Well when I got here I found a paroled Lieut of "Company. I. of the 18<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky Regt recruiting, when I found that this was the case, I immediately tried<pb/>
<lb/>consolidated the men we had. But He would not do so nor would he try to get his exchange. Well what I want is this that if you can get the possetion of Lieut in the 18<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> or any Regiment now on the field You shall ever be remembered by me as a warm friend. I want You to see Co<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Jno. A. Prall and ask him any questions in regard to qualification for the office and other matters</p>
<p>And by so doing
<lb/>Greatly Oblidge
