<lb/>Military Board.
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I have organised a cavalry Company in this county who have been duly sworn in &amp; have in my possession the certificates &amp;c from the County Judge. all in due conformity to law. &amp; would immediately proceed to Frankfort for arms -- but from a late card published by your board. learn that certain forms &amp;c. will be agreed upon &amp; forwarded to the Captains of the various companies or could be had on application. My Company is composed of the best &amp; most substantial men of our county -- our late representative being of the number. Can we get arms for a cavalry Company. if so I will come up immediately. our county is immediately on the border &amp; one of the most exposed &amp; has been threatened heretofore with invasion (during the Bell incitements). Being a brother of your friend Major Alexander of the U. S. Army, I particularly desire your aid in arming us at once. I have a bond duly executed with ample security &amp; if it is necessary for any other papers to be furnished by your board please send them to me at once. -- an immediate an<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> desired -- (we want good arms.)</p>
<p>Yrs Respty
