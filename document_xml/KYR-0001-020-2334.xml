   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>The Hon B Magoffin
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner would respectfully represent that pending the question of the rate of Licens at which his -- the National -- Hotel should be assessed between himself &amp; the License Inspector and the Council of the City of Louisville. He was indicted in the City Court for keeping a tipling house and fined Twenty Dollars -- He admits that he did sell liquor and do a hotel business for some days after the expiration of his License for the previous year and before it was<pb/>
<lb/>renewed for the present year -- but that it occurred because of what your petitioner conceived to be an attempt to assess him ^at a rate^ disproportional to his business and to the business of other hotels in the City -- and <hi rend="str">that</hi> one that would have been oppresive and that while attempting to protect himself against this excessive assessment before the city council -- and without any intention to violate the Law of the Land the indictment was found -- He farther states that before any trial was had in the case he did pay unto the Treasury of the City <hi rend="str">and</hi> <hi rend="str">County</hi> the sum of Two Hundred Dollars for a license and into the county<pb/>
<lb/>Treasury the amt required by the clerk -- and that there is a license issued to him and covering the period for which this indictment holds -- He farther states that supposing this renewal of his License defeated the indictment and that no trial would be had therein he failed to make any defence on the trial of the case -- and as all remedy is now removed at Law and conceiving it to be a very great hardship that he should be made to pay the fine when no violation of Law was intended -- he respectfully petitions Your Excellency to remit<pb/>
<lb/>the said fine of Twenty Dollars or so much thereof as may be in your power to do.</p>
<p>Very Respty
<lb/>F. A. Harrow
<lb/>National Hotel
<lb/>Louisville 
<lb/><date when="--09-07">7 Sept<hi rend="sup">r</hi></date></p>
<p>I am perfectly satisfied of the correctness of Maj. Harrow's representations, &amp; trust your Excellency will feel at liberty to comply with his request.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>R. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Kee</p>
<p>Under the circumstances I think the fine against Petitioner should be remitted</p>
