<p>Sir. some Twelve or more years ago my son Michelborough Daniel was indicted and fined by the circuit court of Powell county <hi rend="str">and</hi> for selling intoxicating liquors and shortly afterward in the Clarke circuit court for a similar offence, My son was then wild and headstrong, he subsequently moved to Missouri, has returned to Powell county a reformed and steady man, with a family leaning upon him, as their only support He is a poor man, and to be compelled to meet those fines would beggar his family, I am an Old man, in my seventy-eighth year, and not in a condition now to render him any pecuniary aid -- I would therefore earnestly appeal to executive clemency -- and ask you to remit said fines and recieve the lasting gratitude of him and his family and myself, Judge B. J. Peters will confer upon me the favor of presenting this petition to Your excellency</p>
<p>Relying upon your excellency's Clemency
<lb/>I have the honor to be your
