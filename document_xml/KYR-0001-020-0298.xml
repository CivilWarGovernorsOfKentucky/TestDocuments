   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>The Hon. Beriah Magoffin</p>
<p>The undersigned respectfully represent that on the <gap/> day of John Parker was arrested on a charge of passing counterfeit money, and after being tried by an examining court and committed to jail in default of giving $50.<hi rend="sup">00</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi> bail and having been there some two or three months, and having no friends and having a distressed wife and several Children dependent upon him for the necessaries of life, through Sympathy for his family E. J. Broaddus entered as his Surety for bail. Parker came forward for trial at two terms of the circuit court succeeding his arrest. He failed however at the March term to appear and his bond was forfeited and his <hi rend="underline">whereabouts</hi> are unknown</p>
<p>It is sufficient to say that his family were in extreme distress, and that M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Broaddus entered on his bail for reasons aforesaid. We believe this to be a case deserving Executive Clemency<pb/></p>
