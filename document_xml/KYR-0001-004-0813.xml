<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Governor Bramlett
<lb/>Dr Sir</p>
<p>I here enclose to you a petition for the pardon of James Phapp you will perceive the name to the petition are the prominent men of our place. Capt Bristow was the owner of the Horse taken by Phapp and J. M. Gill his Son in Law was the <hi rend="str">prominent</hi> principal witness against him I have conversed with many of our citizens upon the propriety of sending you a petition for his pardon and without an exception they are anxious for his pardon. he has 3 interesting sisters and a little Bro and his service at present would be of great value to them as they are extremely poor, for the crime committed I think he has been sufficiently punished I am in hope you may think proper under all the circumstances to grant him a pardon</p>
<p>Very Respt yr obedient Ser<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
