<p>Your Petitioner H H Hieronymus would state that in the month of <date when="1861-03">March 1861,</date> upon Chr Chinn Presiding Judge of the Mercer County Court, he <unclear>allowed</unclear> a judgement by confession to be entered against him for the sum of Twenty dollars &amp; costs for a breach of the Peace. that at the time of the entering of the Judgment, he stated that he was not guilty, but in order to save the <unclear>farcery</unclear> of the appearance of some witnesses (ladies) by attachment, the Judgement might be entered -- He says he was not &amp; had not been guilty of any breach of the peace -- The facts are simply these, a woman came to his house and commenced alarming him &amp; his family, he asked her to leave and had before desired her never to come to his<pb/>
<lb/>house and to quit annoying him &amp; his family, She refused to leave, he very gently led her out of the house, She immediately commenced throwing rocks at your petitioner and abused him very much, she then obtained a warrant for a breach of the Peace, this petitioner had no witnesses save the ladies of the family, who refused to attend &amp; give evidence or in any way to be connected with so disagreeable &amp; disgraceful business. He done no act, committed no offence but greatly endeavored to protect himself &amp; family from the abuse &amp; scurrilous language of a woman of suspicous character -- He asks the fine may be remitted -- </p>
