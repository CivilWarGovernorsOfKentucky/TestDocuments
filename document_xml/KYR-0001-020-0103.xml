   <p>His Excellency
<lb/>Beriah Magoffin -- </p>
<p>The undersigned respectfully represent that at the <date when="1860-09">Sept Term of the Madison Circuit Court for the year 1860</date>, Allen Hunter was convicted of carrying on his <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> person a concealed weapon -- The facts are briefly these -- in the year <gap/> Mr Hunter took his brother's pistol ^from his home^ to a neighbor's house for the purpose of swapping it to a third person -- The pistol was empty -- he showed it to the commonwealth's witness who says it was not loaded -- he would never have seen it if the petitioner had not pulled it out and showed it to him expressing his purpose to swap it -- We think this ^is^ a case that deserves the executive clemency -- Mr Hunter is a poor, peaceable, quiet young man &amp; the witness who testified against him did it reluctantly, believing that he had no improper motive in carrying it between the two points aforesaid -- </p>
