<p>That he did not, &amp; could not attend the trial owing to the fact ^of the troubles of the Country &amp; guerillas &amp;^ that his life had been threatened by <hi rend="underline">bad men</hi> <hi rend="underline">who</hi> <hi rend="underline">would</hi> <hi rend="underline">have</hi> <hi rend="underline">taken his</hi> <hi rend="underline">life</hi>, <hi rend="underline">or done him</hi> <hi rend="underline">great bodily</hi> <hi rend="underline">harm</hi> if he had attempted to attend the trial. If he could have attended the trial he could have made defense &amp; shown his innosence.
