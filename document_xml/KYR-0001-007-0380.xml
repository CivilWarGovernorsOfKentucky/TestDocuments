<lb/>Dr Sir</p>
<p>It was my intention during the sitting up the Legislature (but some how or other I neglected to do so) to send you the necessary fee for you to make out the papers to get me appointed Notary Public for <placeName ref="cwgk:P001005">Jefferson County</placeName>. A short term since the circuit Judge of this County appointed me examiner for this county. I now find it necessary that I be also a notary as since my appointment as examiner I have been applied to, to take depositions as Notary. I believe the <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Governor</persName> if he so thinks proper can make such appointments during the recess between the sittings of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000923">Legislature</orgName> subject however to be acted upon at the next session thereof If his Excellency will be kind enough to appoint me Notary, I should pleased he would do so. Not wishing to appear any way urgent, will state the reason I make the request is that a member of the bar informed me that he had given notice to parties in the city of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001004">Nashvilee</placeName> he would take Sunday depositions at my office on next Monday to be read as evidence in a Suit defending in one of the courts in that city, at the same time he asked me if I were a Notary as well as examiner. Learning I was not he urged me to send<pb/>
<lb/>up &amp; get myself appointed. ^as I would have to take them as Notary^ Will you, dear sir do me the favour to procure it for me &amp; if possible send it me so that I can qualify as such on Monday next which is the regular weekly sitting of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001839">County Court in this County</orgName>. Enclosed please find $2.00 -- year fee. Your early attention will oblige</p>
<p>Your Obdt Svt.
