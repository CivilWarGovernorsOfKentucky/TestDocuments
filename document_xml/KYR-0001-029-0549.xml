   <p> <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001219">Maysville</placeName><date when="1863-08-31">31<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Aug 1863</date>,
<lb/>The Honorable  of the <persName ref="cwgk:N00000233">Secretary of State</persName>,<orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">State of Ky</orgName><lb/>Dear Sir -- </p>
<p>Some four or five weeks ago I addressed to his Excellency the  of Kentucky, a Petition, numerously Signed by the most respectable citizens of Maysville, praying for the remission of a fine most unjustly imposed upon me as a Tavern Keeper (when I kept no Tavern); and which was inflicted as I contend without any just Cause. It is not only the amount of the fine which is but $20, but the <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">Governor</persName><hi rend="underline">injustice</hi> of it which renders me anxious to have it remitted -- </p>
<p>I have received no answer to the said petition, but have been informed that such matters are usually referred to the Secretary of State, and I suppose the Governor, among more important matters may have overlooked it If you will take the trouble to inform me of the fate of the petition you will place me under obligations</p>
<p>Yours Truly
