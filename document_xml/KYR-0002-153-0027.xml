<lb/>Frankfort, <date when="1861-10-05">Oct. 5, 1861.</date></p>
<p>The records in this Office show that Company E. 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> Ky Infy. was detached for Artillery service. No commissions have ever issued from this Office to any Officers of that Company nor have any muster rolls of Co<hi rend="sup">y</hi>. E. been filed in this Office. If under Company has been recruited to take the place of this Company since the Regiment was organized this Office has never been notified of the fact.</p>
<p>The following is a Copy of an endorsement made by General Finnell on a former communication from the War Department.</p>

<p>"Was not this battery originally organized as a Company of 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> Reg<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Ky Vols. It is now simply detached to act as Artillery but is paid as Infantry on the rolls of the 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> Ky Infantry, such is my understanding of the facts. I am at a loss to see the propriety of organizing it as an Ohio Battery. The Company having been mustered as Ky. Infantry.</p>
<p>The Governor declines any action in the premises. If it is the pleasure of the War Department that the Company be commissioned as Artillery the Governor will direct it to be done if however the Company organization remains as belonging to the 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> Reg<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Ky Infy. all necessary reports will be promptly filed.</p>
