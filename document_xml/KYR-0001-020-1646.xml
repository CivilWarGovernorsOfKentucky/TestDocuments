<lb/>Friend <unclear/> Van Pelt</p>
<p>I thought I would drop you a few lines informing you of a little trouble I am in and if possible would ask you to intercede for me to the Governor -- Early last spring while I was in Prestonville I got a little too much of the Mill whiskey and passing by where some men were gaming I was bantered to come in the game, I only had with me 25 cents, and not knowing the nature of the laws concerning that, and also being a stranger to this county then, as you know came from Covington -- I did play, lost the 25 cents and quit the game, and at the August term of the Carroll Co. Circuit Court was fined 20$ and cost<pb/>
<lb/>which was $11 <hi rend="sup">80</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi> making against me 31 <hi rend="sup">80</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi> sometime ago some of my friends got up a petition of some 12 names and sent the Govenor, but have received no answer to it, if it be possible that you can intercede with him and get him to remit it, I would faithfully promise never again to have such a case against me</p>
<p>Well Billy I suppose you have by this time <hi rend="str">settled</hi> &amp; you are finally settled and have commenced the laborious work that is now before you, if it is conveint I would like for you to send me a paper occasionally to see how you are getting ^along^ and what there is doing at the Capitol. I forgot to tell you before you went that I had a relation in Frankfort by the name of Lewis Crutcher who keeps I believe a good private boarding house, if you are not settled in your boarding place give him a call</p>
<p>By attending to the above immeadetly you will confer a great favor on your friend</p>
<p>Jas. S. Clark</p>
