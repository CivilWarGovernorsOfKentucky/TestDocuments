<lb/>Hon. James F. Robinson
<lb/>Governor &amp;c &amp;c
<lb/>Dear Sir -- </p>
<p>The Bearer Mrs May Miller was convicted, and fined the sum of $50 &amp; costs (for selling Liquor to a Minor) at the <date when="1862-08">August Term of the Campbell County Circuit Court 1862</date>. I represented the Com'th at her trial -- She visits you for the purpose of persuading you to remit her fine -- </p>
<p>She is a very poor widow with three infant children -- Her Husband was wounded in battle in the U, S. Service and died from the effects of the wound -- She has no property whatever save a few household effects -- which will<pb/>
<lb/>^have to^ be sold to pay the fine -- and her children will be turned out houseless and home less. Mrs. Miller manages now to make a scanty subsistence by washing -- I have inquired into her character and I feel authorized to assure your Excellency that no woman in her humble but blameless station in life sustains a better reputation -- </p>
<p>She is in every respect worthy of Executive Clemency -- Not only is this true, but, if you will allow me so to express myself her case consitutes <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> one of those extraordinary instances of conviction in respect of which it should be both the pleasure and the duty of the Executive to interpose his discriminating clemency and remit the fine<pb/></p>
<p>A, petition is already in file in the State department in her behalf in this case -- </p>
<p>Her deportment and all that I have heard of this good woman can conduce to enlist my sympathy in her behalf -- The Cov &amp;. Lex. R, R, Co -- have given her a free pass to enable her to visit your Excellency &amp; endeavor to obtain your sympathy in an effectual manner I hope this gratuitous note will not be deemed out of place by the Governor -- and I venture to conjure him to remit the fine of this destitute and harmless widow.</p>
<p>With great respect &amp;c &amp;c
