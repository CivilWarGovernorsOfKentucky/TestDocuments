   <p>His Excellency T. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>We the Undersigned Citizens of Newport ^and^ Campbell County Kentucky, would most respectfully represent That at the last term of the Campbell circuit Court held at Newport, Edmund Thornton was tried and convicted of the offense of carrying concealed deadly weapons and fined $50<hi rend="sup">00</hi>/<hi rend="sub">00</hi>. The Evidence adduced before the jury, was that threats had been made by one George Tuttle, that he would beat said Thornton and bust his damned head when he met him, that the threat was conveyed to him by one of the witnesses. That shortly after there was a gathering close to Newport that Tuttle attacked him in a violent manner, and a party present saw a Pistol in Thornton's possession. Thornton never drew the Pistol or offered to draw it though roughly used, it was also in evidence that Tuttle when under the influence of liquor was a very quarrelsome dangerous man, had been engaged in many difficulties, we think that under all the circumstances Thornton ought to have been acquitted We would therefore pray your excellency to remit the fine as we are satisfied his case is one that calls loudly for the Executive clemency. Tuttle was a strong powerful man, and Thornton a mere youth</p>

<p>I was acting Commonwealth's attorney at the late <date when="1865-02">February</date> Term of the Campbell Circuit Court, &amp; prosecutied the Case against Edmund Thornton, for Carrying Concealed weapons. According to the best of my recollection, the evidence was about as stated in the foregoing petition. I will add, that I personally know Thornton to be a young man of good character &amp; peaceable in his disposition, &amp; it is the first instance within my knowledge of his ever having been prosecuted for a violation of any law.
