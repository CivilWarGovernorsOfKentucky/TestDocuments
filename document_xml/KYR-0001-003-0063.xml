<p>In Conseqence of the loss (to W.

K, Hall to the man eminently qualified for the position Sought, -- that from his known influence and and popularity in that part of this state and Western Tennessee, he can in a reasonable<pb/>
<lb/>space of time ^raise^ a regiment of State troopes ^there^ by volunteering alone, -- that he is and will be acceptable to the Military authorities ^there^ and also to the Citizens in that part of Our State.</p>
<p>Wherefore we respectfully ask you to give him the position Sought, and power required, in the event that you deem it proper to Call out any State troops in Western Kentucky.</p>
<p>Most Respectfully,
<lb/>J D Landrum
<lb/>Thos P Hayes
<lb/>F. M. Ray.<pb/></p>
