   <p>Carlisle <date when="1862-02-03">Feby 3. 1862</date>
<lb/>To his Excellency B. Magoffin Gov. of Ky.</p>
<p>Your petition Samuel Marshall says that he became the security of F. M. Varner then a resident of this County for said Varner appearance at the <date when="--03">March</date> Term of the Nicholas Circuit Court to answer the charge of carrying concealed deadly weapons -- </p>
<p>said Varner did not appear &amp; at the <date when="1861-09">September Term 1861</date> judgment was rendered against <hi rend="str">the</hi> Your Petitioner for $100. &amp; costs and that Execution is in the hands of the Sheriff of Nicholas County who is pressing for its payment -- </p>
<p>He says Varner was not Guilty of the charge &amp; would have attended his trial but for another prosecution entered against him in Harrison County for passing Counterfeit Money -- This was the cause of his leaving. He says said Varner left the state but left no effects behind, out of which he can secure himself. He says he himself is a poor man with a family to support &amp; that the payment of this judgment is out of his power &amp; the enforcement of it by execution sale of his property would be ruinous to him -- He prays a remission of the Judgment &amp; will ever pray &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi></p>
<p>Sam<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Marshall<pb/></p>
<p>I am acquainted with the facts stated in this Petition and know they are true &amp; would Recommend the remission of the Judgment agt. Mr. Marshall.</p>
<p>Fitch Munger</p>
<p>We citizens of Nicholas County would recommend the remission of the within named Jugment -- </p>
