<p>This being all the evidence the attorney for the Comlth asked the Court to give the three following instructions viz</p>
<p><note place="left margin">Plffs Instructions</note>
<lb/>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> The Court instructs the Jury that if they believe from the evidence to the exclusion of a reasonable doubt that the Defendant Daniel Steel has been proven guilty of feloniously and forcibly and by putting <unclear>in</unclear> fear taking the guns as charged in the Indictment or aided or abetted counciled advised or sanctioned the taking by others who were present they ought to find him guilty and the punishment is Confinement in the state penitentiary for a period of not less than three nor more than ten years</p>
<p><note place="left maring">2</note>
<lb/>The Court further instructs the Jury that altho the Defendant may have been summoned to go and assist in the arrest of Reams still if after Reams had made his escape the Deft. then took the property as aforesaid or aided or assisted as aforesaid they ought to find him guilty if they believe the Same has been proven to the exclusion of a reasonable doubt<pb/></p>
<p><note place="left margin">3</note>
<lb/>That the taking of the property of another with the intention of converting the same to the takers own use and wholly depriving the owner of the same is in law a felonious taking and if the Jury believs to the exclusion of a reasonable dout the property in the indictment mentioned was so taken by the Deft or that he was present aiding or abetting encouraging or sanctioning the act they ought to find him guilty of grand Larceny and the punishment is Confinement in the State Penitentiary for a period of not less than one nor more than five years if the property has been proven worth over four dollars," To each and every one of which the Defendant objected and the Court overruled the objectives and gave each and all of said instructions to the Jury as the law of the case to which opinion of the court the Defendant then and there excepted and still excepts</p>
<p><note place="left maring">Defendants Instructions</note>
<lb/>The Defendant then asked the Court to Instruct the Jury</p>
<p>1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> That unless the Jury believe from the evidence to the exclusion of a reasonable<pb/>
<lb/>doubt that the guns taken were the property of William Reams or they were lawfully in his possession they ought to acquit the Deft.</p>
<p>2 That if the Jury believs from the evidence that the guns were government property and in the possession of said Reams fo an unlawful purpose that U S soldiers had a right to take them and turn them over to the government both of which instructions were given by the Court Defendant then asked the Court to give the following instruction</p>
<p>That if they believe from the evidence that the Deft. was summoned by an officer to go and arrest Reams under a charge of Robery that it was his duty to go and that he is not responsible for the acts of any one in the <unclear/> except his own which instruction the Court overruled and refused to give to which the Defendant excepted but the Court gave said instruction with the following modification: unless the acts of all have changed from a lawful to an unlawful purpose or that<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">6</note>
<lb/>or that the procurement of said warrant for the arrest of Reams was done to cover up an unlawful purpose and not done in good faith To which modification Defendants excepted and still excepts</p>
<p>The Defendant then asked the Court to give the following instructions Numbered 4 5 &amp; 6 7 viz</p>
<p>4 That assuming all to be true which the evidence in this case tends to prove yet if any other hypothesis except that the Defendant is guilty the Jury ought to acquit him</p>
<p>5 That if the Jury have a reasonable doubt of the defendant having been proven guilty upon the whole case they ought to acquit him</p>
<p>6 That the statements of the Defendant when proven by the Comlth are testimony as well for him as against him</p>
<p>7 That if Reams had the guns charged to have been taken for the purpose of Defending himself against a lawful arrest the officers and Those summoned by him had a right to take the guns to prevent them from being so used which instructions were given by the court<pb/></p>
<p>All the foregoing instructions being all of the instructions asked by either party or given by the court the case was submitted to the Jury who returned the following verdict (see verdict page "6" of this Transcript</p>
<p>The Defendant then moved the Court for an arrest of Judgment and also for a new trial upon written grounds filed (see page 6 &amp; 7) and in support of said motion for a new trial the Defendant produced and filed his own affidavit and the affidavits of H C Steel Emily Mitchell G B Hatfield Eliza Mitchell Leonard Knight and J Mitchell &amp; Riley Howel and the same are as follows</p>
<p><note place="left margin">Afd<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of Deft for new trial</note>
<lb/>The Defendent Daniel Steel in support of his motion for a new trial and further grounds therefor states that since his trial and conviction at the present Term of the court he has discovered that he can prove by Emily Mitchell and G B Hatfield of Whitley County that shortly after the guns should have been taken from Reams G P Steel brought to<pb/>
<lb/>G B Hatfield an army gun answering to the description of one of the guns taken from Reams and left the same at Hatfields to Keep it til he called for it that the gun is yet at Hatfields and that this defendant laid no claim to the gun or had any thing whatever to do with it as far as Known to said withness that Emily Mitchel was at Hatfields at the time G P Steel took the guns then and remained there for several months afterwards He has also discovered that he can prove by Riley Howel of Whitley County that in a verry short time after the guns were taken from Reams that William Barton took one of the guns or a gun of the same description to the house of the mother of the said Riley Howel and that the same gun has been in the neighborhood ever since and is yet there and that this defendant has had nothing to do with the gun or laid any claim to it since it was left at Mrs Howels by Barton aforesaid</p>
<p>He further states that as a means of meeting the statements of Reams<pb/>
<lb/>made on the trial to the effect that he did not believe Defendent was in good faith in wanting Reams to get his mare he can prove by Leannah Knight Ann J Mitchell H C Steel &amp; Eliza Mitchell that he was anxious and made various efforts to have the mare returning to Reams He states that he had spoken to W H Randall to defend him against this prosecution and Randall had said he would do so and affiant had relied upon the services of said Randall in his defence up to the time the case was called for trial and had made no other arrangement for councel until that term he did not know that the absence of his Council would be grounds of postponement and therefore said nothing about it His council being absent he had not been advised as to the nature of the proof it was necessary for him to produce he had therefore been unable and had failed to discover and produce the testimony aforesaid on the trial because he himself<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">7</note>
<lb/>did not Know that it would be of service to him He further says that he is not guilty of the Robery charged in the Indictment or of the Larceny for which he has been Convicted that he did not take the guns or either of them by himself or in connection with the others named in the Indictment or any one else either by force or putting the said Reams in feare nor did he feloniously steal take and carry away said guns from Reams or either of them by himself or in Company with others or did he aid or assist or render himself guilty in any way whatever but that he was all the time acting in good faith under the officer who had the warrant and who had summoned him to aid in the execution and that it is true that he tried in various ways to have Reams mare returned to him he refers to the affidavits of Emily Mitchell G B Hatfield Riley Howel Leannah Knight A J Mitchell H C Steel &amp; Eliza Mitchell and makes them part of this affid<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> and says the are true<pb/></p>
<p>He therefore prays the court to give him a new trial on which he can have the benefit of the evidence <hi rend="str">of</hi> Refered to and a full and fair hearing before the court and Jury which he has not had owing to the absence of his Council and the testimony afs<hi rend="sup">d</hi></p>

<p>This man ought never to have been convicted. If judges would instruct juries the true law of the case and expound to them the importance of a felonious or fraudulent motive as essential to constitute the crime of felony and that a <unclear>taking</unclear> under a mistaken view of right though wrong and a trespass is not a felony these great wrongs of improper convictions would be avoided.</p>
