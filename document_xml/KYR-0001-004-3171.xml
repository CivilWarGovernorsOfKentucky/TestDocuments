   <p>To
<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>The Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned Citizens of Todd County Ky respectfully represent to Your Excellency that George A. Harrel was charged with the crime of Robbery by the grand Jury of Todd County at the <gap/> term <gap/> and that on said indictment, a Judgment was rendered against him for two hundred dollars at the <date when="1865-10">Oct. term 1865</date> for <hi rend="underline">unlawfully</hi> <hi rend="underline">taking</hi> and <hi rend="underline">carrying</hi> <hi rend="underline">away</hi> <hi rend="underline">property</hi></p>
<p>The facts are as follows; In the <date when="1861">fall of 1861</date> while the rebel army had possession of this Section of the state Young Harrel was a <hi rend="underline">Lieutenant</hi> in a rebel Regiment Commanded by one Col Hornsby and then being organized at or near Allensville in this county W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> B Downey Started from Elkton towards Greenville, with a few Sacks of Sugar and when Six miles on his way, was overtaken by Young Harrel and a squad of rebel soldiers and the sugar was taken to the camp and used by the Soldiers. Harrel had special orders from his Superior officer to Seize the Sugar. Harrel's father who is a highly respectable farmer residing near this place afterwards <hi rend="underline">paid</hi> to Downey the <hi rend="underline">full</hi> <hi rend="underline">value</hi> of the Sugar G. A. Harrel is a Young man of Excellenct Moral character he's just commenced the practice of medicine D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Harrel served one year in the rebel<pb/>
<lb/>army, was discharged &amp; came home Since which his conduct has been unexceptionable</p>
<p>We think he ought not to be punished for taking the Sugar under the circumstances and hope You will interpose and remit the fine except costs &amp;c</p>

<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I have personal knowledge of the truth of nearly all the statements made in the foregoing petition. and am confident it is a case in which Executive Clemeny should be interposed I should have taken this application up myself but an execution vs Young Harrell is in the hands of the Sheriff which must be settled in a few days unless the fine is remitted</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
