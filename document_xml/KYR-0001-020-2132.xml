<lb/>To His Excellency 
<lb/>Gov Magoffin</p>
<p>My old friend &amp; Neighbour Rev Geo Rogers comes to you with a petition in favor of his son, he will present all the facts of his case which I believe ^fully^ Entitle him to Executive clemency. I am entirely satisfied that the boy has been dealt hardly &amp; unjustly with &amp; if not inconsistint with your own conclusions after a review of the case I would be glad if you would Exercise one of the powers of which a Constitutional? Legislature failed to deprive you</p>
<p>Permit me now Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> to add that you have here &amp; Everywhere in the state<pb/>
<lb/>firm &amp; devoted friends, whom you have grappled to you with hooks of steel by your conservatism, consistency, &amp; firmness, any one of whom will repay for the sloughing off of a host of time-<unclear/>, who are allways ready with the pliant hinges of the knee.</p>
<p>As Ever sincerely &amp; with great respect
<lb/>Jno. O. Harrison</p>
