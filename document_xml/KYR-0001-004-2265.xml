   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Gov. Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor</p>
<p>The undersigned would respectfully represent, that R W Sharp of Bath County, kept a grocery in the town of Bethel in said County, and that he had no license to retail spirituous liquors, but that some Federal Soldiers came to his grocery in the year <date when="1864">1864</date> &amp; demanded whisky. He told them he could not sell by the drink, and they, by threats of violence, <hi rend="underline">forced</hi> him to sell in that way. And that an enemy of his presented him to the Grand jury of the County, which indicted him and the Court fined him <hi rend="underline">Seventy</hi> <hi rend="underline">five</hi> dollars. Mr Sharp is a poor man &amp; now labors on a farm to support his little family. Therefore your petitioners would humbly pray your Excellency to remit said fine, &amp; thus relieve one who is unable to pay.</p>
