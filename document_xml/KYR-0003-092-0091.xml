<lb/>Dear George</p>
<p>You told me you had the New York Pepper Apple. perhaps you also have Smiths Cider apple. The latter is a fine eating Apple and does well as far south as the Southern part of Tennessee. I wish you to cut me some scions of the Pepper and Smiths Cider if you have it. Also of Carter a Southern Apple. I only want a few. Tie each up seperately and designate their names by a lable tied to the branch. You could also at same time send me those Pyracanthees bushes which I understand you say you did not want. Send them all to Payne's Station some warm day &amp; let them come up by a Railroad write me when you send them so I may be on the look out for them. It would be well to tie up in a bundle the Pyracanthees bushes putting some straw around the roots to prevent drying up.</p>
<p>From what Tom Bullock tells me, and from my own recollection I fear I hurt your feelings by ^my^ impolite mode of dissenting from one of your remarks. I very ^much^ regret the circumstances, and pray you to forgive it.</p>
<p>Yours Truly,
<lb/>M. C. Johnson<pb/></p>
