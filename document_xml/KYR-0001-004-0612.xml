<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramlette
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>There is at present in the hands of the Sheriff of this county two ^or three^ Executions against W. P. Adcock and in favor of the Commonwealth for $250. and one for two Hundred Dollars and I think that it is pretty hard for Mr. Adcock is a poor man and has little children to support, and further. I think the case would justify Executive Clemency. It seems that he keeps a public House and in the case for suffering gaming, he had a Ball and some of the young men, unknown to him, got to playing cards up stairs, and hence the presentment. Mr Adcock is good Moral citizen and does not allow gaming about his house</p>
<p>The cases for Selling Liquor to youths under age. I Suppose he was not aware of that; as two out of the three<pb/>
<lb/>were within a few days of being twenty one years of age and one of them the father allowed him by his order to let him have Liquor.</p>
<p>I believe if the fine is collected off of Mr Adcock it will leave him destitute of means to support his family of five little children.</p>
<p>Mr Adcock has been also very much imposed upon by the soldiers during the last year or two, and has always had his doors open to receive them and give them anything his Table Bar and stable afforded.</p>
<p>He is a quiet peacable orderly man and in the heated stated of affairs here in Trimble he has never to my knowledge uttered a disloyal Sentiment. I hope you will extend to him the clemency he asks and I have no doubt public Sentiment will hear you out in the matter</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Your Obt Sert
<lb/>Daniel S. Lane
<lb/>(Judge Trimble Co Ky)</p>
