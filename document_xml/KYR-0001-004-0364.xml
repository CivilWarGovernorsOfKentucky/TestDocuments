   <p>To His Excellency</p>
<p>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>" E Bramlette Governor of the State of Kentucky; your Petitioner would respectfully represent; that on the <gap/> day of <date when="1863">1863</date>: He became the Bail of one Frank Yocum for the appearance of said Yocum at the <date when="--10">October Term</date> of the Jefferson Circuit Court, to answer two indictments for the Larceny of two old trunks: ^and some articles of womens apparel^ said to have been stolen from Eleonora Hill; and Sarah Bell: each of whom are notorious prostitutes; and Keepers of houses of prostitution in the City of Louisville: That at the calling of the two cases: the said Defendant Yocum failed to answer, and a forfeiture of your petitioners Bonds for $400.00 ^in^ each ^case^ ^On the <date when="1863-10-19">19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of October 1863</date>^ was taken in favor of the State of Kentucky^, Your Petitioner could not produce said Yocum in Court: Because he was at that time on his way back to or in his native country of Germany where He is now as your Petitioner is informed and believes; Your Petitioner, says that He is informed and believes that from the threats and conduct of the prosecuting witnesses and their <unclear>hangers</unclear> as said Yocum became alarmed and fled the country: Your Petitioner says that Yocum has lived in<pb/></p>
<p>and about this city for several years and his occupation was that of a cultivater of flowers He attended to flowers and shubbery on the grounds that surrounded the houses of Several of our citizens: and made the impression that He was an honest hearted and simple minded man. his wife for a long time sold flowers in the market, and your petitioner had made her acquaintance, most favorably, and by her entreaties and tears: He was induced to become the Bail of her husband the said Frank Yocum: not believeing him guilty of the charges made against him by the women mentioned above; nor does your petitioner believe now that He was guilty: but by reason of his being a simple and ignorant ^man^ He was scared away when he considered the miserable characters of these who were prosecuting him and were the witnesses against him.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner says that He is not able to pay the state these heavy amounts; and He submits to your Excellency to remit to him the said forfeitures; which <hi rend="str">are</hi> is grevious and ruinous to him: and the loss of which to the public: (which your petitioner has served long and laboriously, without adequate compensation) will not, feel. -- The premises considered He prays your Excellency to interpose the Executive clemency in his behalf: and save him from this unforseen and luckless misfortune<pb/></p>
<p>except as to the clerks and Sheriffs fees and the fees to the Commonwealths attorney</p>
