   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Tho E. Bramlette, Governor.</p>
<p>Your petitioner W. D. C. Johnson would respectfully represent, that he is a citizen of M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cracken county Ky, a Union man, and has been an unyielding one all the time -- that in <date when="1863">1863</date>, one George Brown, W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Dent, W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> H. Bristow and others were engaged in playing cards, and Browns pocket book was missing, and all present concurred in the belief that Bristow took it, and they yet believe it -- all present consented to be searched, except Bristow, who refused and immediately left the crowd, was overtaken and detained and threatened, and he promised to deliver it up, if they would let him alone, but instead of doing so, fled to town &amp; caused your petition to be arrested, court being in session, and an Indictment found -- <hi rend="str">and</hi> thro his influence and the prejudice against your petitioner on account of his Union Sentiments -- and these are <hi rend="underline">truths</hi> -- Your petitioner asks a pardon of the offence charged</p>
<p>W. D. C. Johnson</p>
