   <p>His Excellency
<lb/>Gov Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E Bramlett</p>
<p>Your petitioner Joanna Bell woman of color states that in the <gap/> day of <date when="--05">the last May term</date> of the Jefferson circuit court she was arraigned on a charge of Larceny, tried convicted &amp; sentenced to a term of two years in the Ky state prison. The case is as follows-</p>
<p>Crow, a discharged negro soldier desired the girl Bell to go with him to Lexington &amp; promised her all his money if she would do so. In accordance with this proposition the girl assumed control, or rather obtained possession of the money. Crow <hi rend="str">went</hi> immediately went to the Police and had her arrested. After being arrested she gave up the money, which Crow has received- The case is one of a great deal if merit ^of^ which she should receive the full benefit &amp; not suffer on the evidence of a <hi rend="underline">single</hi> negro, uncorroberated save by the officer making the arrest &amp; who could only testify as to <hi rend="underline">information</hi> given by <hi rend="underline">Crow</hi> &amp; not to facts of the <hi rend="underline">taking</hi>- In addition to this said Joanna Bell is now <hi rend="underline">pregnant</hi>, a period of some three or four months of gestation having passed- which makes her a burden to the state for nearly the whole time of her sentence- The clemeny &amp; mercy of your Excellency is humbly asked in the above case- In accordance with the law Joanna Bell is now confined to the Frankfort Penetentiary-</p>
<p>Joanna Bell
