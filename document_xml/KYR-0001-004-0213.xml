<p>The undersigned a citizen of Christian County Ky would respectfully represent that at the last <date when="--03">March term</date> of the Christian Circuit Court he was tried under an indictment for Usurpation of the office of Jailer of said county and fined the sum of five Hundred Dollars. That under the order of the Confederate General while their army occupied Hopkinsville the Keys of the Jail for three or four days were placed in his hands this was the extent of his connection with that office, that he emprisioned no one <hi rend="str">one</hi> while thus acting. He sincerely regrets having had any thing to do with that matter. He has taken the oath of allegiance to the United States and has executed a bond with security for his good cordial and loyal deportment in future and is determined to strictly comply with its conditions. He has never been in arms against the United States &amp; never expects to be but will in future be a law abiding and loyal citizens. He has no estate out of which he can pay said fine. To deprive him of his liberty will deprive him of the means to support his family. He respectfully ask your Excellency to remit the fines.</p>
