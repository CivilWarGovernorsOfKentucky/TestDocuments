<lb/>Dear Governor</p>
<p>I have prepared the petition of Sundry citizens of this county asking you to pardon a young man of this county for stealing a pair of shoes, I have examined the names upon the petition, I know the most of them, their names Are genuine, and the most of them amongst our best citizens,</p>
<p>This is a remarkable case, the young man has brought before me, for trial, <hi rend="str">he</hi> in a few minutes after the act was committed, he very frankly admitted takeing the shoes, and said "he could not account for why he done it" he did not really need the shoes,</p>
<p>His character as given to me by men who I know to be truthfull, is that of an honest, peacable, hard working boy,</p>
<p>His family are highly reputable, though poor, and are greatly distressed.</p>
<p>I do hope you will extend to him mercy and pardon the offence before trial, as a trial would cost his Father something, and worse than that it would be so harrassing and fearfull to the minds of his parents and his two Brothers who have risked their lives in defence of their government.</p>
<p>your friend
