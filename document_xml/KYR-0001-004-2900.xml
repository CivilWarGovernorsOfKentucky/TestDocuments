<p>Mssrs E H Daniel &amp; Bro have pending against them in the Caldwell Circuit Court four Indictments -- No 1. Keeping a Gaming House -- No 2 setting up a "Jenny Lind" Table upon which money or other valuable thing was <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>won or lost and Two Indictments for permitting minors to play upon said Table. -- I have been at the Caldwell Court for two weeks, my information is, and I obtained it from Citizens and from hearing several cases for the same offences tried -- That it was not the purpose of any of these parties to set up gaming Tables or to induce Gaming and that really no money was won and lost upon the Tables -- that young men and the Officers and Soldiers would go into the saloon kept by these Gentlemen and play, and all that was ever bet upon their Table was Liquors and Cigars -- They are deserving young Men and poor, and if tried and convicted the fines will ruin them= And as you have pardoned parties charged with the same offences -- I have at their instance addressed you and hope under the Circumstances and<pb/>
<lb/>and the unsettled condition in which our country has been you will relieve these parties.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be
