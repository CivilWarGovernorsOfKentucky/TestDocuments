<lb/><date when="1862-01-08">8 January 1862</date>
<lb/>My dear Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi>.</p>
<p>An afflicted father begs a line from me to you on behalf of an erring &amp; it may be a <hi rend="underline">guilty son</hi> -- !</p>
<p>I know nothing of the facts, save that a young boy of respectable connections in his 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year has been convicted of appropriating the proceeds of a church, with which he was entrusted, to his own account -- </p>
<p>Will an incarceration<pb/>
<lb/>in the penetentiary for eighteen months, or for a day benefit this youthful offender? Will it not rather harden him, &amp; take away the last hope of reformation? If this be his <hi rend="underline">first crime</hi>, if bad associations &amp; heedless dissipation has hurried him to the brink of <unclear>precapice</unclear>, &amp; brought him to see the felons cell as his abode for eighteen months, may not a pardon, before he<pb/>
<lb/>enters it <unclear/> him?</p>
<p>I submit these <unclear/> to your your consideration, in the view of public policy, not less than a humane regard for the feeling's of this unfortunate boy, whose guilt I presume is beyond question</p>
<p>If his youth &amp; respectable connections afford a grand for your interposition, I hope you will pardon him -- </p>
<p>Very truly your &amp;c
<lb/>J W Stevenson</p>
