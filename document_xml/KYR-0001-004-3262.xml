   <p>To His Exitency Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E. Bramlette
<lb/>Govenor of the Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> of Ky.
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>There is a petition in circulation which will no doubt accompany this note for the pardon of Isaish &amp; Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Farris who was sent to the state prison from the Jefferson Circuit Court -- for four years -- for the stealing <hi rend="str">the</hi> ^a^ horse of Mine and one from M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> Jame Miller- the horses were both recoverd and now sir in view of the tender age of the boys - and knowing the surounding influences under which they labored of pressing Horses by Soldier and Citizen allmost indiscriminly and having been confind in Jail and state prison for about two years. I as the prosecutor feel and think they have been punished sufficiently and am therefore willing they should released and discharged from prison</p>
<p>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. R. Phelps</p>
