<lb/>To his excellency Beriah MaGoffin Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky 
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>You have a Petition presented you petitioning your excellency to remit a fine of twenty Dollars imposed by the carter circuit court against Jonathan Rogers for being in adultery you have the facts set forth in the Petition, I will merely say that the names to that Petition are worthy citizens and acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case and that your clemency will be properly exercised to grant the prayer therein set forth; and from my personal knowledge of you and your character, I hope you will not consider it flattery in me when I say, I know of no one that possesses that noble quality of compassion on the humble than he who now fills the Gubernatorial ^chair^ of the Commonwealth of Kentucky </p>
<p>Yours Truly 
<lb/>J. M. Summers. </p>
<p>P. S. I was not his atto in the cause</p>
