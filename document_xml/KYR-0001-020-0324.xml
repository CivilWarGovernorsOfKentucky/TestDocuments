<lb/>Hon Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Gov.</p>
<p>At the request of Mr. South, I write to you to give a statement of the Evidence in the case of the Comlth against John Gambrill;</p>
<p>Gambrill was indicted in the Perry Circuit court for passing counterfeit Money -- </p>
<p>The proof showed that a Mr. Gullit called on John Gambrill to loan Him money Gambrill Had none according to His statement, a man by the name of Harman Bush was present -- Gambrill called<pb/>
<lb/>on Bush to Know if He had any money, who took out of His purse a $20 -- on some Louisiana Bank and $10 -- Kentucky Bank note, put them on the counter and Gullit took the money it was not in the Hands of Gambril, Gullit was to pay Gambrill,,</p>
<p>There was proof to show that Gambrill Had previously been seen with a Louisiana Bank Bill similar to the one that was passed -- And some Testimony I think by one witness who could not read. That He Had seen Gambrill with the $10 Bill. This is as near as I reckollect the proof<pb/>
<lb/>in the case -- The Jury I have no doubt came to the conclusion that there was some understanding between all of the parties Though Gullit who was the principle witness swore that He did not Know the money was counterfeit all the time He took it.</p>
<p>Since the conviction of Gambril Gullit Has been Indicted for passing or Having in his possession with Intent to pass, the same money.</p>
<p>I wrote to you some months ago the full historie of the case, to which I would call your attention</p>
<p>Gambrills wife &amp; children are very respectable -- a number of good citizens<pb/>
<lb/>would like to see Him parttoneded</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Your obt Servt
<lb/>John Dishman</p>
