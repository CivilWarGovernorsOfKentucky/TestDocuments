   <p>Lexington <date when="1863-05-13">May 13. 1863</date>
<lb/>Gov James F Robinson
<lb/>Frankfort
<lb/>Ky
<lb/>Dr Sir</p>
<p>Inclosed find a petition of John M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Caw for the remission of a fine inflicted upon him in this Lexington City Court.</p>
<p>The facts are fully set out in the affidavits of M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Couathy Yates &amp; Dawden, who were supoened as witnesses for him but who were not examined as neither Hunt nor Beck atten^ded^ trial -- Both forgot it, too late to obtain a new trial he applied to me as his attorney and I have taken the testimony in the case</p>
<p>Appended to his petition you will observe the statement of the City Judge to the effect that the verdict was not warranted by the evidence and he would on application timely made have granted a new trial</p>
<p>You are a lawyer of mature experience and I submit the whole matter to your sense of justice and fairness</p>
<p>It is not one of the accustomed petitions in which the confidence of the Executive is so often abused and imposed upon</p>
<p>May I hope for the remission<pb/>
<lb/>of the fine in a few day<hi rend="sup">s</hi> -- </p>
<p>Should you desire any other step taken can you inform me by mail</p>
<p>Your friend
<lb/>C. D. Carr</p>
<p>Hon James F Robinson
<lb/>Frankfort
<lb/>Ky</p>
