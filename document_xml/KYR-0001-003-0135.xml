<lb/>411 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE,
<lb/>Washington, D. C., <date when="1865-10-13">Oct 13 1865</date>.
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>On the <date when="--09-22">22 Sept</date> I addressed a communication to the Secretary of the Treasury thro' the Office of the Third Auditor asking for a further advance on the War claim of the State of Ky filed prior to <date when="1863-05-13">May 13 1863</date>.</p>
<p>By direction of the Q. M. Genl of Ky I Stated the account thus:</p>
<p><table rend="rules">
<row>
	<cell>Claims filed prior to <date when="1863-05-13">May 13/63</date></cell>
	<cell/>
	<cell>$2.246.400.76</cell>
</row>
<row>
	<cell>Amt advanced in cash</cell>
	<cell>$436.000.00</cell>
	<cell/>
</row>
<row>
	<cell>Direct Tax retained</cell>
	<cell><hi rend="underline">$615.000.00</hi></cell>
	<cell><hi rend="underline">1.051.000.00</hi></cell>
</row>
<row>
	<cell>Balance claimed by State of Ky</cell>
	<cell/>
	<cell>$1.195.000.76</cell>
</row>
</table></p>
<p>This Statement assumes that the direct tax forms a part of the Sum advanced viz $1.051.000.<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> but upon investigation I find that there has been $1.051.000.00 advanced in cash as follows.</p>
<p><table rend="rules">
<row>
	<cell><date when="1862-05-26">May 26. 1862</date></cell>
	<cell>$315.000.00</cell>
</row>
<row>
	<cell><date when="1862-06-27">June 27 "</date></cell>
	<cell>436.000.00</cell>
</row>
<row>
	<cell><date when="1863-06-03">June 3 1863</date></cell>
	<cell>100.000.00</cell>
</row>
<row>
	<cell><date when="1864-03-08">March 8. 1864</date></cell>
	<cell><hi rend="underline">200.000.00</hi></cell>
</row>
<row>
	<cell>Total</cell>
	<cell>$1051.000.00</cell>
</row>
</table></p>
<p>This sum does not include the direct tax which<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header"><figure type="seal"><ab>UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL</ab></figure>
<lb/>Office Kentucky State Agency,
<lb/>411 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE,
<lb/>Washinton, D. C.,</note>
<lb/>is $606.641.04 instead of $615.000.00 as assumed in my letter above referred to.</p>
<p>I made my Statement upon information derived from yourself and Genl Suddarth. The mistake is a large one. The whole amt advanced to the State including the direct tax is $1.657.641.04 which deducted from the Amt claimed by the State viz $2.246.400.73 leaves a balance of only $588.759.69. The balance is too small to insure a hope that any further advance will be made.</p>
<p>You will please examine the auditors books &amp; report whether his accounts agree with this. The dates of his entries may differ from the dates here given as there is sometimes quite a delay between the date of a requisition for funds and the date of its transmission to the party asking for it. The first two sums viz $315000 and $436.000 were received by Joshua F. Speed as agent for the State. The Sum of $100.000 was transmitted to Gov Robinson in <date when="1863-08">Aug 1863</date> and the sum of $200.000 transmitted to you in <date when="1864-03">March 1864</date></p>
<p>I respectfully request that you inform me on this subject. The State account will be<pb/>
