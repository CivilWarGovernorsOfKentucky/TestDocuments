<p><note place="left margin">Instructions</note>
<lb/>1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> If the Jury find from the evidence that the Deft in this county, before the Indictment was found &amp; as charged therein, with the felonious intention of appropriating the same to his own use, &amp; against the knowledge<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">9</note>
<lb/>&amp; consent of Foy stole took &amp; carried away the horse of S<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> Foy, then they will find Deft Guilty, &amp; fix his punishment by Confinement in the Penitentiary for not less than <hi rend="underline">four</hi> nor more than <hi rend="underline">eight</hi> years -- </p>
<p>2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> If from all the Evidence in the case, the Jury Entertain a reasonable doubt <hi rend="str">of the Guilt</hi> as to whether the facts, constituting the offense charged have been proven, then they will find the Deft not Guilty,</p>
<p>3<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rd</hi></hi> The Law implies Guilt from the possession of stolen goods unexplained, and the burthen of disproving it, is on the Deft,</p>
<p>after argument the Jury retired &amp; returned with the following verdict (Copied on page 3)</p>
<p>and afterwards towit on the <date when="1861-01-14">14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of January 1861</date> The following entry and order was made in this cause viz,</p>

<p>The following are the Grounds for a new trial filed herein,</p>
<p>The Deft asks the court to grant him a new trial because</p>
<p><note place="left margin">Grounds for new trial</note>
<lb/>1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> The verdict of the Jury was not warranted by the Evidence, in the case, for there was no proof of sufficiently identifyinig the Deft as the person having the horse of Foy in his possession, nor was there any pro<hi rend="str">f</hi>of that the Deft, did feloniously take said Horse, from the Stable of Foy for the purpose of converting the same to his own use<pb/></p>
<p><note place="header">12</note>
<lb/>2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> The verdict of the Jury was contrary to the Law Given in this case, because the 2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> instruction of the court was as follows "If from all the Evidence in the case the Jury entertain a reasonable doubt as to whether the facts constituting the offense charged, have been proven, then they will find the Deft not Guilty," The first instruction was that if the Jury find from the Evidence that the Deft with the felonious intention of appropriating, to his own use, stole took and carried away the horse of said Foy, then they will find said Deft Guilty,</p>
<p>The Deft believes there was no evidence in this case to justify the verdict, and therefore they have adjudged him Guilty, contrary to Law or Evidence</p>
<p>3<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rd</hi></hi> Because of the misconduct of the Jury in arriving at their verdict,</p>
<p>And afterwards towit on the said <date when="1861-01-14">14<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of January 1861,</date> The following entries and orders were made in this cause as follows viz -- <pb/>

<p>The instructions in this case were misleading and wrong there was no evidence upon which to base the the 3<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rd</hi></hi>. The finding was not sustained by the evidence and the Indictment is bad. I have no doubt but this case would have been reversed by the court of <hi rend="str">a</hi>Appeals and rightfully reversed. The punishment already completed has been at least sufficient for the evidence. And as he is the only help left for a widowed mother, where other sons have fallen in defence of our country a pardon is ordered</p>
