<lb/>His Excellency B Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Gov.</p>
<p>Sometime ago I forwarded through Hon. G. P. Webster a Petition from Mr. John Dilling asking your Excellency to remit a fine, assessed against him which you were Kind Enough to respite for 12 Months. upon a former application. The time for which you granted a respite being about to expire Mr Dilling forwarded his application by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Webster as aforesaid who upon his return here stated that he called your attention to the subject and presented the petition of Dilling (which was signed by some of our prominent Citizens) and that your Excellency promised to look into the papers on file. The officers are now pressing M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dilling for the payment of the fine. and he has requested one to state his case to your Excellency. I can say for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Dilling that he has resided here for many years during which time he has always conducted himself as an upright honest man. and that this was the first time he was ever brought before any court in the Commonwealth charged wtih an offense which less convicted of one I think him well deserving of the executive clemency. I trust you may take the same view of his case. </p>
<p>I am your Excellency's obd. Sevt.
<lb/>Geo R Fearons.<pb/></p>
<p>Remitted
<lb/>B. M</p>
