   <p>To His Excellency Thomas E. Bramlett: governor of Kentucky, </p>
<p>Your Petitioners would respectfully represent that at the present Term of the Morgan Circuit David Combs, was tried and convicted to the Penitentiary for four years, ^for horse stealing^ they would represent that said Combs is quite a youth not more than 17 years at the time he is charged with taking the Horse, that during the Rebelion he joined the army, and was sworn in as a soldier and shortly after he joined the army his Father was brutally murdered in his own house by a gang of merauders, <hi rend="str">who</hi> leaving a widow with <hi rend="str">eleven</hi> ^twelve^ children some of them very young &amp; helpless the said <gap/> being the oldest his Mother by persuation and entreaty had her son the <unclear/> who now seeks pardon <unclear/> from the army &amp; he returned to his Home, to work for the support of his widdowed Mother &amp; helpless children.</p>
<p>The proof on the trial <unclear/> to show, that a <hi rend="underline">thieving gang</hi> came along, and David Combs was in their compnay. about the time the horse was stolen, and further <unclear/> to show that owner of the horse, after he reclaimed him, by threats of violence, and death induced him to confess that he had taken the horse and upon this confession ^and having been seen near where the horse was hitched out^ the Jury found him guilty of the crime. We firmly believe that this is a case that requires the interpositiion of executive clemency, and that the unfortunate boy should be pardoned.</p>
