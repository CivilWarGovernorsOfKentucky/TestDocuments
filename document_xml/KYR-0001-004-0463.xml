   <p>His Excellency
<lb/>T. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Gov. of Kentucky,
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>In the Powel Circuit Court there are four Forfeitures against W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Bowen and W<hi rend="sup">m</hi>" Stone as the Securities for one Robt. Milbourne - one Newton Bowen - one Hezekiah Bowen and one W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Bowen</p>
<p>Said Milbourne &amp; Bowens were indicted for killing one Hall - The three Defts Bowen have always been present at Court except once and then were prevented and frightened from so doing by threats of the relatives of the decd. Hall. At the last Court they were present, and are now in Powel County, being out on ^new^ Bail. Said Milbourne is supposed to be within the rebel lines, and perhaps not living. The Security W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Bowen - is one of the best citizens of Powel County. I therefore ask your Excellency to remit said forefeitures. The style of the cases are Com<hi rend="sup">th</hi> vs W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Bowen &amp; W. Stone on forfeited Recognizance of Robt Milbourne. - Same vs Same on forfeited Recog. of Newton Bowen, also on that of Hezekiah Bowen. also on that of W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Bowen ^making four cases^ Each forefeiture is in the sum of $500. Said forfeiture is in the sum of $500. Said forfeitures were ordered at the <date when="1862-11">Nov. Term 1862</date> of said Court.</p>
<p>Wm Henry Holt<figure type="hr"/></p>
<p>The above is about a fair statements of facts in the case, &amp; my per cent being secure, I freely consent to the remission asked above, as I think it would be nothing but justice &amp; right under the peculiar circumstances of the case</p>

<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Gov. of Ky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>Your excellency will remember my being at Frankfort, and endeavoring to get said forfeitures remitted before Judgment and your objecting to it as euchering the Comths Atty. I have now compr^om^ised with him by paying a good proportion of his per cent. In fact nearly all and send evidence to you for a remission according to your direction. </p>
<p>I would send the petition I then had with me and the Afft. - But as you no doubt remember them I suppose they are not requisite. The cases are as follows to wit 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>" Com<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Ky vs W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Bowen &amp; W. Stone on forfeited Recognizance of Hezekiah Bowen.</p>

<lb/>Each are in the sum of 500.</p>
<p>Please send them to my address as soon as convenient as the Powel Ct. Court comes soon, if your Excellency sees fit.</p>
<p>If not too much of a favor I would be very thankful for two or three copies of Your last message at the same time you send the Remissions, as I failed to get any when down.</p>
