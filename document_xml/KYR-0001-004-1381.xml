<lb/>His Excellency Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>We have heard the representations of Mess Hill &amp; Knott Attys for M Foley and endorse them as Substantially correct we having heard the evidence given on the trial, (and F B <unclear>Merrimec</unclear> having conversed with one of the Dickens before he died) There is no doubt in our minds that Foley ^acted^ under the belief that the Dickens <hi rend="underline">were</hi> <hi rend="underline">Gurillas</hi> and the evidence Showed that he had good cause to Suppose them to be Gurillas, We have heard no one doubt the honesty of his intentions, Foley is a discharged Soldier and we have never heard anything derogatory to his moral character, bearing the character of an honest hardworking peaceable Irishman<pb/>
<lb/>and had these men proved to be Gurillas he would have been applauded by all good citizens &amp; we repeat we have no doubt <hi rend="str">but</hi> that he acted in good faith under the impression that they were Gurillas &amp; that he had good reasons for so believing. we therefore most cheerfully recommend him to executive clemency</p>
<p>we are most respectfully
<lb/>your Obt Servts
