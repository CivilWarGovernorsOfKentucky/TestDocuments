<lb/>Gov. B. Magoffin
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>The Lago case having been adjudicated by the Supreme Court of the United States at Washington, I address this to your honor to request a reasonable compensation to me for services rendered in that case. I made two trips to Columbus as your agent with requisitions, and refused by the Governor of Ohio, as you are aware, I have faithfully watched the movement of Lago, so that his arrest could be made when lawful to do so, and am still in possession of the knowledge of his whereabouts, and would be glad to arrest him if permitted. My time and services are worth to me 100$ and I throw myself upon the liberality and justice of your State.</p>
<p>Very respectfully
<lb/>Your obt Serv't
<lb/>William L Manson
<lb/>Dept U.S. Marshal</p>
