<lb/>To His Excellency Jas F Robinson
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>About two years Since, two Youths, both natives of this City, are by the name of <gap/> Hugh and <hi rend="str">Charlie Stevens</hi>the other by the name of Charlie Stevens were charge with the Larceny of said <unclear/> &amp;c: They were tried and convicted and sentenced to confinement in the Penitentiary of this state for a period of Four Years Three years of which time has now about expired; from the Evidence they both participated in the theft,, but it was clear that young Hugh was bold and resolute and that young Stevens, was timid and yielding, and there could be but little doubt, that Hugh was the master spirit in the affair: Mr Stevens the father of Charles Stevens, is an old Citizen, and thought at the time his boy was connected with it; and seemed to think that the law was justly executed, except that the punishment was too severe in the length of time: He now says he believes his boy is truly penitent about the matter, and asks the interposition of Executive clemency in his behalf The undersigned would most respectfully<pb/>
<lb/>join M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Stevens in his prayer</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>E S Craig.

<p>Gov. Robinson,</p>
<p>I have known Mr Jas Stephens, the father of Charles Stephens, for many years. He is an excellent citizen, and a devoted patriot, a fighting patriot. His son, if released, will go at once into the military service of the United States. I hope you will think that his is a case in which Executive clemency can be properly exercised. Young Stephens is but a boy.</p>
<p>Truly Yours,
<lb/>Geo. D. Prentice.</p>
<p>I concur with the above &amp; would be glad to see the young man released &amp; enter the service of the U S Government -- <date when="1863-07-03">July 3 of 63</date> if consistent -- Yours Truly } T T Shren</p>
<p>I Know the Father of Charles Stevens He is an honest hard working man and has been much <unclear/> by his Son who was arrested &amp; <unclear/> prisons &amp; proved repentent I ask on account of his youth &amp; his father you will pardon him</p>
<p>James Guthrie<pb/></p>
<p>Gov. Robinson</p>
<p>Under all the circumstances I feel constrained to ask your Excellency to pardon young Stephens.</p>
<p>Very respetly &amp;,
