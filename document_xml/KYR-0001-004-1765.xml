<p>Your Petitioner States that he is poor &amp; hard run and that he has a helpless family, that his wife has been Confined to her room for nearly twelve months and that he is wholly unable to pay said fine without selling his little property Your Petitioner would again state to your Excellency that he had no intention to violate the law, and that he thought he had the right to retail Spirits under the license obtained and that it is his first Offence and that it Shall be his last</p>
<p>Your Petitioner would further State that he would not appeal to your Excellency but that he is poor and his family are in great need &amp; that he is entirely unable to pay Said fine without selling his property which is absolutely needed for the comfort of his family wherefore your Petitioner would request your Excellency to remit Said fine and as in duty bound he will ever pray &amp;c</p>
