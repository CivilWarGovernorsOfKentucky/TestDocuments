<p>Your petitioner would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1865-04">April Term 1865</date> of the Wayne Circuit Court, he was indicted by the Grand Jury of Wayne County for the offense of keeping a tippling house for three months at Mill Springs. Wayne County, Kentucky, and that at the <date when="1865-10">October Term 1865</date> of Said Court he confessed Judgment for $60 -- <hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> upon trial under said indictment with the consent and by agreement with the Attorney for the Commonwealth -- </p>
<p>He further States that he did not keep a tippling house for three months, and that during the time he sold said liquors, he was regularly licensed to do so under the Internal Revenue laws of the United States, which he supposed would be sufficient authority as he had no means of procuring the license required by the laws of the State of Kentucky from the fact, that at that time there was no judge of the Wayne County Court or any one else in said County authorized t<hi rend="str">he</hi>o grant him said license He furthermore States that he was bound to sell said liquors at the time, and in the manner he did or suffer considerable pecuniary l<hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>oss Wherefore he asks as a favor that said fine be remitted</p>
<p>Respectfly J. S. Frisbie<pb/></p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Wayne County respectfully bear witness to the truth of the foregoing Statements, heartily endorse the petitioner as a man who will do all in his power to comply with the laws of his State and Country, and cordially join in his prayer for the remission of Said fine -- </p>
