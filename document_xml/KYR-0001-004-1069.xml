   <p>To His Excellency Gov: Bramlette</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Louisville would respectfully ask you to pardon David Schroeder who is now confined in the Penitentiary of this State; <hi rend="str">and who was</hi> ^having been^ convicted of cutting Andrew Doran. at the late term of the Jefferson Circuit Court. we are law abiding citizens of Louisville and we desire to see the laws upheld and crime punished. We would be very far from interposing our influence, (if ^we^ were possessed of any,) to shield the guilty from punishment; or to relieve them, when the penalty of the law had overtaken them. As a general thing we are averse to asking the interposition of the Executive when a man has been charged with crime and punished by due courts of law.</p>
<p>But the present case forms an exception to the general rule by which we are governed. David Shroder long followed the business of a stone cutter and has lived in Louisville for upwards of twelve years. He is a married man and has a family of six children, most of whom are very young, and entirely helpless. His wife is a most excellent woman, but she is unable to support her family in the absence of her husband He was her stay and support. They have our heartfelt sympathy. We are aware that<pb/>
<lb/>your official duty would not authorize you to afford him relief upon those grounds alone; but we feel assured that an enlightened exertion of your high perogative of pardon to a condemned criminal does not <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> forbid the indulgence of the sublime attribute of mercy.</p>
<p>Schroder is a man of hasty temper, but he ^is^ liberal to the poor and self sacrificing as a friend. In the matter of cutting Andrew Doran, we are convinced if he had not been under the influence of intoxication he would never have committed the deed. Doran is now living and is attending to his business.</p>
<p>The punishment which Shroeder has already suffered we feel pursuaded will make him a better man. It will teach him doubtless in time to come, that obedience to law is the highest duty of the citizen. We respectfully urge you to pardon him and restore him to his helpless and suffering family.</p>
