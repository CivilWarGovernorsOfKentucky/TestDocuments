   <p>The undersigned citizens of Green County, would respectfully represent to your excellency, that at the present term of the Green Circuit Court Jesse P. Close was tried and convicted on a charge of shooting at and wounding one M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> Ann Noe and her daughter Nancy Ann Noe with a shot Gun, and was sentenced to pay a fine of four hundred dollars, and imprisonment in the county Jail for four months -- Your petitioners further state, that they are informed that a petition is in circulation, and intended to be presented to your excellency for a releasement of the imprisonment, and remission of the fine aforesaid, of the said Close -- we believe it would be doing injustice to the cause of justice to do either, and therefore insist that your excellency do not entertain the petition alluded to, in the event that it should be presented, we do not believe that it is a case entitled to executive clemency, but on the contrary opinion of many, his punishment is less severe, than a crime so enormous as the one of which he was convicted, should have received, we therefore pray your excellency to reject the prayer of the petition which may be presented to you in behalf of said Close, and as in duty bound we will ever pray &amp;C -- </p>
