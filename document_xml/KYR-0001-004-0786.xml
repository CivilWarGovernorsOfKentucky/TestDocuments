<lb/>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. T. E. Bramlett
<lb/>Frankfort Ky.
<lb/>Dear Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</p>
<p>My friends Major Wall &amp; W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Swiney Esq<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. will visit your Excellency for the purpose of appealing to your clemency in behalf of Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. B. Lawton who has been convicted of robbery in the M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Lean Circuit Court and sentenced to three years confinement in the penatentiary of the state. I know nothing of the circumstances of the case aside from the statements of these gentlemen. But I have known the young man &amp; his father and mother for years- They were honest religious people. The young man has a very<pb/>
<lb/>Ordinary mind. He was regarded by all who Knew him prior to the rebellion as an innocent unoffending industrious boy. Just such a youth as would be likely to be gulled and led off by the great tide of rebellion that swept over that section of the state. From my knowledge of him. and the statements of the gentlemen. I am Satisfied that it is one of those cases that demand the interposition of Executive Clemency- And I therefore respectfully urge Your Excellency to interpose and release him</p>
<p>I am Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<lb/>Very Truly Yours
<lb/>J M Shackelford</p>
