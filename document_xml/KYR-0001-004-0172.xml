<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bramlette
<lb/>&amp;c &amp;c</p>
<p>Your Excellency will see the certificate of the Clerk of the Jefferson Circuit Court in the case of the Com. vs. Chas Smith and also the petition enclosed.</p>
<p>You will observe that the names of only eight jurors are attached. They were unanimous in requesting me to petition but before I could get up the petition the Court adjourned and I have resolved not wait<pb/>
<lb/>until Monday, but to send it off with the eight signatures and the explanation why only eight appear I was appointed by the Coms to defend for him and found him a very deserving young man. I hope your Excellency will consider his case, which has been presented to you in a hurry and with more informality than it might have been at your earliest convenience and remit his pardon to me if at all possible before he leaves the city<pb/>
<lb/>for Frankfort</p>
<p>I have the honor to be your Excellency's humble Obdt Servt</p>
<p>Geo. Kilpatrick
