   <p>Louisville Ky
<lb/><date when="1865-05-18">May 18. 1865</date>
<lb/>Gov Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Gov</p>
<p>Allow me to introduce to you M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Charles Selvage who comes to you upon a painful mission. She visits you to beseech the pardon of a brother, who has but just returned to the bosom of a now sorely afflicted family, after an absence of more than three years in patriotic service of his country. I pray you, Governor, grant her request and give to Edward Mitchell your full pardon.</p>
<p>This young man was among the first in this State to answer to the call of the Country and enlisted a private in Company B of the "Louisville Legion", served his term faithfully and when mustered out at once returned to peaceful pursuits. He was always a good steady and true soldier, ever ready to respond to the call of duty and among the bravest in<pb/>
<lb/>battle. He was full of life and ever <hi rend="str">sober</hi> the laughter provoking messmate. A temperate youth he was ever a favorite of his officers This is the character of this young soldier as detailed to me by Capt John. M. Huston of the reg<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. than whom there is no more truthful man. </p>
<p>Young Mitchell was mustered out with his regt a few months ago and until Election day in <date when="1865-04">April last</date> had never a difficulty. On that day he was pursued withersoever he went, -- to poll after poll as well as other places --, was abused and threatened and at last was <hi rend="underline">compelled</hi> to slay his pursuer, a man named Watson, <hi rend="underline">after having been assaulted</hi>. I have had some talk with you upon this subject: these returned soldiers must be allowed to protect themselves.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> <hi rend="str">Mitchell</hi> Selvage will present you with two petitions, one signed by part of the jurors who tried Mitchell; and one, signed by citizens and a large majority of our Police who I am led to beleive would not ask that<pb/>
<lb/>a vicious man should be turned loose upon the community. But be this as it may, Mitchell is a youth of good character not in the habit of being engaged in broils and difficulties, and did not act in this case until after being pursued, abused and assaulted by a man far his superior in physical power.</p>
<p>I reiterate my earnest hope that you will permit his sister to return to the city with your pardon</p>
<p>I am very truly
<lb/>Your Friend<hi rend="underline">
<lb/>Jo. G. Wilson</hi></p>
