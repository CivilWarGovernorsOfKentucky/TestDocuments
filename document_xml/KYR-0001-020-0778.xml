   <p>Christian <date when="1861-03-04">4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of March 1861</date>,
<lb/>To his Ex. Gov. Magoffin-
<lb/>Dr Sir-</p>
<p>Jonathan Greer- has been convicted of Manslaughter by a Jury of Christian. He is a good Fine man, as I verily believe -- the circumstances of the case will be explained to you by Mr. Berry. They will I trust be sufficient for you. to exercise your executive clemency I am satisfied that his pardon will ^be^ greeted with great joy- by the very best people in his neighborhood &amp; in the county -- </p>
<p>I remain very faithfully your dutiful subject-</p>
<p>J. D. Morris</p>
<p>I concur fully in all Co<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Morris has said</p>
<p>Jno. J. Thomas</p>
<p>I also concur fully in all Col Morris has Said</p>
<p>A.. C.. Jones<pb/></p>
<p>I have Examined the Contents endorsed by the distinguished Citizens whose names appear within <hi rend="str">and</hi> and fully concur with them- And will also add that a large number, if not a large majority of our Citizens believe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Grear Justifiable in the lamentable deed which has resulted in his conviction_ The undersigned has been requainted with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Grear for a quarter of a century and all that time he has had the reputation of a sober, orderly Citizen_ He is an old man; and should executive Clemency be exercised in his favor, the act would be kindly appreciated by many Citizens of one County ^&amp;^ by a large circle of acquaintances &amp; friends, but the Joy &amp; delight the act would bring to a distressed wife &amp; children it were unecessary to speak of- Respectfully &amp; obediently yours-</p>
