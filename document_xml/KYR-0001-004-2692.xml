   <p>To His Excellency, Tho E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1863-11">Novr Term 1863</date> of the owen Circuit Court. a Judgement was rendered in Said Court in favor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky against John B M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Hatton John H Threlkeld Thomas A Moss &amp; W W Dawson for the Sum of $1000<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> with costs on a forfeited Bail Bond. Executed by Said M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Hatton, Threlkeld, Moss &amp; Dawson, as Sureties for the appearance of Thomas P Herndon at the <date when="1861-11">November Term <hi rend="str">of</hi> 1861</date> of Said Court, to Answer the Charge of Murder, and at Said <date when="1861-11">November Term 1861</date> of Said Court Said Herndon was in court and anxious to be tried, but the Commonwealth was not ready for trial and he could not be tried, He was also present at every court held thereafter. and anxious for a trial until the <date when="1863-05">May Term 1863</date> of Said Court. At which time. he had by some means become connected with the late Rebellion against the United States Government, And was in the vicinity of owenton at the time the court, was being held, but fearful of being arrested by Soldiers of the United States who were present in owenton at the time, Said Herndon would not attend the Court:</p>
<p>At the succeeding terms of Said<pb/>
<lb/>Court Said Herndon was in the Military prison at Rock Island Illinois, and though anxious for a trial he could not be released by the military authorities of the United States, So that he could come here for trial</p>
<p>Your Petitioners Say that all the obligors in Said Bail Bond are poor men and insolvent, and unable to pay any portion of Said Bond except M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Hatton and Threlkeld who will have the whole of it to pay, if payed at all: That they are men of verry moderate means, with large and helpless families, dependant on their labor for a support: That they have done all they could to have Said Herndon before the Court at its former terms Since Said Bail Bond was executed: And your Petitioners feel Satisfied that not a case, has ever been presented to your Excellency more deserving of Executive clemency than this</p>
<p>Your Petitioners therefore most respectfully pray your Excellency to remit the penalty of Said Bond, And your petitioners will ever pray &amp;c Owenton Ky <date when="1865-11-24">Nov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1865</date>.</p>
