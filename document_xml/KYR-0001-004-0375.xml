   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of kentucky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>In <date when="1862-07">July 1862</date> I was recruiting in Covington Kenton Co, Ky a Company for the Seventh Ky Cavalry, Col Leonidas Metcalfe commanding. He gave Major R. C. Bocking written authority to raise three companies, to constitute the third Battallion of said Regiment, Major R. C. Bocking gave me written authority to recruit a company for his Battallion. In the month aforesaid <date when="1862-07">July 1862</date>, Major R. C. Bocking received written authority from Col Leonidas Metcalfe to press horses for the service of the State of Kentucky in the Counties of Kenton and Boone with blank Rail Road passes to be filled by said Major R. C. Bocking to ship the horses to the camp at Cynthiana Ky.</p>
<p>Major R. C. Bocking then gave me written authority to press horses of certain parties<pb/>
<lb/>in the counties aforesaid viz Kenton &amp; Boone The order read thus "Capt T. T. Sharp you are hereby ordered to take <gap/> horses from <gap/> to be used for the service of the State of Kentucky, by order of Col Leonidas Metcalfe, Major R. C. Bocking commanding Third Batt. 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Cavalry." I then proceeded to execute the order and among the number, was one horse from T. D. Kennedy, I delivered the said horse to Major R. C. Bocking in Covington Ky, and he shipped it to the camp at Cynthiana, Ky, as the Rail Road receipts for that month will show.</p>
<p>Major R. C. Bocking is now in the state of Indiana recruiting for the 23<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rd</hi></hi> Battery of Artillery, where he is located I am unabled to say, he has all the papers, receipts, &amp;c for the pressing of horses, recruiting for his Battallion of the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Cavalry, and therefore I am unable to procure the necessary documents to show under whose orders I acted, but the facts in the case, are as above set forth.</p>
<p>T. T. Sharp</p>
<p>Subscribed &amp; sworn to before me this <date when="1863-12-15">15" day of December A D 1863</date></p>

<p>In <date when="1863-07">July 1863</date>, I was arrested in Covington Ky, on a charge of Felony, an indictment was found against me for unlawfully taking a horse from one T. D. Kennedy. I gave bail in the sum of $200<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> Mr L. D. Cronniger of Covington Ky as Surety and <gap/> Chatfield of Cincinnati as Co surety.</p>
<p>I now ask your Excellency to relieve my sureties, as the property taken was for the service of the State, and accordingly the State is responsible. I was acting under orders, from my superior officers, and do not think, my sureties or myself should be held responsible.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be
