<lb/>To His Excellency,
<lb/>Beriah Magoffin</p>
<p>The undersigned members of the present bar of Lyon Circuit Court represent that at ct's <gap/> term <date when="1859">1859</date> one George Orr was indicted for Keeping a <hi rend="str">tippling</hi> Gaming house in said county, on which a bench warrant was ordered and issued and security for his appearance required in the sum of <hi rend="str">one</hi> two hundred dollars -- That Barney Orr, and Nathan Barnett were the sureties for the appearance of said George Orr and for his complying with the judgment of said Court in said case ^at its <date when="1861-04">next April term</date>^ That at the <date when="1860-07">last July term</date> of said Court said time for holding the same <hi rend="str">being</hi> having been changed <hi rend="str">before</hi> ^from^ the time for which said George Orr was required to appear, and the publication of said change ^not^ being made said George did appear when he was required by his bond so to do, but did not appear at the <date when="1860-07">July term</date>, the change having been made from <date when="1860-04">April,</date> to <date when="1860-07">July</date> -- That said bond was then taken as forfeited, and as your petitioners think, improperly; And that at the present term, now in session, judgment was had against said Barney Orr and Nathan Barnett on said bond -- Your petitioners think that under the circumstances so much of said forfeiture as your Excellency can remit, out to be remitted by all means, and that said pardon be<pb/>
<lb/>discharged from pay^ing^ the same to the state They also desire your Excellency to take into consideration the distressing financial condition of the Country, and if possible, to grant relief to these worthy citizens, who are poor, Said Barny Orr being wholly insolvent</p>
<p>Respectfully
