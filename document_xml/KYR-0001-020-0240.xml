<lb/></hi>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed we send you a Petition for the pardon of Micheal Ginney who was convicted of the crime of Grand Larceny at the last Term of the Fulton Equity &amp; Criminal Court his honor Judge J M Bigger presiding.</p>
<p>We acted in defence of this unfortunate man and were clearly convinced of his innocence of the crime of which he was convicted. The impression is almost unanimous among those here who know the man &amp; the circumstances of his case</p>
<p>It struck his Honor Judge Bigger so forcibly that he assured us of his intention to write to Excellency immediately on behalf of Ginney &amp; solicit his pardon at your hands. He also gave us permission to affix his name to the petition.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth's Attorney Thos M Corbet Esq also Joins in the petition. Seven<pb/>
<lb/>of the Jury have affixed their signatures and two more gave us permission to put down their names. We could readily obtain the names of more than a hundred of our citizens but deemed it unnecessary when we had the signatue &amp; cooperation of both Judge &amp; Prosecuting attorney.</p>
<p>We presume by this time your honor has received a letter from Judge Bigger on the subject &amp; that under the circumstances you will not hesitate to do an act of mercy entirely consistent with your strict duty indeed we think it is as meritorius a case as ever was presented to your consideration</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Your Obedient Svts
<lb/>Roulhac &amp; Lauderdale</p>
