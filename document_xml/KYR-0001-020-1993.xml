   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky!</p>
<p>Upon the solicitation of M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> Short, who in the bearer of these few times I would respectfully draw the attention of your Excellency to the case of her son Albert Short, now in the Kentucky Penitentiary for passing counterfeit money. The mother of the young man was with you already once and presented a petition for his pardon. It might not be improper to state to you the real circumstances of his arrest and conviction. The young man left his home here at Indianapolis in seach of a situation in Cincinnati, ^or^ other river town, but not finding work immediately he sold his watch to another man, who offert him a good price for the same The money so received appeared to be conterfeit money and finding this to be true, he wanted the watch returned. The other man told him the money was good and if would go with him he would exchange it. They both went over to Covington and the other man went into a place to get it changed or part of the money, but being discovered, was arrested as also young Short and some of the money being found on young Short he was found guilty. Young Short would have no doubt have been acquitted if the inhabitants of<pb/>
<lb/>Covington had not been prejudiced in the premises by the exscape from Jail of the guilty <unclear/> young Short making no defense, <unclear/> <unclear/> who he was no from wheare he came, being ashamed and fearing that his poor mother and his friends and acquaintances should hear, that he had been implicated in a criminal act, and he would rather suffer the punishment in silence. It was some times afterwards that accidently his mother heard of the circumstances and shortly after that, she presented herself ^to^ your Exelency a petition. These are about the facts as elicited since his conviction from citizen of Covington in your State. The mother not being well versed in the english language wished me to make these short statement of the case. The young man from all information is not corrupted and the officers of your penetentiary give him a good name in every respect as industrious, and as far as they can judge morally good, and he being, so yet, would it not be better for his morals, he only being about 19 years old, having now been confined one year, to pardon him and let him return to his sorehearted mother, as to retain him in company of men, of whom the majority certianly, is vicious and immoral. I hope to God that the<pb/>
<lb/>appeals of the poor mother may not be in vain with your Exelency</p>
<p>Respectfully in behalf of the mother your truly
<lb/>C. G. Werbe</p>
