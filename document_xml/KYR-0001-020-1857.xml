<lb/>To His Excellency B. Magoffin Esq
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky </p>
<p>We the undersigned Citizens of Caldwell County Kentucky Would respectfully represent unto your Excellency that at the <date when="1860-06">June Term 1860</date> of the Caldwell Circuit Court a judgment was rendered by said Court against Nancy Jones and her Bail John W. Davis for $100 besides Costs, This is the fact of the case Nancy Jones was a Witness for Commonwealth in a persecution against Williams, She failed to attend on subpoena. was attached and Davis went Bail for her appearance she attended several days of the Term. But failed to be present when the case was called and her Bond was taken as forfeited, Miss Jones is a poor Girl lives 12 Miles from the county Seat and had no horse to ride and as we are informed did absolutely attend Court afoot for several days. Walking to and from court several times to save her bail and give her evidence. It will be impossible for Miss Jones to pay the fine or any part of it she is entirely without means only from her daily labour which barely furnishes her a support -- Her Bail -- Davis Since the forfeiture has had his Shoulder Broke. So as to unfit him for labour (which was his means of support for self &amp; family He being an humble farmer) Now we submit the facts to your Excellency whether it is a case for the interposition of Executive clemency --. </p>

<p>The statements made in the foregoing petition of John W,, Davis are true -- and the payment of the judgments will be oppressive on said Davis -- and it would certainly be proper to relieve him as far as possible under the circumstances of his case</p>
