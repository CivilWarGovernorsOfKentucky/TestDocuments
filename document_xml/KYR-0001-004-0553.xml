<lb/>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Grant Green</p>
<p>Sir. I enclose to you address a Petition for an old friend of our county and one of your old <hi rend="underline">democratic constituents</hi></p>
<p>The facts stated in the petition I know to be true, since I defended him and they were proven on his trial as alledged in the Petition. I am a stranger to the Governor and for that reason have not enclosed it to him directly,, I hope you will present the Petition to him and give <hi rend="str">me</hi> such assistance as the character of case requires. Let me hear from you soon,, And by so doing I will be placed under lasting obligations to you</p>
<p>Very Truly &amp;c
<lb/>R. W. Wake</p>
<p>P. S. Pleas to urge the weather immediately before the Gov. since executions are out &amp; the officer is urging Asbridge up to settlement</p>
<p>Wake</p>
