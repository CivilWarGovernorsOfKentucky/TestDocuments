<lb/>Hon James F Robinson
<lb/>Gov. of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In the absence of the regular Comth's atty, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Campbelle, I was by the Court appointed, Comth's Atty Protem for this Term of Muhlenberg Circuit Court. There were two Indictments No's 1 or 2 against the County Court for "failing to Keep a good and Sufficient Jail" -- No. 1. was tried and the Jury found a verdict vs each member of the Court for fifty dollars -- No 2 was called &amp; Defendants pleaded guilty and a fine was entered against each member for fifty dollars -- The facts developed on the trial of No. 1 Show that the county Levy has been $1.50 and was So at the time of the finding of the Indictments in <date when="1859">1859</date>-<date when="1860">1860</date> and further Show that it was mainly owing to the financial condition of the county that the Jail was not repaired And that the condition of the Jail was Such that it could not be made Safe without great cost almost enough to build a new -- and the court had taken Steps to Erect a new one, In fact that the court was acting as it thought in good faith and for the best interests of the county -- So I think that the fines upon them Should be remitted The facts present a case that calls for Executive Clemency and could your honor remit the Same no injustice would be done any one, and the individual members of the Court would be profoundly grateful.</p>
<p>With very great respt
