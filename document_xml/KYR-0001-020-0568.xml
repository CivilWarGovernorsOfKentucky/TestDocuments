<p>Charles E Hood Stands convicted in the Lawrence Quarterly Court of carrying concealed Deady Weapons I was present at the trial &amp; am conversant with the facts connected with the case</p>
<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hood been badly Beaten by a man in Lawrence Co. whose relations were very hostile to Hood. Hood attending a Law Term shortly after the ill treatment where his antagonist &amp; relations were compelled to be and whilst there they had him arested tried &amp; convicted. Hood not knowing anything about our Laws and being unprepared made no defence &amp; was accordingly fined <unclear/> prosecuted an appeal to the Quarterly Court which is as dismissed for an unfortunately in the Justices transcript &amp; Judgment vs him as before</p>
<p>To my personal knowledge Hood had a Just &amp; good defence He could have proven by winesses with whom I have coversed that his life was threated &amp; that there<pb/>
<lb/>good grounds for his beliving he would be assaulted on that day &amp; that Hood knew this</p>
<p>Under these facts I would most respectfully ask your Excellency to interpose in his behalf as I think it rather a hard case Hood is a man of a Family</p>
