<lb/>Gov. Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I have known Joseph Temple lately convicted of false swearing in the Kenton Circuit Court, for nine years past. He is an old man now upwards of sixty years of age &amp; has a large &amp; interesting family, hitherto highly respectable. I heard a portion of the evidence in the trial, &amp; feel satisfied from my knowledge of the man as well as the evidence heard by me that he could not have been <hi rend="underline">wilfully</hi> guilty of the offense, though what he stated on oath may have been untrue. His confinement in the penitentiary, I believe would mark the ruin of his family. The public sentiment both of Covington &amp; Newport is one of sympathy -- the like of which I never before saw -- for the unfortunate man &amp; his family. I join in the application for the immediate exercise of Executive Clemency in Mr. Temple's case</p>
<p>Very respectfully
<lb/>James R. Hallam<pb/></p>
<p>Gov. Magoffin
<lb/>Frankfort
<lb/>Ky.
<lb/>pr Col. Hodge</p>
