   <p>To His Excellency, The Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your petitioner, John Cawein respectfully states that on the <date when="1861-02-04">4th day of February 1861</date> in the City Court of Louisville, he entered into a recognizance as a witness, in the sum of $100, to appear before the Grand Jury of the Criminal Court of Jefferson County, Ky to testify in behalf of the Commonwealth of Ky against Chas Greer, charged with a felony, at the <date when="1861-05">May</date> term of said Court.</p>
<p>That on the <date when="1861-05-16">16th day of May, 1861</date> said recognizance was forfeited by reason of your petitioner failing to appear to testify.</p>
<p>Your petitioner states that he would have appeared cheerfully to testify but he did not know at what time he had to appear and supposed he would be notified when to appear -- He is quite ignorant of all legal proceedings, &amp; in fact did not understand that any day was fixed when he Entered into the recognizance to appear.</p>
<p>As before remarked your petitioner would have cheerfully appeared to testify, in fact, the felony charged to have been committed by Greer, was the stealing of your petitioners' over coat. In view of the premises, your petitioner humbly prays your Excellency to release him from the penalties of the forfeiture by a remission, &amp; he ever will &amp;c.</p>
<p>Your petitioner would further add that the indictment<pb/>
<lb/>for the offense has been returned against Greer &amp; the case was continued and is set for trial at the coming <date when="1861-10">October</date> term of the Court -- That your petitioner is and has long been a resident of Louisville, Ky and will certainly appear to testify on the trial of the indictment if in health.</p>
