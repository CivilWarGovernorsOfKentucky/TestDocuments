   <p>To His Excellency Thos. E. Bramlette Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your petitioner John Moore respectfully represents to your Excellency that at the <date when="1863-02">February term 1863</date> of the Franklin Circuit Court, one Henry Woodward was fined the sum of $100 for an assault &amp; battery on one Moses Glove &amp; family.</p>
<p>The said Woodward being a youth under twenty one years of age, and a nephew of your petitioners wife, your petitioner, together with Lucy Moore &amp; Frank Patterson replevied said fine as the securities of said Woodward.</p>
<p>An execution has issued on said replevin bond and is now in the hands of the sheriff of Franklin County for collection, and he will be compeled to pay the same unless relieved by your Excellency.</p>
<p>He states that he is a very poor man, dependent alone upon his daily labor for his support, and could not pay said fine and costs without a ruinous sacrifice of what little property he possesses. He states that he has a wife and seven small children dependent entirely upon him for a support.</p>
<p>That neither said Woodward nor the other two securities have any means or estate out of which any part of said fine can be made and the whole will fall upon him.</p>
<p>He states that he has always been an industrious peaceable &amp; good citizen, and had no connection whatever with the offense for<pb/>
<lb/>which said Woodward was fined, and was only induced to become his security from feelings of humanity, and to release his said nephew from jail, by having been placed in the jail of Franklin County for said fine, before your petitioner replevied the same.</p>
<p>He states that said Woodward when he repleived said fine, faithfully promised your petitioner if he was released from jail, he would go to work and make the money to pay said fine &amp; costs by the maturity of said replevin bond, and thereby relieve your petitioner from its payment. On the contrary said Woodward has done nothing towards its payment, and has left the whole amount to be paid by your petitioner.</p>
<p>He states that he could although at great inconvenience to himself and family, raise the money to pay the costs &amp; the portion of the fine going to the Commonwealths attorney, if your Excellency would remit the balance of said fine. And in consideration of the premises your petitioner respectfully asks your Excellency to remit said fine <hi rend="str">and</hi> except so much thereof as may by law be due to said attorney for the Commonwealth. And as is duty bound he will ever pray &amp;c</p>
