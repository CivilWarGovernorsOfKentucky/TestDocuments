   <p>Cynthiana Kentucky.
<lb/><date when="1865-04-11">April 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1865</date>
<lb/>Hon. Thomas. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Frankfort, Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>The vote of the citizens of this place for Mayor on the <date when="--04-01">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of April</date> has been certified to you. We understand that an effort is being made to have I. T. Martin commissioned as Mayor. We would beg to submit a few facts why he should not be and why Mr Land should.</p>
<p>By Sec. 20, Page, 194 Acts 1849.50 you will see that you have the power to commission either of the two men who are certified to you, nothing confines your power, to the one receiving the higest number of votes. This the charter of Augusta was by an act of 1859.60 made the charter of this place.</p>
<p>Mr. I. T. Martin is a full bread Yankee, with strong Southern feelings, has been arrested three times charged with aiding the rebels, he is a rich man, and does not need the office. On the other hand Mr. Land is a Union man, a native of Kentucky, a high gentleman, a poor man with a large familly<pb/>
<lb/>and needs the office, has once filled the place with diginity, and satisfaction to the people. Mr Martin has seen three times for the office since <date when="1860">1860</date>, has been beaten each time. If we thought it necessary or that you would require it we confidently think that we could prove one more illegal vote for Martin which would make a tie, but believing that you can &amp; will commission Mr Land upon the state of facts as here represented &amp; in the letter of Mr A H Ward, we have concluded not to take any proof until we hear further from you.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully Yours
<lb/>C. Walton
<lb/>M. L. Broadwell
<lb/>J. Q. Ward</p>
<p>N. B. Mr. Land was badly wounded in the fight against Morgan in <date when="1862-07">July 1862</date>, and is a cripple for life.</p>
<p>J. Q. W.</p>
