   <p>Gov Thomas. E. Bramlett
<lb/>Frankfort Ky</p>
<p>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir Enclosed I send you a petition for George W Kinsor for the purpose of getting a fine remitted. I have been acquainted with Mr Kinsor for several years. I am satisfied that the statements in his petition are true, and I think him to be an honest industrious obedient citizen he has been living on the road leading to Cumberland Gap. and has suffered a good ^deal^ from the rebels, by them taking from him I dont think he means or intends to violate any of the laws knowingly. His petition as you will see is endorsed by all or nearly so of the officials of the County and by many prominent Union men of the County beliving that you will make that disposition of his case that should be done</p>
<p>I am Sir Respectfully
<lb/>F. P. Stickley
<lb/>Barbourville Ky
