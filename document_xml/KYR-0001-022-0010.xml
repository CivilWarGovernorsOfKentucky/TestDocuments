<lb/>Executive Department,

<lb/>SIR:</p>
<p>I am directed by GOVERNOR MORGAN to ask your attention to the regulations issued from this Department under date of the <date when="1861-01-01">1st of January, 1861,</date> in regard to applications for Requisitions on the Governors of other States for the surrender of fugitives from justice; and to inform you that he deems it necessary that the following <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> requirement should be observed in every case:</p>
<p>It must be shown, by affidavit duly verified, that the party complained of is a fugitive from justice; and that, according to the best knowledge and belief of the affiant, the alleged fugitive is, at the time of making the application, in the State upon which a Requisition is asked, and the grounds of such belief must be specifically set forth in such affidavit.</p>
<p>I am, very truly,
<lb/>Yours, &amp;c.
<lb/>LOCKWOOD L. DOTY,
<lb/>Private Secretary.</p>
