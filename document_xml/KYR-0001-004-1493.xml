<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me this <date when="1865-02-20">20<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of February 1865</date> by James C. Gill, Coroner of Jefferson County</p>
<p>Phil Tomppert Jr C C C L<pb/></p>
<p>Govenor Bramlett
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Some time ago a petition in favor of Martin Pendegrass was sent you. Some nine or ten of the Jury recomended him to your Excellency as a proper person for Clemency. He was convicted for two years, <hi rend="underline">the</hi> lowest term for Manslaughter. The conviction was made upon the evidence of Mrs Burke who swore before the coroner that she did not see deceased stated, see Coroners affidavit, This she swore also in the examining court, but before the Jury she swore she saw Pendegrass when he did the stabing. Pendegrass remained in the county Jail for one year before he could have his trial, He proved a most exelent Character when he was tried, &amp; most of the Jury was eager to sign in his behalf. We Join in the prayre of the petitioner not as his feed Counsel, but do so because he is a fellow creature, &amp; worthy of the clemency he asks in his petition</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Baird &amp; Price</p>
