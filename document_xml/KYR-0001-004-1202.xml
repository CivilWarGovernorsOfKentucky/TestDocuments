<lb/><date when="1864-09">Sept'r <gap/> 1864</date>
<lb/>To
<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Thos. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Gov. of Ky.</p>
<p>We the undersigned would respectfully submit that Thos Nave -- was fined Thirty five dollars ($35 <hi rend="sup">x</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi>) at the <date when="1863-10">Oct term ^1863^</date> of the Louisville City Court. for an assault committed in this city. The costs in the case amount to some fifty odd dollars, which is in itself a fine sufficient in our opinion.</p>
<p>Since the finding the defendent Thomas Nave has been confined to his bed nearly the whole time, unable to do any work He is a poor man; and will be unable to pay the fine. He can only be forced from his family, which is entirely dependent on his daily labor for their support.</p>
<p>Wherefore we pray that Executive clemency be Extended him; believing if you remit the fine, the warning will be sufficient to prevent any repetition of his offense.</p>
<p>Thos Nave<pb/></p>
<p>Mr Nave is a married man, and for a long time past has been unable, on account of ill health, to labor much, Considering his condition, and that of his family, I think that Executive Clemency may reasonably be extended to him by a respite. The officers to whom he owes the costs have so far not Exacted the payment of their fees, on account of his health,</p>
