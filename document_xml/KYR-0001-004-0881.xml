<lb/>Gov Bramlette</p>
<p>At this term of the LaRue Circuit Court I have rendered a Judgment against the securities of H. E. Read on a Bail Bond excecuted by them some years ago- He was charged with shooting and I suppose would have appeared but some time afterward the War opened and he Read put out to Rebeldom where he has remained as a member of their Congress</p>
<p>These three sureties but Wilson alone is responsible. The Bond is small being, I now remember for $200. </p>
<p>Mr. Chapeze the Comlths Atto was willing that I might remit all except his <unclear>percention</unclear> but in order to get that it was necessary that Judment should go for the entire am<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson the only responsible man is a good citizen and I am certain had every ground to believe Read would appear_ He also suffered at the hands of Guerilla muarauders in fact is one those frail mortals that falls in <hi rend="str">for</hi> as endorsed for most of the bad Debts in the Community </p>
<p>Under the Circumstances I feel authorised to request you to remit this Judgement as far as you can The Judgment is against Samuel Wilson &amp; others as you will see from a copy of it</p>
