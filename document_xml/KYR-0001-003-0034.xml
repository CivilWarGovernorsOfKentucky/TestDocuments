<lb/>Mr. <unclear>Hagain</unclear> </p>
<p>I Send you a copy of a plan for a Gun &amp; I wish the Legislatrue, would adopt it. for the State &amp; national Defence</p>
<p>If I do what I <hi rend="str">can</hi> am Satisfied &amp; can Do I will accomplish Somthing, towards puting Down this Rebellion</p>
<p>I am Satisfied of its practible advantages over any other kind of Gun Particularly at Depots Rail RoadsStations also it can be carried on the cars for Defence Between Stations</p>
<p>fifteen or twenty, men can Successfully Resist an attack of five Hundred men, Either Cavelry or infantry, as you will See from its Construction</p>
<p>you will See that it Shoots Spirrelly &amp; you can take any Range that is necssary to Suit any locality. &amp; will not be Subject to panic, or Reckless Shooting it is mounted on wheels &amp; can be Drawn By Horses like other Guns,</p>
<p>it is pited in the Ground, &amp; the men that work it, are Secure under the Surface having nothing do, But Down alternatly ^Each^ End, of the Beam which works all the Small Machinery, &amp; firing the Guns, throwing thousands of Shot, every minuit. So that the Idea of Surrounding me is an impossibility<pb/></p>
<p>you See from the doted lines how far it is thrown above the Surface of the Ground</p>
<p><figure/><pb/>
<lb/>you can throw at least 5000 Shot every minuit By But few men</p>
<p><figure/>
<lb/>There is a plain view of one of the Batteries &amp; you can make your own calculation about <hi rend="str">your</hi> its Destructiveness</p>
<p>I have not Shown the Small <unclear/> work, as you might not understand it,</p>
<p>It can be made light &amp; can be Handled By two men,</p>
<p><figure/>
<lb/>Most men are Sanguin in their own calculation &amp; I am like others But Just as <unclear/> as the Mechanical laws work out correctly I can do more with this plan of a Gun than any other that has Been yet Invented,</p>
<p>I have filed Specification &amp; Drawing &amp; can get a pattent, But that wont make the Guns, consequently unless the Government takes hold of it it will be without their Benefit,</p>
<p>yours Resply
<lb/>Joseph.H. Glover</p>
