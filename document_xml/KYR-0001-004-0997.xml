   <p>State of Kentucky. Metcalfe County.</p>
<p>We C C Harvey &amp; P S Rush state that we are now, and have been personally acquainted with John Branstetter- an old infirm man of this county- for a good many years. he has been the most of his time, a sober, discreet, &amp; orderly walking old man, he would however occasionally indulge to excess in the use of intoxicating liquor, and while under the influence of drink, would frequently become rather wild or delirious.</p>
<p>We are also well acquainted with the persons-H. A. &amp; N. G. Morgan- with whom he was found gaming on his premises for which he-the said Branstetter-has been indicted &amp; fined the sum of $200.</p>
<p>They are regarded as regular set gamblers, &amp; he was doubtless induced by them to take the game for which said fine has been imposed, whilst under the influence of drink.</p>
