Daody, G. W. Graves, J. M. Boarman and W. R. Mitchell are and have been strong rebels from the commencement of the war -- and were by many good Union men believed to be acting in concert and complicity with the Rebels under John Morgan and various Guerilla bands, which infested this section of the state -- M. Daody was a long time in a military prison by order of Gen Buell -- Graves is and has been and open and Expressive sympathizer -- Boarman had a son with Morgan -- and Mitchell had two sons in the guerilla bands -- One of them you will recollect was near being shot at Lexington but made his Escape The same on who robbed Wolfords Chaplain -- Mr Russell before the war was an orderly good citizen -- And since the suppression of guerillas has behaved Exceedingly well -- Two of the prosecutors (to wit) J. M. Boarman and W. K. Mitchell have signed the petition to your Excellency -- The robbery consisted only in taking pistols from the parties which have been returned -- Mr Russell has rendered valuable service<pb/> 
<lb/>to the Union men of the county in protecting them from guerillas Any number of names could be abtained to within petition if deemed necessary -- The pardon of Russell would be received with joy by all the Union citizens of Marion and Taylor counties</p>
<p>Yours &amp;C
<lb/>J. R. Thomas</p>
