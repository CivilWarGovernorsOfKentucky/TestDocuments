   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of the state of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned state that they are acquainted with the Petitioner William Turner -- he is a discreet prudent and highly moral citizen -- he has reared his family to habits of sobriety industry morality and economy. From extreme poverty by a praiseworthy and commendable course he has placed his family in the best of society and taught them in the paths of rectitude, and the unfortunate estrangement of his son, has produced universal astonishment, so much so, that no doubt is entertained, but that he was served with a temporary aberration of mind when he is alledged to have committed the act for which he was araigned.</p>
<p>He was found in possession of a noted horse of one of his nearest neighbors, and within a few miles of home, in a town near bye, he registers his name and post office and offers the horse at public sale in the market -- He manifested no concealment, and talked freely of his purposes and designs without regard to any apprehension of a violation of law -- </p>
<p>His conduct prior to the above act was marked with prudence and discretion, and we feel that we do but justice to an unfortunate family, to endorse their public and private worth -- We feel a deep sympathy for the almost disconsolate father, and think that we but serve the purpose of good citisenship, to appeal to your Excellency to relieve in part his afflictions by asking that the penalty for his forfeited bond be remitted</p>
