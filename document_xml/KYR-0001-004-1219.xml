At the <date when="1864-07">July Term 1864,</date> of the Warren Circuit Court, your petitioner made no resistance to the indictment found against him for the aforesiad offense, and was fined therefor $50 <hi rend="sup">25</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi>. Your petitioner feeling conscious of his innocence, and knowing that he did not willfully violate the law, asks your Excellency to release him from the afsd fine so far, and to such an extent as you have the constitutional power.</p>
<p>Very respectfully
<lb/>T. D. Hastings</p>
