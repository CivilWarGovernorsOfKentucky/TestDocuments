   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>We the undersign composing the Jury that tried Mary Flinn at this term of the Jefferson circuit court and convicted her to the Penitentiary for the term of one year would most respectfully and ernestly represent her to your Excellency as a proper subject for the Executive clemency. She is a middle aged woman and present a very respectable appearance. This is the first time she has ever been arraigned before one court for any offense. We therefore sincerly pray your Excellency to extend to her the Executive clemency.</p>

<p>The facts in this case are briefly as follows. Mary Flinn was working at the Galt House as chamber maid at the time a breast-pin was missing. valued at eighteen hundred Dollars. The diamond belonging to the pin was found upon the floor of the room occupied by the owner of the breast pin- but the gold encasing valued at about eight Dollars was found in the possession of Mary Flinn who says she found it. but as she could not prove that fact the Jury found a verdict of guilty and sentenced her to the Penitentiary for one year</p>
<p>But in their verdict they recommend her to the clemency of your Excellency the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Respectfully</p>
