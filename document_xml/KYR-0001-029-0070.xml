   <p>To His Excellency,
<lb/>The Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your petitioner, Kauffman Kramer, respectfully states that, being indicted in the Jefferson Circuit Court for larceny, he was tried on said indictment on the <date when="1862-10-23">23<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> Oct. 1862</date>, found guilty and his term of imprisonment in the Penetentiary fixed at 18 months.</p>
<p>Your petitioner states that it is true the matters proved on the trial were such as to induce the belief that he was guilty and to justify the verdict of the Jury, but, in truth, your petitioner had no felonious intent.</p>
<p>He had been trading in buying up old silver, &amp; with this view had previously been to the house where the offence was shown to have been comitted &amp; had been told to call again -- this your petitioner did, on the day of the alleged commission of the offense, &amp; on entering the room found no one in it, -- he had been in the room but a moment &amp; was looking at some spoons &amp; took them in his hand when the lady of the house ^entered from the adjoining room &amp;^ called out to him in a loud voice charging him with attempting to steal -- Your petitioner at once laid down the spoons &amp; a gentleman of the house entered from the adjoining room.</p>
<p>Your petitioner having just been charged with attempt to steal, though innocent, felt that <pb/>
<lb/>that he might be chastised by the gentleman who had just entered, &amp;, to save himself from personal injury, ran away. He was pursued at once and arrested. Your petitioner took nothing from the premises. He states that he is an old man, now in the 69<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his age &amp; has a wife and child &amp; grand children resident in Louisville, Ky.</p>
<p>In tender consideration of the premises, and for the sake also of your petitioner's wife who is quite infirm and far advanced in life, being in the 74<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of her age and for the sake of his married daughter &amp; his grand children, your petitioner humbly appeals to you for Executive Clemency and prays that you may pardon him.</p>
<p>He begs to make this appeal to you not only as the chief Magistrate of the State but as a husband &amp; father. The remnant of your petitioner's days is but few &amp; his health but moderate, and he hopes, through your mercy, to be permitted to spend the balance of his life with ^his^ wife &amp; children &amp; that they may be spared the mortification of having the husband &amp; father committed to confinement in the penetentiary.</p>
<p>He humbly prays &amp; he ever will &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>

<p>The Undersigned were Jurors in the case against Kauffman Kramer; and, in view of the circumstances which have come to our knowledge since the trial, we recommend him to Executive Clemency and join with him in his prayer. <date when="1862-10-24">Oct 2<hi rend="str">5</hi>4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1862</date>.</p>
