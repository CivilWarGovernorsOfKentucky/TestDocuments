<p>Your petitioners state that they were sureties on the recognizance of one <persName ref="cwgk:N00007333">Henry Raines</persName>, for his appearance to answer an indictment against him in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000397">Henderson Circuit Court</orgName> for a misdemeanor, The indictment was tried and judgment rendered against Raines thereon for the sum of twenty dollars -- He having failed to appear, judgment was <hi rend="str">at</hi> rendered against the petitioners on his recognizance for the sum of fifty dollars &amp; costs, They enclose herewith a statement of the judgments certified by the clerk of the court, They are willing to pay the amount of the judgment against Raines, which was all the Commonwealth would have demanded of him had he appeared. They feel assured that she is not disposed to speculate on them for his absence, which of itself is a gain to her, They therefore respectfully petition your Excellency to remit the excess of the judgment against them, over that against Raines -- And they will ever pray &amp;c</p>
