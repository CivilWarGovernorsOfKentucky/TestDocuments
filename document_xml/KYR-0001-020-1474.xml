  <body>
   <p>To his Excellency B Magoffin Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully represent that Geo Knorr was heretofore convicted of manslaughter in the Campbell Circuit Court at the <gap/> term thereof and sentenced to confinement in the Penitentiary where he now is, They would farther state that Knorr had sustained a good character up to the time of the offense for which he was convicted and the commision of which was in a sudden affray growing out of reports derogatory to the character of Knorrs wife which had been circulated by the party for whos homicide Knorr was convicted,</p>
<p>It appears that Knorr has a wife &amp; child dependant upon him for support &amp; who are in dectitute circumstances, that he was confined a long time in Jail before he has a trial; and believing that the ends of justice do not demand his further confinement in the Penitentiary your petitioners pray your Excellency ^in the exercise of the divine atribute of mercy^ to restore him to his liberty and his family -- Campbell County Ky <date when="1861-10-18">October 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>/61</date></p>
