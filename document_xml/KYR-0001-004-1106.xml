<lb/>Gov Thos. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort. Ky -- </p>
<p>We your petitioners, confectioners in the Town of Bowling Green Ky. would respectfully represent that some months ago, in the course of our business we sold a few packages of playing cards, without previously taking out the license required by the Statutes. we committed no willful breach of the law, as we were not at the time aware of the duty incumbent upon us to procure said license. At the last term of the Warren circuit Court, we made no opposition to the indictment found against us, and were fined $50 <hi rend="sup">25</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi> and costs. We earnestly petition your Excellency to remit so much of the assd fine, as you have the constitutional power to do.</p>
<p>Your obdt Servants.
<lb/>Art &amp; Sloyer</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Bowling Green Ky, personally acquainted with the above petitinoers Art &amp; Sloyer, beg leave to state that we know them to be clever, law-abiding men and of<pb/>
<lb/>moderate means, and we therefore recommend them as deserving of executive clemency, and join in the prayer of their foregoing petition.</p>
