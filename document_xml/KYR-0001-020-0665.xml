<p>I attended to the case of the Commonwealth against Polly Ratliff charged with fornication she is a very poor women without friends to assist her and her only hope for a living depends on her own labor her neighbors say that she has bore the name of a correct woman &amp; I can say she is not a prostitute but on the contrary is a hard working &amp; honest woman &amp; never before was charged with being anything of the sort to my knowledge or belief</p>
