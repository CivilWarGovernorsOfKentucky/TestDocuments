   <p>B Magoffin
<lb/>To the Hon, Governor of Ky
<lb/>You Petitioner</p>
<p>James M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Laughlin would respectfully represent to your Honour that at the <date when="1861-09">Sept Term 1861</date> he was fined by the judge of said ^the Kenton circuit^ Court the sum of fifty dollars and costs for selling Liquor to a minor a young man by the Edw<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Blackburn a son of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Blackburn of this city who your petitioner thought was 21 years of age but it turned out other wise, your petitioner further states that he Replevied the fine and costs on the <date when="1861-12-17">17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> sept 1861</date> for three months and will be compelled to pay the same unless your honour will use your clemency in his favour and remit such portion as you can and save him from paying the whole fine he says he was not disposed to violate the law but done it in ignorance therefore he pays your honour for relief and your Petitioner will ever pray &amp;C</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">James M</hi><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi><hi rend="underline">Laughlin</hi></p>
<p>We the undersigned coincide with the Petitioner Ja<hi rend="sup">s</hi> M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Laughlin and Ask that the Honorable B Magoffin Governor as aforesaid will use his clemency and remit the fine as far as you can and your petitioner will Ever pray &amp;C</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">S. C. Perrin</hi></p>
<p>The Liquor, as the proof shewed, was not sold to young Blackburn by the Petitioner, but by his Barkeeper in the<pb/>
<lb/>absence and without the knowledge of Petitioner. The Petitioner is a worthy citizen and a law abiding man and in my opinion altogether worthy of the Executive clemency.</p>

<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Arthur's statement of the case makes out a strong case for Executive interpostition -- &amp; I cordially unite with him in <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>its exercise in the present case. I know nothing of the facts -- </p>
