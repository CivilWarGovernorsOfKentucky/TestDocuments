   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Hon <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thomas Bramlet</persName><lb/>Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners <persName ref="cwgk:N002040">Robt. F. Baird</persName> &amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N002014">J. H. Price</persName>, would respectfully state that they went upon the Bail Bond of<persName ref="cwgk:N00000707"> John Leavy</persName> for $400<hi rend="sup">00/00</hi> to answer at the January term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O001000">Jefferson Circuit Court</orgName>. Said Leavy was charged with Grand Larceny.</p>
<p>At the may term of said court a judgement was rendered against your petitioners for the said sum of $400<hi rend="sup">00/00</hi></p>
<p>Your petitioners were counsel for the said Leavy &amp; took great interest in his case &amp; believing in his innocence we went upon his bond to answer without being indemnified. Petitioners were repaid with ingratitude &amp; they now peititon your Excellency to remit the amount coming to the state, as they have already paid officers fees &amp; costs.</p>
<p>The circumstanses of the case are as follows: The said John Leavy in company with an other man steped in to the Jewelry store of <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000708">Michot &amp; Bro</orgName>; The man with Leavy asked to see a gold guard chain. A Box containing chains was set upon the show<pb/>
<lb/>case &amp; several chains examined by the man, when a third party steped in &amp; asked to see somthing else; &amp; the shopman stepping to an other part of the store to get it was detained a few moments. The article brought for the third party did not seem to suit, &amp; said third party left the store. Some little lime elaped &amp; the shopman discovered his loss, some one or two chains were taken. This discovery was made when Leavy &amp; his companion were in the store, but the third party had left.</p>
<p>The third party when in the store stood near enough to have stolen the chains. Leavy was arrested in a short time but no chains was found upon him. Leavy did not ask to see any thing while in the store.</p>
<p>Your petitioners believing that no indictment could be had &amp; believing firmly in the innocence of the party went upon his bond to answer.</p>
<p>Your petitioners respectfully ask your Excellency to remit the judgement
<lb/>Respectfully
