   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner, John Mahoney, would respectfully submit for your consideration, the following statement of facts. Under an Indictment, in the Fayette Circuit Court, for "keeping a disorderly House" and at the <date when="1864-02">Feb term 1864</date> of said Court, your petitioner was fined One Hundred dollars &amp; cents. At the time of the Indictment, your petitioner was keeping a small family Grocery in the City of Lexington, attempting to make an honest support for himself and family. Being of a weak and feeble constitution he was unable to pursue any laborious occupation. He has for some time been in the employ of the United States Government, but was compelled to quit, his health being so bad Being compelled to pay said fine, either in money or by incarceration, would act as a very great hardship on his family. He therefore prays that your Excellency will, in his behalf exercise the clemency so justly placed in your hands.</p>
<p>Sml Mahoney</p>
<p>We the undersigned would respectfully request the remission of the foregoing fine.</p>
