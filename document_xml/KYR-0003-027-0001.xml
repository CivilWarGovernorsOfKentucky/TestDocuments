   <p>EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,
<lb/>Frankfort, <date when="1863-07-27">July 27, 1863</date>.</p>
<p>When a great man dies, a nation mourns. Such an event has occurred in our midst, in the death of the Hon. John J. Crittenden, Kentucky's longest tried statesman in her public service, a man faithful to every trust, one who has added, by his talents and character, to the fame of the nation, and has pre-eminently advanced the glory and honor of his native Kentucky. It is fit and proper that all testimonials of respect and affection should be paid his remains by all in authority, as well as by private citizens. I, therefore, earnestly request that all places of business shall be closed on WEDNESDAY NEXT, from the hours of 10 o'clock in the morning until 5 of the afternoon, and hereby direct all the public offices in Frankfort, to be closed during that entire day, and I appoint Gen. JOHN W. FINNELL, Col. JAMES H. GARRARD, and Col. ORLANDO BROWN a Committee to make all suitable arrangements for the funeral.</p>
<p>J. F. ROBINSON.</p>
