   <p>To his Excellency, Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Goevernor of Kentucky </p>
<p>The petition of George J. Ju<hi rend="str">d</hi>tt, respectfully represents that at the last January term of the City Court of Louisville he was tried on an Indictment for selling liquor without license and his fine assessed at twenty dollars and costs. Since then he has taken out a license and paid into the ciry Treasury the money for the same. He humbly represents that he is a poor man with a large family dependent upon him and that he will be unable to pay the above sum without great distress. He is doing but little business and nothing but his poverty prevented him from obtaining a license, as he fully inteded before the above indictment was preferred. He earnestly asks <hi rend="str">that</hi> that Executive clemency may be exercied in his behalf and that the above fine may be remitted and he will ever pray &amp;c. </p>

<p>Mr. Jutt is a very poor man -- of family -- he has paid about $70 -- fine for selling without license -- I know he could not pay for license -- but did so -- as soon as he could Raise the money, He has paid into the city Treasury the money for a license &amp; has obtained a license. Wherefore I think it would be well to remit</p>
