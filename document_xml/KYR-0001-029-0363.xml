   <p>To your Excellency James F. Robinson
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned would represent to your Excellency that a judgment has been rendered at the present <date when="--04">April</date> term of the Pendleton Circuit Court against John Myers an old and respectable citizen of this County, for the sum of two hundred dollars on a forfeited Recognizance as bail for a certain King Plummer under a charge of Bigamy. That the recognizance was forfeited at the <date when="1862-10">October Term 1862</date> of the Pendleton Circuit Court, and a summons ordered thereon, That owing to the disturbed condition of the Country at that time, in consequence of the Rebel invasion and occupation Pendleton County, which continues up to a short time before said term of the Court, and the consequent occupation of the County by the Federal Army at the time the term was to be held and the establishment of martial law, it was not supposed by the bar, nor by the community that any court would be held, that, in fact, no regular term of the Court was held, but the judge attended and opened Court but no juries were impannelled and no causes tried, that if the fact that the Court would have been held had been known the ^said trial^ could have procured the attendance of the said Plummer in discharge of his bail,+ <note place="left margin">+ And we further state that the defendant Plummer was present at the present term of the Court and urged a trial but the Commonwealth was not ready,^</note> It is therefore respectfully asked by the undersigned members of the bar of said Court, that all of the judgment except fees &amp; costs be remitted to said Myers, and Plummer,</p>
