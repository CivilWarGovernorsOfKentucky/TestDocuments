<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I Received to day the appointment of Provost Marshall as pr Coppy of Speciall order No 2 enclosed, authorising me to organise a Citizens Gard without Pay. which I Cannot accept according to the order, I will accept the post if I am allowed to keep my Company to act as Provost Gard under Pay. I with my Co have have been dooing the duty of Provost Gard to a great extent for the last nine or ten Month<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. for the Reason that the Regullar Soldiers have all been Strangers here &amp; and I have had to furnish the men to do the duty or to act as guides for them, it is impossible to get men to do Service unless they get paid, to organise a citizens Gard it would have to be done from that class of citizens who could do without Pay. hard crackers &amp;c with a Single Blanket on a Prison Floor would not Suit them. they would not be efficient. My Men are well drilled &amp; efficient. &amp; Can do the dutty &amp; allow Raw Recruits Coming in to go into Camp &amp; become drilled Soldiers. I Refer You to Genl W A Dudley who will be in Your City to morrow Respy yours &amp;</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">J B Wilgus</hi><pb/></p>
<p>N B. I have declined the appointment to Genl Dent in letter of this date. I am Still anxious for my Battery I write this letter at the Request of Genl Dudley. </p>
