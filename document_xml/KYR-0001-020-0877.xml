<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Frankfort Ky</p>
<p>At the <date when="1859-05">May Term 1859</date> of the Fulton Equity and Criminal court H. C Laurance was Indicted by the Grand Jury of Fulton County for obtaining money under false Pretenses to the amount of about $300. he was arrested under a Bench Warrant and gave Bail in the sum of $500 -- with Jasper M. Jones, Henry Ford &amp; J W Laurence ^sureties^ and at the next Term of the court Laurence failed to appear &amp; his Bond was forfeited &amp; summons awarded vs his sureties, after the isual of the summons &amp; before the return day thereof, the sureties paid the amount of the Bond to the Clerk of the Fulton circuit Court &amp; he failed to pay it over to the trustee of the Jury fund &amp; died &amp; his sureties Also failed to pay the amount to the Trustee of the Jury fund, a response was filed upon the return of the summons, stating these facts &amp; upon Demurrer it was decided insufficient upon the ground that the money was paid to the wrong party &amp; should have been paid to the Trustee Jury fund &amp; therefore a Judgement was pronounced against the sureties in the Bail Bond &amp; execution is now in the hands of<pb/>
<lb/>the Sheriff, and the parties have requested that I should make this Statement to you. I will also State that I understand that the sureties in the Bail Bond have instituted proceedings against the surreties of the clerk to recover the money paid him, and I desire to say further that H. C Laurence has never surrended himself to answer said Indictment</p>
