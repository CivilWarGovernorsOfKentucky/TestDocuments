   <p>To the Govenor of the State of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>We whose names are hereto subscribed state that at the <date when="1864-06">June term 1864</date> of the Metcalfe Circuit Court John Bronstetter was fined by a Judgment of said Court in the sum of $200 -- upon charge of permitting gaming upon his premises. This old man is about 70 years of age has lived in this &amp; Barren Counties for many years an honest &amp; upright man, when this war commenced &amp; the Rebels invaded Kentucky two of his sons joined our independent company called the "Metcalfe Tigers" who went into the business of Bushwhacking Rebels &amp; were exposed to many dangers and the old man lost at the hands of the Rebels nearly all his ^movable^ property in consequence of which disturbances he took to drink and while in drinking sprees was sometimes almost crazy &amp; lived in the woods while in one of these drinking sprees he was induced by some gamblers to play a game at cards and in the woods which chanced to be on his own land, a witness came upon them while playing hence he was convicted &amp; fined -- </p>
<p>Now in view of the premises we believe that his fine so far as in the power of the Executive authority of the State, should be remitted, and ask that it be done -- </p>
