   <p>We the undersigned Petitioners of Clark County would respectfully state that we were acquainted with Albion T. Ryan who was indicted for the murder of Francis M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Donald and from his conduct we were of opinion He would stand his trial. We are also acquainted with Samuel W. Chiles, Joseph Jones, Richard M Webb, and we knew Caleb Parrish deceased all of whom were good Citizens, and we would most respectfully ask His Excellency Governor Thomas E Bramlette to remit the amount due the Commonwealth of Kentucky on account of the forfeited recognizance of said Ryan on his bond wherein said Chiles, Jones, Webb and deceadent Caleb Parrish were sureties. We are of opinion that if there amount is remitted no harm will result from it; and that it will be of considerable benefit to the parties. This <date when="1864-05-24">24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> May 1864</date>.</p>

<p>The facts set out by the petitioners in their affidavit are correct. I defended Ryan &amp; do not believe that he would ever have been convicted. He was a young man of excellent family &amp; most <hi rend="underline">exemplary</hi> <hi rend="underline">character</hi>. I know he has been a citizen of Mexico since <date when="1858">1858</date>. The petitioners are worthy citizens. I unite in their request</p>
