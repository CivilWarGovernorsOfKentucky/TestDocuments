<lb/>To His Excellency. Thos. E. Bramlett
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Banks a private in my Company while on detached duty at Louisville, was charged with receiving goods, knowing them, to be Stolen- and upon that charged Sent to the penitentiary. let me assure you from my personal knowledge of Said Banks that I honestly believe that he is Strictly an honest man that if he did any wrong that it was through ignorance and no wrongful intent. The case was an unfortunate one as I understand Surrounded by an array of circumstances which pointed to his guilt, which he (Banks) as a Soldier and stranger, was not permitted to explain away. The people of this community are verry much embittered against what they Call Soldier thieves and if one <hi rend="str">one</hi> is charged with a crime it is taken for granted that it is so. and I appreheand that this undue prejudice was the cause to a great extent of his conviction. He was a prompt good and faithful Soldier, and my regiment has reenlisted and I pray your Excellency to grant him the privilege of doing the Same.</p>
<p>Your obt Servt, Norman K Brown
