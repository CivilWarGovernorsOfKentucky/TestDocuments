<lb/>Gov. Bramlett
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Permit me at the instance of one old and respected lady to ask the execution of your Clemency, if not inconsistent with public interest or policy, in favour of her only and decrepid son. He stands indicted for Larceny by the grand jury of Livingston County. The facts of the case connected with the Charge I am not acquainted with but Mr Bennett is, and will give them to you candidly and fairly and if the case can be disposed of as desired, it will relieve the mother already born down by the weight of years and other bereavements and misfortunes.</p>
<p>Perhaps his greatest error is that of habitual intoxication. I learn his conduct when sober is free from objection</p>
<p>The subject of this letter is William Bellamy I suppose he is about 21 years of age.<pb/></p>
<p>I have never asked the Executive to interpose where I would not do it myself if vested with the power. I am inclined to think if it was with me at the present in view of all the circumstances as stated to me, and what I know to be the great morral worth of the mother I would set her son at liberty</p>
<p>With my highest regard
<lb/>I am dear sir your
<lb/>friend truly
<lb/>W. P. Fowler</p>
