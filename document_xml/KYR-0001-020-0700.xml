<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>B. MaGoffin

<lb/>Ky -- 
<lb/>My Dear Governor-</p>
<p>This will be handed you by Mrs. Powell, the wife of J. H. Powell, who was convicted at our recent term for Grand Larceny</p>
<p>Mr<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. Powell is a high toned <hi rend="underline">Christian</hi> <hi rend="underline">lady</hi> with a small infant, and has clung to her husband with marked fidelity &amp; affection-</p>
<p>The evidence in the case was mostly circumstantial as to guilty intent. He was in very bad health, and mind impaired at the time, as the evidence and circumstances comenced to show_ Had he obtained a continuance, he would in my opinion, have been acquitted_ The sympathies of the whole community are with him, and the jury and Comwlths atty, informed me, that they would cheerfully sign a petition to you for his release_ It would be gratifying indeed, that he be discharged from confinement</p>
<p>Very truly
<lb/>Yours <hi rend="underline">John Q. A. King</hi></p>
