   <p>Hon Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E. Bramlett
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Your petitioners would most respectfully represent that there is now confined in the penitentiary house of this state one John Young who was sent there under about the following circumstances. Said Young having served a term of three and one half years in the Federal Army was discharged, and then went into the state service, and one day meeting on the streets, in the city of Covington - with a person whom he thought to be a lady, and who was carrying a heavy bundle, did without suspicion of wrong, tender his services to assist her in carrying the same, and while in this- as he honestly thought- commendable action- the two were arrested for having in possession stolen goods, and after trial said Young was sentenced to two years imprisonment in penitentiary where he has been confined for about one year</p>
<p>Now in consideration of the fact that said John Young was for so long a time a g<hi rend="underline">alla</hi>nt and faithful soldier, and the circumstances under which he was confined we respectfully ask the interposition of the Executive clemency in his behalf</p>
<p>Very Respectfully &amp;c 
<lb/>E. C. Baker
<lb/>Lat Cpt of said Jno Young
