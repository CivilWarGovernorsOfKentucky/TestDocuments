<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>Thos. E. Bramlett
<lb/>Dear Governor</p>
<p>This will Introduce to you M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Jno R. Warnock of this city -- who goes to see you in regard to a fine -- which he will explain to you in person -- I have ^known^ Warnock for many years and he is a particular friend of mine -- I trust you will find it consistent with duty to remit the fine -- Mr W. is not a man of any large means and has a large family dipinding upon him for a support who need his money much more than the state of Ky and I am quite sure that if you only knew Warnock<pb/>
<lb/>as I do that you would grant his request at once and trust you will any way &amp; if any body says you have done wrong charge it to me -- </p>
<p>yours truly
<lb/>Zeb Ward</p>
