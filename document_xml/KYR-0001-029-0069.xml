   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>James F Robinson:
<lb/>Sir.</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Covington Ky -- beg leave reaspectfully to present the case of Lafayette Brafford for Executive Clemency. We believe the facts of his case are well set out on the paper signed by the Jury that tried him, and for the reasons set out in said paper and the further reason that Mullins who was convicted for the same offense, was pardoned out many months since, we think even handed justice reqires the release of Brafford. This was his first offense. He had always been a well behaved young man -- supported his mother and the fact that no acquaintance existed between Brafford and the deceased -- and the manner of the deed, shows we think that the killing was an accident. We pray that he may be pardoned and as in duty bound will ever pray Cov Ky <date when="1862-10">Oct 1862</date></p>
