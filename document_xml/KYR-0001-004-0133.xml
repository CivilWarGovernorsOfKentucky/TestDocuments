   <p><orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Commonwealth</orgName><lb/>against } Affidavit of <persName ref="cwgk:N002008">Mrs Josephine Lynch
</persName><lb/><persName ref="cwgk:N002001">Caroline,</persName> a slave, charged with the murder of <persName ref="cwgk:N002006">Blanche child</persName> of <persName ref="cwgk:N00000995">Willis</persName> &amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N002005">Annie Levy</persName></p>
<p>Mrs Lynch states on oath that while at Mrs Levys she told Caroline to go to the Grocery &amp; buy some tea this was at the time that the child was a corpse &amp; the same time alluded to in Mrs <hi rend="str">Lynches</hi> Levys testimony before the court when Caroline was on trial. <persName ref="cwgk:N002007">My Husband</persName> had a dog killed by poison in Mr Willis Levys yard. My husband &amp; my self saw the dog while labouring under the effects of the poison &amp; told Mr Levy about it &amp; he said he poisoned it because the dog had anoyed him.</p>
<p>I found some poison in my yard thrown in by Mr Levy &amp; I remostrated with him &amp; told him that my children might get some of it I live next door to Mr Levy I am a sister to Mrs Annie Levy. Mr Willis Levy &amp; wife, I have heard the neighbors talk angrily about Mr Levy for killing their dogs in his yard with poison this I have heard a great many time.</p>
<p>I have been very uneasy many<pb/>
<lb/>time for fear that my children would get some of the poison I alwaise thought Mr Levy was very reckless about throwing out poison.</p>
<p>Mrs Levy told me that at the time the child died that she had in the house a water bucket full of parched coffee that was bought from the soldiers. My sister after the death of the child threw away the bucket of coffee</p>
<p>Mr Levy poisoned all the dogs of his close neighbors. This I know becaus the dogs died &amp; Mr Levy said he intended to kill them &amp; he put out the poison to do it He put out poison from fall to spring.</p>
<p>Mr Levy put out the poison every night for a great while I would think a hundred times</p>
