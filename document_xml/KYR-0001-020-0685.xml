<lb/>Governor Magoffin,
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I submitted to you the other day some appications of a few of my constituency asking to have divers &amp; Sundry fines remitted for playing games of marbles cards &amp;c for a "consideration" I regret that I today forgot to call your attention to them, I also gave you the petition of Mrs Clark asking for the remission of a forfeited Bond. The petition in that case explains itself and I feel satisfied when you read the petition that you will extend to her the clemency She asks and indeed is so<pb/>
<lb/>justly entitled to receive.</p>
<p>Enclosed I submit to you a Statement of 2 cases of the Comwhth Vs W H Smith the Judgments are small it is true only $20. each but they were both for small games &amp; Smith is a poor man -- a clever man and not a gambler although he sometimes indulges in a game of cards. If you can find it consistent with your duty to relieve these gentlemen you will place them &amp; myself under many obligations to you_</p>
<p>truly your friend
<lb/>W D Lannom<pb/></p>
<p>Hickman 
<lb/>E &amp; C Ct
<lb/>Two Judgts each of
<lb/>$20. W H Smith
<lb/>Respite 12 mo
<lb/>B. M</p>
<p>Two Judgments one of $350. the other of $10. against</p>
