  <body>
   <p>To his Excelency the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, </p>
<p>the undersigned petitioner<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> would respectfully represent that at the <gap/> term of the Johnson circuit court there was three Judgements rendered agains them (one against them Jointly &amp; the other two seperately,) on indictments found at a previous term, all of which was represented to your Excelency by petition immediatly after the rendition of said Judgements, largely signed by citizens &amp; the <hi rend="underline">bar</hi> &amp; recommended by the court &amp; com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> atty. in private letter, upon said petition they obtained a respite for six months which was laid away in the clerks office,</p>
<p>they charge that a great portion of the records &amp; documents of said office has been destroyed by the troops including said respite as they suppose, as it cannot now be found,<pb/>
<lb/>therefore cannot be filed herewith. they state that the respite is now very near out, at which time execution will issue &amp; be collected if not restrained by your exelency. they deem it unnecessary to state that they have no means (except a small portion of land <hi rend="str">(</hi>&amp; that without fense or dwelling) as your Excelency is no doubt always acquainted with the <hi rend="underline">terable</hi> havoc &amp; prostration on sunday consequent upon the march of troops to &amp; fro,</p>
<p>wherefore they ask your Excelency to take cognizance of their cases. &amp; grant them a final remit of said fines except the cost (which they think severe under the circumstances,) they make this a part of their original petition and ask for all the Clemency there sought, &amp; in duty <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> bound will ever ask &amp;c, </p>
<p>C. T. Wales
<lb/>Nath Preston,<pb/></p>
<p>We the undersigned Joine in the prayer of the above petitioner &amp; earnestly ask the relief sought for. </p>
