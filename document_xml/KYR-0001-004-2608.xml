   <p>His Excellency Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Madison County Kentucky respectfully represent that at the <date when="1865-06">June Term 1865</date> of the Madison Circuit Court William Simms was indicted for Maliciously assaulting and beating John Heathman "<hi rend="underline">with</hi> <hi rend="underline">Clubs</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">Pistols</hi>".</p>
<p>Said case was tried at the <date when="1865-09">September Tern 1865</date> of said Court and the Jury returned a Verdict of Six days imprisonment and a fine of $25 against said Simm<hi rend="sup">s</hi> -- </p>
<p>Your Petitioners represent that the Evidence on the trial was that Sims rode up to where Heathman was riding along the public road and charged Heathman with having treated him badly upon a former occasion -- Heathman at first denied it and afterwards substantially acknowledged it -- Words passed between them when the "<hi rend="underline">damn</hi> <hi rend="underline">lie</hi>" passed <hi rend="str">betwe</hi> several times, and Simms struck Heathman with his fist -- Heathman fell off, or jumped off, or was knocked off of his horse, the witnesses could not tell, &amp; drew up a rock or attempted to do so when Sim<hi rend="str">s</hi>ms drew his Postol, but made no effort to fire nor did not advance upon Heathman but told Heathman if he threw the rock at <hi rend="str">f</hi>him, he would shoot him or kill him.<pb/>
<lb/>No other blows passed between the parties and they soon parted -- </p>
<p>The only lick struck was the one by Simms with his fisst -- Heathman was not hurt but rode on and attended to his business as usual -- Simms did not attempt to use his <hi rend="underline">Postol</hi> or any <hi rend="underline">clubs</hi> &amp; only struck the one blow.</p>
<p>Simms has always been <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>a Union Man &amp; volunteered to fight John Morgan, &amp; Heathman has had the reputation of being a Rebel -- </p>
<p>As there was no injury ^done^ we think the verdict of the Jury was wrong &amp; excessive &amp; a great hardship upon Mr Simms -- </p>
<p>We earnestly pray your Excellency to remit said fine &amp; punishment &amp; relieve him from incarceration in a filthy County Jail -- very Resp'ly</p>
