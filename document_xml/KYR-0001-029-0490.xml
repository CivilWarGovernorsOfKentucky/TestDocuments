   <p>To the Governor of Kentucky. -- </p>
<p>Your petitioner Abraham Forst states that he was in the Market house in Louisville and was insulted by a man who called him a son of a bitch a darn liar and other outrageous epithets and the mans friends four or five in numbre gathered around your petitioner make such demonstrations as to induce him to think they meditated on attack upon him -- He states he went home and armed himself for protection only and shortly afterwards again met the man that insulted your petitioner with one or two of his friends around him and someone of them he could not tell which again insulted your petitioner and he drew out his pistol and defied them -- That he was indicted for carrying consealed weppons and fined $50. being unable to prove that he obtained the pistol for self defence. -- He states he is a poor man worth nothing with a wife and seven children to support none of the children being able to earn a support -- He prays your excellency to remit the fine otherwise he will have to pay it in the work house or greatly distress his family.</p>
<p>A. Forst<pb/></p>
<p>I have known Mr Forst for a long time he is a quiet peaceable citizen, is poor and has a large family to support -- And in these times when every mans life is constantly in danger I do not think the law carrying concealed weppons should be enforced. I hope the Governor will remit the fine -- </p>
<p>W. C. Wood</p>
<p>Mr Forst, the petitioner, is a very quiet and peaceable citizen. The General custom, now prevalent in the city of citizens, going armed and with much reason, I respectfully, Join with him in asking that his prayer be granted</p>
<p>W, G, Reasor, city atto</p>
<p>I know M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Forst &amp; concur with Mr Reasor that he is a very quiet orderly man &amp; good citizen</p>
