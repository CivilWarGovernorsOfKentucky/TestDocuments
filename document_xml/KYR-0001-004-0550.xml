   <p>State of Kentucky, Mason County, Sct.:</p>
<p>Your Petitioners, William Brookover and James Brookover. (his brother.) state that at the <date when="1856-10">October term of the Mason Circuit Court, 1856</date>, your Petitioner, Wm. Brookover, was tried by a jury, convicted and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment in the Kentucky Penitentiary, under an indictment for grand larceny.</p>
<p>They further state that said William, who was connected with a respectable family, and who had a wife and little boy then living, in order to avoid the infamy of confinement in the Penitentiary, broke the Jail of Mason County once escaped some weeks after the sentence was pronounced upon him. For about 4 years he concealed himself in remote parts of the country to avoid arrest and punishment. When the rebellion broke out he entered into the army of the United States as a private, and has ever since served his country faithfully, which they hope have in some degree atoned for the waywardness of lies youth. He has now served full three years.</p>
<p>They further state that he has contracted a disease in the Federal service which now confines him in a Federal Hospital at Pine Bluff, Arkansas, which they have reason to fear will prove fatal.</p>
<p>They state further that his wife (who has been divorced from him on account of said conviction) is now lying on her death bed near Maysville -- his little son is with her. He has not seen his family or been permited to return home for about 8 years.</p>
<p>He thinks his punishment has already been doubly severe, and humbly prays that Your Excellency will pardon him in consideration the facts above stated; and he will never cease to the grateful for this act of Executive mercy.</p>
<p>James. C. Brookover<pb/></p>
<p>State of Kentucky, Mason County, Sct:</p>
<p>Personally appeared James C. Brookover this <date when="1864-07-15">15th day of July, 1864</date>, and made oath that the facts herein stated are true.</p>

<p>They send a number of letters received from the applicant to show that he is in the Federal service, and also in the hospital. He signs his name John W. Brookover, but is the same person who was convicted as you can see from reading the letter.</p>
