<lb/>My dear Sir</p>
<p>Mr John O Ross a respectable citizen of Jefferson County had a little difficulty with a citizen of Louisville in which he struck a blow with his fist once, inflicting no injury of any consequence. He was indicted in the Police Court of Louisville and was fined fifty dollars -- He used no weapon and as I have stated no injury of any consequence was done. He has paid to the Man that of the Court thirty five dollars &amp; <hi rend="sup">25</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi>, the costs and the amount to which the atto for Commth is <unclear/> ^in the letter^ He now asks at your hands a remission of the remainder and if you should decline to grant it, he trusts you will give a respite. His affairs are<pb/>
<lb/>very much embarrassed and he feels himself unable to pay the balance of the execution at this time</p>
<p>I hope you will grant his request
<lb/>Very respy
<lb/>Yr obt servt
<lb/>Nat. Wolfe</p>
<p>His Excellency
<lb/>Gov: Robinson</p>
<p>P. S. The style of this case is Commth vs J O Ross. The execution is now in the hands of the Marshall. It is a capias pro fine<pb/></p>
