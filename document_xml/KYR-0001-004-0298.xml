<p>not giving the name of the officer who tried the case nor the County in which the offence was Commited.</p>
<p>The officer was Benjamin Wheler <hi rend="str">Esq</hi> Justice of the peace in &amp; for the County of Grayson &amp; state of Ky. The offence was commited in the County of Grayson &amp; Town of Millerstown I intended to have writen a letter for M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Howard but did not get to see him untill after the petition was gone -- as he Howard cannot write, I do not wish to influence the <hi rend="underline">Hon</hi> Governor to do anything but what I know or beleave would be rite, but in this case I do think he would do rite &amp; Justice to remit the fine, for Several reasons one is he ^Howard^ is a Loyl a citizen as their is in Ky whilst all Those engaged on the opposite side are as noted Rebels as their is in Ky -- Howard is a member of a home guard has sholdered his Musket by day &amp; Night to defend <hi rend="str">the</hi> his Neighbours, &amp; this &amp; other similar circumstances was the cause of the difficulty all the circumstances if necessary can be given I shall not attem^p^t it as I have not been requested to do so, I remain Yours</p>
