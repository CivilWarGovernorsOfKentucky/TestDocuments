   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>B Magoffin</p>
<p>The undersigned would respectfully represent that your Petitioner James Pilant on the <gap/> day of the <date when="1860-12">Dec<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> term of the Madison Circuit Court 1860</date> was Convicted by Conffession of Judgment of Keeping a Tipling House. He may have sold liquor contrary to law as much as twice He has been a licensed tavern Keeper for two years past. He sold this liquor after his license for the 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> year ran out and before he renewed for the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> year. He was under the impression that his license permitted him to sell for one month after the expiration of his license for the year when he intended to renew for the 2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> year. which was his intention &amp; which he did do. Upon inquiring of the County atty. he found he had done wrong which he deeply regrets. M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Pilant is a very poor man ^and an old man^ but one of the most honest in our whole county. He has a family to maintain and is ^in feeble health and^ is afflicted with a cancer on his mouth which will we greatly fear destroy his usefulness to his family in the future. We -- <pb/>
<lb/>earnestly recommend him to your excellency as a proper subject for the interposition of Executive Clemency.</p>
