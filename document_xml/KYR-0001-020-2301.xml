   <p>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Government of Kentucky,</p>
<p>The undersigned are citizens of Marion and Nelson Counties Ky. and neighbors of George Hall, who was for a time <unclear/> @ the time of the alledged commission of the offense herein after stated, depot agent at New Hope in the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Lebanon Branch. now six miles from New Haven -- that while there he was charged with keeping a Tipling house &amp; the grand jury of Nelson County at the <hi rend="str">Spring</hi> Term of the Nelson Circuit Court found a true bill against him -- ^&amp; he was convicted^ He was summoned to answer said charge at the Spring Term of said Court <date when="1862">1862</date>. We are informed &amp; have good reason to believe that he had a good a valid defense to said Indictment, that he was not guilty of the charge -- that he did not keep liquor for sale, but had some in his store, which he would not sell &amp; thusly incurred the displeasure of the parties who are believed to have set the prosecutions on foot and assisted in obtaining a verdict -- We also know that for weeks before the trial came on &amp; at the time said Hall was severly sick. even to unconciousness &amp; of course did not &amp; could not make known his case <hi rend="str">&amp; di</hi>d inform his friends that he had one pending -- His witness where he &amp; we believe are credible &amp; would have defeated the prosecution, were all absent in the army of the United States. Wherefore we would ask for our neighbor, as an act of simple Justice that his fine of $60. or that part of it going to the commonwealth remitted. &amp;c.<pb/></p>
