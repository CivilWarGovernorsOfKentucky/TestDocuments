<lb/>To His Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette,
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Ky.</p>
<p>We the undersigned jurors would most respectfully state to his Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky that we were impanneled and sworn on the <date when="--11-03">3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> day of November</date> to try a case of the Commonwealth against James Frazier a free man of color. Indicted ^in the Harrison Circuit Court^ for unlawfully coming into the state under the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Section of an act Approved <date when="1860-03-03">March 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> 1860</date>. The evidence was that in <date when="1862-09">September</date> ^&amp; <date when="1862-10">October^ 1862</date>, at the time this part of the state was occupied by the rebels, that many of the citizens left the county, some going to Covington some to Cincinnati. That the Deft. went to Covington, got employment about the Hotel, &amp; conducted himself with respect and propriety, that many of the citizens of the county were in Covington &amp; Cincinnati from the <date when="--09-01">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of September</date> to the <date when="--10-20">20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of October</date> and that they did not see him in Cincinnati once. One credible wit-<pb/>
<lb/>=ness testified that he saw him in Cincinnati once during that time &amp; only once, another heard him say in conversation that he had been in Cincinnati. It was also proved that he was free under the will of A. N. Frazier probated in <date when="1848">1848</date>. Under the law and facts we felt bound to find him guilty, Upon these facts we extended to him all the mercy the law would allow, and feeling that it is a case worthy of further mercy we would most respectfully recommend him to the mercy and clemency of the Executive.</p>
