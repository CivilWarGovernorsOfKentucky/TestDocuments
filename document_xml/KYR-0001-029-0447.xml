<lb/>To His Excellency James F Robertson.</p>
<p>Inclosed herewith is the petition of Doc. W. F. Robertson numerously signed by his neighbours praying the remission of a fine of $60. imposed by the Judge of the quarterly Court. I herd this evidence in the case and it was about as represented in the petition not stronger I am certain. I think it would be a very hard case for him to pay it. I am well acquainted with the Doctor &amp; know him to be a poor man and a cripple with a wife and several little children dependent on him for support, and owing to the general distress in this part of the country resulting from the ravages of armies the poor can scarcely live with their limited means apart from prosecution of this chracter, which are too often set on foot from motives other than that of enforcing the law and correcting morals I therefore hope your excellency will remit the fine</p>
<p>Your Obt Servt
