   <p>Maysville, Ky,
<lb/><date when="1864-09-05">Sep 5 1864</date>
<lb/>My dear Govenor,</p>
<p>I enclose you a petition of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> James C. Brookover, requesting the remission of a fine imposed upon him in the Mayor's Court of this City, for alleged resistance to an officer. The facts are correctly stated in the petition, and shew that he was improperly convicted, We would have gotten rid of it by appeal to the Circuit Court, but through the ignorance of Brookover, he replevied the fine, instead of giving bond and taking an appeal, as he was instructed to do. His counsel did not discover the error until after the time for taking an appeal had expired. The Mayor of the City, before whom the case<pb/>
<lb/>was tried by a jury unites in the application for a remission, and I trust you will find it consistent with your duty to grant the application,</p>
<p>With much respect,
<lb/>Your friend &amp;c
<lb/>R. H. Stanton</p>
<p>Hon Thos. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor &amp;c.</p>
  </body>
