   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramllette Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Elizabeth Millier would represent, that at the <gap/> Term of the Mercer Circuit Court, <date when="1862">1862</date>. one William H. Miller was tried upon an Indictment for carrying concealed deadly weapons, found guilty, and a fine of $80,, assessed against him. Also at the same Term of said Court, said W. H. Miller was tried upon an Indictment, for a tresspass, committed upon a Slave, the property of Doctor Abell, and fined the sum of $250,, -- Exectuions were issued upon both of said Judgments, in due time, and upon <date when="1862-07-15">15<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> July 1862</date>. both of said Executions, were replevied by H. C. Miller, deceased, lately the husband of your Petitioner, as Security in the Replevin Bonds. Said W. H. Miller has squandered the most of his property. Now the Commonwealth is seeking to collect the amount of said two Judgments, and Replevin Bonds, off of the Estate of her late husband greatly to her injury; She says it is true that her said husband was not present at, and nowise implicated in the Commission of either of said offences, and his estate ought not to pay the fine therefor. Wherefore she asks that said fines may be remitted. -- <pb/></p>
<p>Elizabeth Miller says, the statements of the foregoing Petition, she believes to be true.
