Anne Netherton a resident of Long Run in Jefferson County by remitting the penalty of One Hundred Dollars for which She is now, through that "Sympathy so common to woman," bound to the Commonwealth._ A black man named Peter who had formerly belonged to her and was still living with her had been arrested for marking a hog and claiming it as his- not his own. He was tried in an examining Court by esquires Conn and Hobbs found guilty ^of Felony^ and held in a bond of One Hundred Dollars for his appearance M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi>.
