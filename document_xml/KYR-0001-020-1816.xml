   <p>To his Excellency B. Magoffin 
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky </p>
<p>The petitioner William McClanahan repectfully represents to your Excellency, that in the summer of <date when="1862">1862</date> Robert H. Shepperd came home from the South, where he has resided for some years. While in Mason County, he became intoxicated in Company with a party of young men, and was charged with passing two Counterfeit half dollars. was taken up and tried by the mayor of the City of Maysville, and placed in jail in default of <hi rend="underline">Three Hundred dollars bail.</hi> after he was placed in jail, and became sober he stated that he knew nothing of having or knowing any conterfeit coin, that if he had done so, he knew nothing about it, and had received the coin when drunk. He was in jail, his family consisting of his wife and two daughters, were neighbors of mine. He had worked with and for me and had resided in my family, a liberal and naturally a kind hearted man himself. I yielded to the importunities of his wife and became his bondsman. He promised to return I am informed that the would have done so but he while on a spree, got beyond the lines of the two armies and could not<pb/>
<lb/>get back The grand jury indicted him in <date when="1861-10">October 1861</date> and the Attorney for the State filed the indictment away in <date when="1862-04">April</date> His recognizance was forfeited and judg<hi rend="sup">t</hi> given against me for Three Hundred dollars and the costs as his bondsman, To pay this sum will amost ruin me at this time I therefore petition your Excellency to remit so much of the judgment against me an your Excellency has power to remit</p>
<p>William M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Lanahan</p>
<p>The Undersigned know William M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>CLanahan and are familiar with the facts of his Case. We join him in his petition and request Gov Magoffin to release him from the payment of the judgment against him <date when="1862-04-22">April 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 1862</date></p>

<p>I knew W Shepard and I am well acquainted with Mr. William M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Clannahan</p>
<p>I have no doubt Mr. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Clannahan became the bail of Shepard from the best of motives, the payment of the bail will be oppresive to M. McClannahan and that it will be proper to remit a large portion of the judgment</p>
<p>Francis T. Hord</p>
<p>I know nothing of the facts of this case or of the party against whom the recognizance was forfeited, but I know Mr McClannahn to be a gentleman, &amp; have no doubt his representations of the facts are true, &amp; that he ought to be relieved by the interposition of executive clemency </p>
