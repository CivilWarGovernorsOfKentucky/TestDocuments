Alley, got into a frolic, in the city of Frankfort, ^on the <date when="1865-02-25">25th February</date>^ and as proved, on the trial did some loud talking, disturbing, the quiet of the city and furthermore, drew and brandished a pistol, for which he was arrested, and tried before the Police Judge of Frankfort and fined the sum of Five dollars for a breach of the Peace and disorderly conduct, and the further sum of Fifty Dollars for carrying a concealed weapon, Your petitioner says his son has no seperate estate, out of which to pay the fine assessed and that he is himself illey able to spare the amount from the support and maintance of his family, and therefore he respectfully ask. Your Excellency to remit said fine, It being almost impossible in these times of excitement to keep weapons out of the hands of Young and thoughtless boys, He respectfully solicits and prays. Your Excellency to remit the fine aforesaid and he will forever pray &amp;c.</p>
