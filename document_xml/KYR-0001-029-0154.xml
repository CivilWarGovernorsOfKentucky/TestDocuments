  <body>
   <p>To His Excellency James F Robbertson
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner J M Doty of Barren County and state of Kentucky, would represent that at a late term of the Barren Criminal Court he was indicted for an offence known in the laws of the State as "usurpation of office" charging that he usurped the office of Judge of the Barren County court. Now your petitioner begs leave to make to your Excellency a candid and truthful confession of the whole matter, together with the reasons and motions which impelled him in the premises.</p>
<p>Your Excellency is aware that this portion of the State for nearly six months received no protection from either the general or state Governments -- but suffered it to be occupied by a large body of armed men from the South terribly hostile to both. Disloyalty, or suspected disloyalty to <hi rend="underline">their</hi> <hi rend="underline">cause</hi> was in many instances punished by confiscation and imprisonment by no higher tribunal than that instituted by a semisavage and brutal soldiery on the occasion. During this time a pretended government was set up for the State and your petitioner was appoiinted to the office aforesaid without any previous consultation with him on the subject. He states that he was averse to accepting it at first, but his friends, or those who should have been such urged him to do so, first by arguments and others by insinuating threats, which were well calculated to have swayed abler minds than his and he yealded, but was never commissioned or sworn by the pretended authority to confer<pb/>
<lb/>the office. Clark the man who was sent out to appoint officers for the so called provisional government he never saw or heard of before Petitioner lives six miles from town, was not in town when Clark was there. Clark left a written order making the appointment in town which petitioner did not see till some two weeks after its date. Petitioner never held a court and never would have shown said order, but Judge N O Ferran who had issued a process in a case then pending in said court was about to be arrested for doing so by a military force. When petitioner learned it, he in order to prevent the Judge from arrest informed said authority that he presumed the Judge had no notice of the order. When he was directed to send said order to him which he did and thereby saved both from arrest. Your petitioner cherishes no hostility to the Government of his fathers, or the contrary where its authority has been restored he voluntarily went to Louisville on on the <date when="--07-04">4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of July</date> last and took the oath of allegiance in good faith which he has since tenaciously observed. Your petitioner states that he has a family dependant upon him for support. That he is not able <hi rend="str">to incur the expense of the</hi> to pay the fine which the statute imposes and that the assessment of it would reduce him and his family to beggery and want. He states the existence of the prosecution gives his family and himself great uneasiness of mind. the idea to his mind of being indicted for an offence against the laws of his country is appalling in the extreme, and the expense of defending said prosecution will be exceedingly burdensome to your petitioner<pb/>
<lb/>Your petitioner would therefore make this appeal to executive clemency for pardon of the offence being the first in his life against the authority of the state which gave him birth</p>

<lb/>Barren County</p>
<p>This day James M. Doty came <hi rend="str">to see</hi> before me and made oath that the foregoing petition signed by him is true</p>

<lb/>Gov Robinson</p>
<p>I have no doubt of the correctness of <unclear/> of within petition. I know the petitioner well -- he is a distant relative &amp; I know he is a good citizens, honorable and <unclear>quiet</unclear>. I believe his case is one of merit and I recommend him to clemency. Gov Owsley and I believe others are such <unclear/>, active before and victorious -- I recommend Jas M Doty to favorable consideration -- </p>
