<lb/>His Excellency</p>
<p>Governor Bramlette, I understand my old friend &amp; acquaintance, F. Gorin Esq of Louisville Ky is indicted for <hi rend="underline">maliciously</hi> shooting a Mr Wood. I know Mr Gorin better than any man in Louisville. I have practiced law with ^him^ long long years, ever since we were young men untile he went to Louisville &amp; we are both now getting old. <hi rend="str">Mr Gorin.</hi> I beg leave to express to you my sympathy &amp; regret at this event. This trial &amp; visitation to Mr Gorin so painful in his old age: Tho, still vigorous in mental power, &amp; noble &amp; generous in his feelings principles &amp; conduct! It is not<pb/>
<lb/>in Mr Gorin's nature or character to do a <hi rend="underline">malicious</hi>, unprovoked ignoble deed. He may occassionally be impetuous as I am and all of us are; but his long life in a prominent &amp; public capacity is strong, <hi rend="underline">conclusive</hi> evidence; that the charge of so low &amp; cowardly a crime cannot be true of Mr Gorin He could not be guilty of <hi rend="underline">malicious shooting</hi>. The facts are familiar to his Louisville friends. I speak of his character, the absence of all charges against him during a long public life: and I should regret most deeply the necessity of Mr Gorin being required, in view of the whole subject, to submit to a trial in open court as at ^all^ necessary to public justice or policy.<pb/>
<lb/>You will therefore permit me, (tho not fully acquainted ^with you^,) to request <hi rend="str">you</hi> <hi rend="str">Mr</hi> petition your Excellency in the exercise of the high perogative you hold under the constitution, to remit the charge in the indictment &amp; pardon Mr Gorin of the supposed offence with with he stands charged. Glorious are the ministration of mercy in righteous! In this country, in eight or ten counties, Mr Gorin has many familiar kind friends, they would rejoice at the interposition of the Executive, and to this end we invoke your most serious kind consideration! I am in all good will &amp; kindness</p>
<p>Most respecty your friend
<lb/>H. Grider</p>
