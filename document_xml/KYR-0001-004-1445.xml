<p>Govenor Thomas E Bramlett
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>A Bench warrant was issued in the county of Grant against James Adams of Scott and placed in the hands of the Sheriff of Said county &amp; he arrested James Adams of said county who proved to be the wrong man, another man of the same name having Committed the larceny.</p>
<p>Adams being under arrest was compelled to give bond for his appearance in Court, ^with Thomas H Moody his surety^ but the sheriff afterwards became satisfied that he had arrested the wrong man, and promised to have the bond quashed, consequently Adams and his surety failed to attend and judgement went against them by default for five hundred dollars, a sum which neither party is able to pay.</p>
<p>It is clearly a case fully warranting your executive clemency.</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Milton Stevenson<pb/></p>
