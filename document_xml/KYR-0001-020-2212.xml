<p>I was present at the present term of the Rowan Circuit Court &amp; heard the cause of the commonwealth vs H. G. Burns called -- which he was fined for carrying consealed a Deadly weapon -- the facts are that his servant a man of coller had heard an individual say that if H. B. Burns came to the clerk office to attend to the business of a client that he would whip him &amp; Burns armed himself for the moment &amp; when he<pb/>
<lb/>went to the office he was attacked &amp; his weapon protected him this is a true history of the circumstances as I <unclear>found</unclear> them at the calling of the cause for trial H G Burns confess Judgment that he could not introduce his servant I think it is a case that would justify a remission of the fine</p>
