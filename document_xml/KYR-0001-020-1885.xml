   <p>To His Excellency Beriah Magoffin, Governor of Kentucky </p>
<p>Your petitioners, Robert G Carlisle and George T Keith would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1862-03">March term of the Jessamine Cicuit Court 1862</date>, they were each fined fifty dollars and costs and the trial of an indictment against them for selling liquor to minors -- </p>
<p>They state that at the time the offence is charged as being committed by them, they were carrying on business in the town of Nicholasville in the firm name of Carlisle &amp; Keith -- </p>
<p>That on the trial the Commonwealth proved, theri clerk, in <hi rend="underline">their absence</hi>, sold liquor to two minors, who had no lawful authority to buy and under the instructions of the court they were fined as stated above -- </p>
<p>Your petitioners state and declare that said sales were made by their clerk without their knowledge, consent or approbation and that they knew nothing of them until the proof was adduced in court at the trial -- That their said clerk left the state several months before the trial and they have no means of redress against him -- </p>
<p>They would represent to your Excellency that said fine is hard and oppressive and although they may be guilty in the eites of the law still they are morrally innocent -- </p>
<p>Wherefore they pray your Excellency to remit said fines as far as may lie in your favor or as your descretion may decree proper -- </p>
<p>Robert G. Carlisle 
<lb/>George T. Keith<pb/></p>
<p>The undersigned Jurors in the foregoing, named case believe all the statements of the petitioners to be true and we unite with them in asking his Excellency to remit said fines -- </p>
