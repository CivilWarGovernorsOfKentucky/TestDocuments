   <p>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned your petitioner would respectfully represent that at the last <date when="1860-09">Septembe</date> Term of the Knox Circuit Court a fine of five dollars was assessed against him for an assault. He states that at the time said offense was committed he did not intend to willfully violate or disregard the laws of the land but was greatly provoked by the Indecent and abusive language of a man in the presence of his family and in a moment of excitement struck the offender thinking he richly deserved the castigation he gave him, He states that in addition to said fine the costs amounting to $<gap/> was adjudged against him and the sheriff has now in his hands a writ of execution against him for said fine &amp; costs.</p>
<p>He states that although he is poor and ill able to pay the aforesaid fine he would not if times were as flourisihing as they have been trouble your excellency about so small a fine but at a time like this when depression ^&amp; hart times are^ fell in every department of business through out the whole country and have especially visited this portion of the country it will greatly embarrass and distress him to pay the costs in this case without the fine He therefore asks your excellency in view of the premises to remit said fine and relieve his embarrasments.</p>
