<lb/>Goveror of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner James Jewell states that he was indicted by a grand Jury of Woodford County for suffering and permitting games of chance, hazard, and cards upon which money &amp;c was bet, won, and lost, in a house in Versailles in his possession and under his controle.</p>
<p>He states that he is a Keeper of a salloon in said town of Versailles, and that the charge in the indictment that games of hazard were played in his house for property was true. because cigars and whiskey were played for, won and lost</p>
<p>After the indictment was found against him he learned from his counsel that permitting even a cigar or drink of whiskey to be played for was a violation of law and made him subject to the fine imposed by the Statute. Knowing it to be true that such things had been. bet, won, and lost, in his house and after finding the <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>Commission of such <hi rend="str">things</hi>acts to be unlawful. and <hi rend="str">not</hi> not wishing to deny a charge that was true, he, at the <date when="1865-10">Oct Term 1865</date> of the Woodford Circuit Court, confessed<pb/>
<lb/>Judgment and Judgment was rendered against him for $200.</p>
<p>Petitioner has given your excellency a history of the case and believes he is Justified in asking clemency at your hands. He therefore prays that you will remit so much of said fine ^as^ you can</p>
<p>J, K, Jewell</p>
