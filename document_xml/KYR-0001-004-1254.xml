<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of The Commonwealth of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>The undersigned would most respectfully request your Excy. to pardon James Pettitt now confined in the Penetentiary of the Commonwealth -- </p>
<p>James Pettitt was <hi rend="str">some</hi> indicted in the Jefferson Circuit Court on the charge of killing his wife. He was tried for <hi rend="underline">Murder</hi>. A coroner's Inquest had been held in this case, <hi rend="underline">when</hi> the body was found. That Jury concluded that the woman died from <hi rend="underline">inebriety</hi>. And the Jury was held in the grave-yard, and a post-mortem examination, was had, and <hi rend="underline">that Jury</hi> concluded that the death resulted from wounds inflicted by her husband James Pettitt. On the final Trial the Jury convicted him of manslaughter and fixed his punishment at <hi rend="underline">Five</hi> years in the State's Prison. Now, in our minds there is much doubt as to his guilt -- And that<pb/>
<lb/>being the case we feel it our duty to ask your Excellency to pardon him -- He was at all times previous to this charge an <hi rend="underline">honest</hi> and <hi rend="underline">industrious</hi> man -- a timid and peaceable man; and we did believe him incapable and do now believe<hi rend="str">ing</hi> him incapable of meditating and committing Murder or compassing the death of anyone -- His ^wife^ was very intemperate and may have brought about her death by drunkenness -- "<hi rend="underline">Who</hi> <hi rend="underline">hath</hi> <hi rend="underline">wounds</hi> <hi rend="underline">without</hi> <hi rend="underline">cause</hi>"? The wise man puts this question and gives us the answer -- "They that tarry long at the wine" -- </p>
<p>Believing then that James Pettitt is innocent of crime we the undersigned Pray your Excy. to pardon him -- </p>
