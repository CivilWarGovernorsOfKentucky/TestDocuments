   <p>To His Excellency, the Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of Kentucky.</p>
<p>We, the undersigned, respectfully petition your Excellency to pardon William Porter, found guilty of horse stealing, upon his own confession at the present Term of the Lewis Circuit Court, for the following reasons, viz:</p>
<p>His youth &amp; inexperience in <unclear/> our Compassion then we learn that the rebels had plundered his father, brother &amp; brotherinlaw of their horses, bed clothes &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi> &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi> &amp; driven him from home, because he had served as a home guard in the exposed County of Carter where he lived; and that while on his way to Catlettsburg to volunteer in the U. S. Army, he fell in with two returned Soldiers of the 22<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> Ky. Vol<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> &amp; in Company with them, was induced to <hi rend="underline">retaliate</hi> by taking ^three^ horses from two citizens of Lewis, who were pointed out to them as rebels -- We believe the public interests will be best served by pardoning the young man &amp; allowing him to volunteer. We also pray Y<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Excellency to pardon Samuel Johnson, one of the young men engaged with Porter in this reprehensible affair. He is a soldier of the 22<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> Ky. at home on furlough, who while in liquor was also set on to <hi rend="underline">retaliate</hi> upon these so called rebels We think he can best <hi rend="underline">serve</hi> the state by being sent to his<pb/>
<lb/>Regiment &amp; hope y<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Excellency will so order it So much leniency has been shown rebel horse stealers ^by the Government^ we hope it may please your Excellency in these cases to listen to the recommendation of the jury to humble petition.</p>
<p>Respectfully.
