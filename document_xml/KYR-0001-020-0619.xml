<lb/>Gov Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A the present term of the Equity &amp; Criminal Court for this (Graves) County, a Judgment was rendered against myself and Wiley Morris in favor of the Comth. We were the securities of one Mr Boyd who was indicted for a Breach of the Peace. He has removed from the Comth and we will be forced to pay the amount unless your Excellency will interpose in our behalf. It was in fact a very small affair, no fighting, nothing ^but^ loud talk while he was drunk. It would a pretty hard case for us to pay this amount, at this time, and if your Excellency can find it consistent with your views of duty to relieve us, it would be a God send to us just at this time. Thos H Corbett. atty for the Comth for this District has voluntarily given me the enclosed letter, I could procure many others if I thought it necessary, but presumme that in a matter of Duty, petitions amount to but little especially in a case like this.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Your obt Servt</p>
<p>W M Cargill<pb/></p>
