<lb/>Hon B Magoffin
<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir,</p>
<p>A Pettion of the citizens of our town in behalf of a free man of color by the name of Georg Long, ^will be forwarded you by this mail^ I have been requested by the former owners of Georg to tell you what I think of the case,</p>
<p>1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> I have known the Boy for 15 years &amp; with probably one exception he is the best behaved boy I have ever Known, 2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">n</hi></hi>d The prosecution I am satisfied is a metitious one, I heard the trial (but was not his Counsel,) I am satisfied that the witness said more than he Should have said, The Verdict is a hard one, &amp; in my opinion should you feel Justified in granting the relief praid in the petition, it will meet the wishes of our entire community, with the single exception<pb/>
<lb/>of the witness alluded to whom in my opinion is not, nor never has, been half so good a Citizen as Georg, (the petitioner), It is not often that we find a good free negrow &amp; I think where we have one we should treat <hi rend="str">them</hi> him with humanity &amp; give him full Justice I am truly sorry to hear of your misfortune in getting burnt &amp; hope before this you are convalesent,</p>
<p>Political matters are quiet</p>
<p>Truly your fr<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
<lb/>S, M, Bernard</p>
