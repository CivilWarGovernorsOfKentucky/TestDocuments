   <p>Louisville, <date when="1865-10-04">4 oct. 1865</date>.
<lb/>To the Gov of Kentucky,
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I have received the inclosed petition for a pardon sent me in a letter from Texas by Humphrey Marshal, with a request that I should see you personally and procure your endorsement of approval, or disapproval.</p>
<p>I cannot now got to Frankfort, nor do I suppose there is any necessity for me to go. I suppose he wished me to lay before you the substance of his very long letter in which he pleads most earnestly, and says he will be a good citizen. I think he has behaved very badly; but still I think it is probable it would ^not^ do any harm to let him go. He is indicted here for treason, along with many others.</p>
<p>Please send the paper to me, or let me know that you have had it sent to the President.</p>
<p>very respectfully.
<lb/>Henry Pirtle<pb/></p>
<p>Gov. Bramlette,
<lb/>Frankfort,
<lb/>Ky.</p>
