   <p>To his excellency the Govenor of Kentucky Your petitioner John Webb states that at the <date when="1859-04">Apl. Term 1859.</date> of the Russell circuit court he was tried upon an indictment for a breach of his tavern bond, which he had executed as required by law upon obtaining license to keep a tavern in Russell county He states that he was convicted &amp; fined $<hi rend="str">2</hi>300 upon the proof that liquor had been furnished by his wife at his house to a person already intoxicated. They your petitioner at the time did not know or believe to be any violation of law haveing often seen drinking men buy &amp; drink liquor at tavern bars, nor did his wife have any such Idea at the time she furnished the liquor. The same things are frequently done with impunity by persons who know the law, &amp; as your petitioner was both ignorant of the law &amp; also of the fact that his wife furnished the liquor he prays your excellency to interpose your clemency and to exercise your pardoning power under the constitution to relieve your petitioner from this fine as far as you have the right. He is a poor man with a large family</p>

<p>In this case, I am satisfied that Webb was the victim of others. he seemed at the time to have lost all power to control some members of his family who took entire control, Webb has since become comparitively a sober man, has quit keeping <unclear>Tavern</unclear> &amp; now conducts himself &amp; affairs, well enough I have no objection to a <hi rend="str">I</hi> release.</p>
