   <p>Louisville <date when="1861-04-02">April 2/61.</date>
<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>I Sincerely thank you for your letter congratulating me on my election. I should have replied sooner had I not expected to see you and thank you in person for your letter, and also for aid which I have reason to believe you gave me pending the contest -- which as well as your uniform kindness, -- despite differences of opinion &amp; action upon questions of great interest<pb/>
<lb/>to us both -- I trust I shall always properly appreciate.</p>
<p>By the bye -- Collin I. Throckmorton was in my office the other day, and told me that when you were a candidate for Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> you spent a night at his house, and he promised to vote for you, though he had never voted for a Democrat before, and that you promised him an office -- He says he voted for you but has rec<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> no office, I undertook to remind you of your promise -- I think Collin would<pb/>
<lb/>like to be called <hi rend="underline">Colonel</hi>.</p>
<p>If the returns are all in I should like to have my commission at once, as there is a <hi rend="underline">per diem</hi> attached which I ought to be getting to make up for loss of fees, as I can't undertake new suits. If they are not all in please give me names of the delinquient counties so that I may have it attended to.</p>
<p>yours truly
<lb/>J. F. Bullitt</p>
<p>Gov Magoffin
<lb/>Frankfort.<pb/></p>
<p>Sec will make out commission for Colin Throckmorton (and) and answer this letter without delay</p>
<p>B. M</p>
<p>Aid
<lb/>Com<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Iss<hi rend="sup">d</hi> <date when="1861-04-02">Apr. 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 1861</date></p>
