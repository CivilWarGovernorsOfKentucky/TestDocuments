   <p>To his Excellency Jas F Robins^on^ Govenor of Ky Your petitioners would respectfully represent that Robert H. Rankin of this county was fined at the last term of the circuit court for selling whiskey without license and at the time of trial was sick and unable to attend to the defense of the case which if he could have done the result of the trial would probably have been different as set forth in the annexed affidavit as Mr. Rankin is a good citizen we hope your honor will remit the fine</p>
