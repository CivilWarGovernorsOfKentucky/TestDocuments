<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I notice that blank forms are being printed for use of State &amp; Home Guards. We have formed Several companies of Home Guards in this county &amp; want arms. Will you be kind enough to foward me the blanks. I have been elected Captain of Muhlenberg Home Guards No 1 and have about 90 men in my company. We have taken the oath required by law, &amp; will leave certificate of <hi rend="str">Presiding</hi> Judge of county. All of which will be forwarded in a few days. Would be pleased to receive some instruction from you, as to mode of application &amp;c.</p>
<p>Yours Respectfully
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Edw</hi><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi><hi rend="underline"> R Weir Sr.</hi></p>
<p>P S
<lb/>We will give a good Majority for Union candidate for Congress (Capt Jackson) though desperate efforts are being made to take our Union men off. I regard Jackson's election certain by a majority of two or three thousand.</p>
