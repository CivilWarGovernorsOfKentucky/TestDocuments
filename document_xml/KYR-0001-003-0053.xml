<lb/>Head Quarters 45th Reg.Ky. Mt<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> Inf.
<lb/>Mt Sterling Ky
<lb/><date when="1864-01-08">Jany 8th 1864</date>.
<lb/>To his Excellency T. J. Bramlette:
<lb/>Governor,</p>
<p>My motive for addressing a <hi rend="underline">private</hi> communication to you, will be understood and appreciated I trust, <hi rend="str">when understood</hi></p>
<p>Actuated by a sincere desire to promote the public interest, I have succeeded after much labor and expense, in partially organising and perfecting ready for Service, the 45th Regiment Ky. vols. It is not strange therefore I should feel more than an ordinary interest and pride, in its efficiency, and future Success; and as these will depend mainly, if not wholly upon the character of the officers in command, I desire to Say a few things upon that point, and in a way which shall not in the future, complicate either my personal or official relations with them, nor expose me to the charge of acting through selfish and interested motives.</p>
<p>I stated to you frankly on a former occasion, my opinion as to the incompetency, and unfitness of Major Nathan Brown to fill the position he now holds -- I presume that, under the circumstances, you were left no other alternative, than to Commission him -- The justness of that opinion is fully Confirmed by the affidavit accompanying this, and to which you are respectfully refered, with a request, that for the present any action in his case be defered</p>
<p>I be leave now to call you attention to the question, Who shall<pb/>
<lb/>be Colonel of the 45th Reg:? I have been informed that John Mason Brown holds a commission to that office -- Looking to the good of the service, I could not have chosen a more acceptable Commander, nor one who would be more likely than he, to reflect lustre upon our arms: but does not the constitution of Kentucky require that an election shall be held for Colonel, as in the case of a Major. If this be the case, what must follow, when you are informed that Col. Zigler, formerly of the 5th Virginia Cavalry, has followed the Regiment for a long time, and was this day, by a majority of the Regiment, as I have been informed, elected Colonel.</p>
<p>While I am not disposed to detract from Col. Zigler, anything he can justly claim, I must be permitted to say, that all hope of securing a well disciplined and useful Regiment, is to my mind at an end, should he be commissioned <hi rend="str">as</hi> its Commander -- His courage is indisputable,and his bearing honorable, but he certainly lacks the capacity of a commander, in all the essential elements of success.</p>
<p>I have now given you briefly, my view of the affairs of this Regiment and if it shall contribute in any degree to its future usefulness, my end will be accomplished; and I must be permitted to say in conclusion, that if the election of Col. Zigler shall be ratified by a commission, I will ask that my resignation be accepted, that I may escape the consequences of a failure, which I think must ensue.</p>
<p>Respectfully Your obt. Servant.
<lb/>L. M. Clark
<lb/>Lt Col Comd'g
