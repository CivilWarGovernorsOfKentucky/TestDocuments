   <p>To His Excellency B Magoffin Governor of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>This affiant Daniel Lewis states that on the <date when="1861-03-02">2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> day of this month</date> he was arrested and tried charged with committing a breach of the peace, and fined $18.00 and costs and eight days imprisonment in the county Jail -- </p>
<p>He states that the facts are these -- This affiant resides in this county, has a wife and an aged mother dependant upon his labor for their daily bread. He has been living in a house Joining his brothers house with only a passage between them. On the day he was charged with committing a breach of the peace his brothers wife had got angry at him about some trivial matter and as affiant was passing from his own house out through the passage she called to him and began abusing him, some words passed between them and she struck affiant with a shovel while he was still in the passage, before affiant had time to strike her after receiving the blow from the shovel he was caught by a brother of affiants, and affiant went out without ever striking her at all,</p>
<p>Affiant states that she then procured a warrant to be issued against him and had him prosecuted by the county atty for a breach of the peace. Affiant being very poor was not able to employ regular counsel to defend him, and he is satisfied great injustice was done him on the trial. Affiant being ignorant of law. and having no proper advisor -- </p>
<p>He states that he had no wish or intention to commit a breach of the peace by striking said woman or any one else. said woman is the wife of affiants brother and the difficulty and prosecution was the result of her spiteful<pb/>
<lb/>feelings towards him for which he had given her no sufficient provication,</p>
<p>Affiant being quite poor and his wife and mother being dependant upon his daily labor to verdict of the Jury under the circumstance is he thinks entirely wrong and is a great hardship upon him and injureous to his family</p>
<p>Wherefore he prays Your Excellency to remit said fine and imprisonment &amp;c -- </p>
<p>Daniel ^his X mark^ Lewis</p>
