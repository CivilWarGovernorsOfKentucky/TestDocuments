   <p>Pendleton County -- Kentucky <date when="1864-11-23">Nov. 23.<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> 1864</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Tho E Bramlett, Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of Ky.</p>
<p>The undersigned <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> Leroy Sheehon would respectfully represent: That he is a resident of the County aforesaid, a foreigner, and an Irishman by birth and little acquainted with the habits, and less with the laws and judicial proceedings of this his adopted country -- That he is poor and straitened, very much so, in his circumstances, with a family, a wife and three infant childen wholly dependent upon his daily manual labour, for support and maintenance, without, as yet, permanent home or abiding place -- </p>
<p>That in <date when="1864-03">March last,</date> a difference happened between his wife and neighbour, John Jacobs and which drew him into a neighbourhood quarrel with said Jacobs: That said Jacobs saw fit, in a heated moment, to take out a peace Warrant against him -- That upon the parties appearing before F F Wallace a justice of the peace, he entered into a recognizance, willingly, to keep the peace and to appear before the next ensuing <date when="1864-04">April Term</date> of the Pendleton Circuit Court, And after having entered into said recognisance of $40. and the parties being present, under the admonitions and advise of said justice, they, mutually settled their quarrel, and restored their former amicable relations of friendship and neighbourhood. And thereupon the justice informed them, distinctly, that the Warrant and recognisance would not be returned by the Circuit Court, and that the parties might return<pb/>
<lb/>home in peace -- Nevertheless the justice, for reasons unknown to him, returned the Warrant and recognisance to the Court, and he relying upon the information of the justice, that the whole matter was ended before the justice, did not attend the Circuit Court and the Court in his absence, for nonattendance ^thus produced^ forfeited the recognisance and at the <date when="1864-10">October term last,</date> a judgment in favour of the Commonwealth was entered against him for the $40 -- and the costs of the proceedings. Margaret March his surity, by reason of being a married woman at the time of execution as surity the recognisance was exchanged from liability -- The clemency of your Excellency is invoked and remission of the judgment is prayed for -- </p>
