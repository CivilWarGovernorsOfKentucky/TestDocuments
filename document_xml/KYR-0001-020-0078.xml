<lb/>His Excellency J F. Robinson
<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>Sometime Since Thomas B. Wadlington of this County was convicted of the crime of Murder and was sent to the penitentiary of our state for life.</p>
<p>Since his conviction certain facts have been developed touching the character of the two witnesses on whose evidence the conviction was had. Some twelve months since a large number of affidavits were forwarded to Gov. Magoffin by the neighbors of Wadlington, and the two witnesses, presenting such facts as I think ought to Justify Your Excellency in granting him a free pardon.</p>
<p>I learned after Gov M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Goffin had examined the affidavits refered to that he had expressed a determination to pardon him, and did pardon his son William who is now at home.</p>
<p>The affidavits are on file in the secretaries office, and I would respectfully ask Your attention to them at your earliest convenience.
<lb/> 
<lb/>I make this request from a conviction in my own mind that it would be only an act of simple Justice to pardon him. The Lord save our beloved country.</p>
<p>I have the Honour to be very Respty
