<lb/>Gov Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I went the Security of One John Padgett for his appearance at the Clinton C<hi rend="str">u</hi>ircuit Court at its <date when="--08">August</date> Term last to answer an Indictment for Horse Stealing bail $300. He Padgett lived a near neighbor to me and I Knew him well and that he had made a good Soldier in the first Ky Cavalry -- Through Sympathy for him and I did not like to see him got to jail (which it seemed he would have to do). I went his security under these Circumstances &amp; under a Solem. pledge from him that he would stand his trial. he Came home with me and went to work and in a short time secretly without my Knowledge he ? left for parts unknown. Had I had the least suspicion that he was going to leave I wuld have arrested him and delivered him to the jailer of Clinton County -- I sent you a petition stating the facts in regard to this matter and asking a remission of said bail bond -- but for fear s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> petiti<hi rend="str">g</hi>on has never reached you or wast burnt at the time your office was burned I have been as particular in setting forth the facts above. Will your excellency be pleased to remit said forfeited bond.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>E B Chapman<pb/></p>
<p>Gov. Tho E Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort
<lb/>Ky</p>
<p>I think the Request ought to be granted under the Circumstance</p>
<p>Yours Truly
<lb/>W T Jackman</p>
