<lb/>His Excellency Gov. Robinson</p>
<p>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir. I beg leave to call your attention to the condition of an unfortunate young man who I am informed is confined in your Penetentiary for an offence Committed in Louisville against the Laws of your State how or under what circumstances I am not advised -- his name is Alexander Johnston and he is my Son -- I feel humiliated and extremely mortified in Stating the fact -- If you are a Parent you will I am persuaded Sympythise with me in this deep affliction which has fallen upon me So unexpectedly -- He has been tenderly nurtured and brought up from early childhood according to the Strictest rules of Christian Morality, and when he left his fathers house some three years ago his charracter was without Stain or blemish, he had become a member of the Presbyterian Church and So far as I have knowledge was<pb/>
<lb/>consistant in his walk and moral bearing in all respects -- After his arrival in Louisville I frequently heard from ^him^ and kept up a correspondence always councelling and advising him as I always had done in all my former councils to be careful of his morals and habits -- and no time did I hear any thing derogatory to his morel charracter untill the news came of his arrest for crime &amp; <hi rend="str">was</hi> committed to prison, great indeed was my surprize and Mortification when it was announced to me that Such was the fact -- He was in the employ of M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> C. Duvall in Louisville -- and whom I am persuaded will testify to his former good charracter &amp; I trust well interest himself for his relief -- I have written him on his behalf to do something for him -- Would it be too much for me to ask the great favor to call at the prison and See and converse with him, it would enable you to judge better of him by Seeing him yourself it is a and afflicted Father, request who remembers it it was the Mission of a distinguished Philanthropist<pb/>
<lb/>to visit many prisons, and for these worthy Deeds a Howard name will live through all time -- a yet higher &amp; Holier one Said "when I was in Prison ye visited me" -- My Petition is that he may be considered by you a a proper Subject for the exercise of the Executive clemency in his behalf</p>
<p>With Sentiments of the highest respect and regard
<lb/>Very truly yours
<lb/><hi rend="underline">E. R. Johnston</hi></p>
