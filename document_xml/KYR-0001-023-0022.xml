<lb/>Gov. Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I have a favor to ask in behalf of a friend here. It is the appointment of Thos. D. Wright, Editor of the National Democrat, as one of your aids. He declined a Commission of the same kind from Gov. Powell because he thought there would never be any thing to do. But he now believes that in less than six months you may require the actual services of as many of your staff officers as could enter upon active duty<hi rend="str">s</hi> in which event he would like to belong to your staff, and would therefore accept a commission. He is<pb/>
<lb/>a firm friend of your administration and I have no doubt that you would have no cause to regret the appointment.</p>
<p>In justice to him I will say that he did not mention the subject to me but I did to him.</p>
<p>I am confined to my room by sickness and have been Ever since my return from Frankfort.</p>
<p>I have rec<hi rend="sup">d</hi> from Mr. Yancey a copy of his speech in the African Slave trade, delivered in the Alabama Convention the <date when="1860-10-18">18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Oct</date>. He takes ground against it, viewing it as a question of political Economy, contending that the states Composing the Confederacy will have as much slave labor as will be profitable, and<pb/>
<lb/>he therefore recommends the adoption of a provision in the Constitution prohibiting the introduction of Slaves as merchandize from any foreign source whatever. This will prevent Ky &amp; other slave states that refuse to join the Southern Confederacy from sending their slaves for sale.</p>
<p>From what I can learn since my return this County is largely for Convention. Mr. Wright will have an Editorial in this weeks paper, severely, but I think justly, Commenting on the proceedings of the recent session of the Legislature. Also a reply to Harvey's lamentations over the defeat of the Crittenden resolutions.</p>
<p>Yours truly
<lb/>James G. Leach<pb/></p>
<p>Aid<figure type="hr"/>
