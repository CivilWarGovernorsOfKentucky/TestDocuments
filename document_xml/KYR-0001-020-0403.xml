   <p>To his Excellency Beriah M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin
<lb/>Govenor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners Alfred M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Gill &amp; Bernard Smith doing business under the name and style of M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Gill &amp; Smith. Thos. J. Below &amp; M. Agin doing business under the style of Agin &amp; Below &amp; J. C. Meddley would respectfully state that they were at the <date when="--10">last October term</date> of the Union Circuit Court presented to the Grand Jury of Union County &amp; said Jury found a bill against each and all of them for selling intoxicating licquors to a certain miner -- George W. Berry. Now your petitioners state that said George W. Berry. although a miner is grown and has the appearance of an adult. Your petitioners Below &amp; Agin state that they Know said Berry &amp; that he is not of age and that they themselves never sold him or gave him any licquor at all after the late law regarding this subject took effect that if said Berry got any licquor from them he got it entirely without the consent or knowledge of these petitioners and these petitioners cannot say how he came to get the said licquor Your petitioners M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Gill &amp; Smith. state that they do not even Know said Berry and that neither of them Ever sold him any whiskey. but that their barkeeper one John Grant without the knowledge or consent of these petitioners not knowing perhaps that said Berry was a miner Judging from his appearance sold him the licquor once shortly after said law that your petitioners are law abiding men and that they do not infringe or break this law. Knowingly if at all<pb/>
<lb/>Your petitioner J. C. Meddly states that he never in his life sold said George Berry any intoxicating licquors at all that said Berry applied to a little son of Your petitioner who happened to be alone in the bar room and that the child -- about 12 years old Entirely ignorant of the law -- sold him a drink of licquor &amp; that your petitioner is obedient to said law and will not knowingly violate and that it would be a great hardship on these petitioners and injustice if they should have to pay a fine for these violations of said law specified as aforesaid Wherefore they humbly pray your Excellency to quash said inditements and release your petitioners there from assuming your Excellency that it would be an act of pure justice as well as clemency</p>
