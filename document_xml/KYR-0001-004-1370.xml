<lb/>Gov. Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the last term of the Barren Circuit Court an Indictment for "Hog stealing" was found and returned by the Grand Jury against E K. Owsley Esq -- from My long and intimate acquaintance with Mr. O, -- his character standing as a Gentleman of irreproachable integrity -- need not assure you that I was astounded at such an accusation; I have made enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the case. and am gratified to be able to state from reliable information, that the prosecution is Malicious and unfounded -- It might be that the same felling of Malevolence that set on foot the charge Might stimulate the parties to sustain it and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Owsley has thought proper to ask that the proceeding be stopped before trial and in that view of the case I cheerfully join with him in asking your Excellencys interposition in his behalf, I do this too the more willingly on account of his much esteemed relatives and family with whom I have mingled in closest ties of friendship from early boyhood. Hoping that your Excellency will favourably consider this application</p>
<p>I remain
<lb/>very Respt
<lb/>your friend &amp; obt
<lb/>servant
<lb/>T T Alexander</p>
