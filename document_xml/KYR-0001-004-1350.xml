   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thos. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Fallen would respectfully state, that at the <hi rend="str">October</hi> <date when="1864-09">^Sept^ Term of the Louisville City Court 1864.</date> he was convicted of a misdemeanor &amp; sentenced to six months imprisonment in the Jail of Jefferson County.</p>
<p>The misdemeanor charged was trying to facilitate the escape of a prisoner. Your petitioner will admit that the evidence had on the trial was sufficient to convict, but your Excellency knows that many times circumstances may indicate the guilt of an accused person &amp; he be innocent.</p>
<p>Your petitioner will say this much in his own defense, that he never intended to violate the law, that willingly he did not violate the law</p>
<p>Your petitioner lives in the state of Maryland, far away from home &amp; friends; an aged mother dependent upon him for surport<pb/>
<lb/>a mother whoes heart would be utterly crushed if the terrible tidings reached her that her son, her only son was confined in prison; sad indeed would be her fate, her hopes all dead, struck with a subtle doom, such as in one short night fell on all the first born of the land of Egypt. It would be hard if I were alone in the world; but O, how much more terrible it is when I reflect that my mother must beare the pain of my confinement; she the inhabitant of the lowly cabin, strugling with poverty, &amp; may be with disease; her son far away shut up in prison, no one to furnish sustanance to her feble body, none to smooth her sick bed.</p>
<p>Govenor it is a light thing to pardon me, no wrong has been done any one, no wrong was intended; pardon me &amp; I will ever feel greatful, I will never forget my sad dificulty, &amp; as long as I live I will adhear to the right, &amp; my dear mother will be spared the pain I have so feebly endeavored to depict,</p>
<p>Your expectant servant<pb/>
<lb/>William. Fallen</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of the ^city^ Louisville unite in the prayre of the petitioner &amp; respectfully ask that your Excellency grant him a Pardon</p>
<p>H J Billings
<lb/>Thos J. Frazier
<lb/>Geo. Jonas Interpreter C. C. of Louisville.
<lb/>Phil Tomppert J C, C, C, L,</p>
<p>I presided at the Trial of the case against the Petitioner, the act charged against him in the Indictment was fully proved to have been committed, but I am Inclined to think he did it when drunk &amp; under the persuasion of some bad men confined in the Prison. I think the punishment he has received is sufficient and I am well satisfied he will not offend in like manner again</p>
<p>Geo. W. Johnston.</p>
<p>being the assistant Jailer I was the principal prosecuting witness and Think under the circumstances that the petitioner has suffered enough for his offence and I Join in the prayer of the petitioner</p>
<p>Yours Truly H C Thomas</p>
<p>I concur with Mr Thomas
<lb/>W.G. Reason cty atto.<pb/>
