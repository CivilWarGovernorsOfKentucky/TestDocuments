<p>Enclos<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> We send you about ten affidavits, which are strong we have not time to get more to day, but will probably send more by tuesdays mail </p>
<p>Examine them carefully and present them to the Gov.</p>
<p>We understand, that many of the names on the remonstrance are boys under 21 years, many doubtful characters, and many out of the county, and most of them living remote, and Know little about the matter. with the aid of Machen you will be able to purge their list and show who are most reliable</p>
<p>There wil be further petitions from Hopkins soon, and perhaps a hundred more might be got in our county.</p>
<p>If any thing further is sugested as being necessary by the Gov. let us Know and we will do what is desired -- <pb/></p>
<p>Our frd<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> are ready to make any such fix for Town safety -- Let no effort be neglected there or here -- </p>
<p>Dick Whitingtons child and Edwards second son are both dead, and to be buried to day -- there is a good deal of sickness</p>
<p>All well with us.</p>
