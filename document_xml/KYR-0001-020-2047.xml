   <p>To His Excellency B. Magoffin Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>You petitioners would state to your excellency that at the <date when="1861-04">April Term 1861,</date> Allen S. Brownfield was fined by the Mason Circuit Court the sum of fifty dollars for carrying concealed a deadly weapon, This fine by your executive clemency was respited for twelve months, which time has now expired -- We are informed that there was a great many <unclear/> circumstances, such as would greatly induce to excuse Brownfield for the act for which he was fined, and call for the interposition of your clemency on his behalf. In addition to this Brownfield is a poor, laboring man, has been confined for many months ^by sickness^ has a family dependant upon him for support, and the payment of this fine now, would be a matter of services was to him, and would be depreiving his wife &amp; children of their means of support. We therefore pray your<pb/>
<lb/>Excellency, that said fine may be remitted, that the payment of the costs, will be an awful punishment, and indeed more than the said Brownfield is able to pay</p>
