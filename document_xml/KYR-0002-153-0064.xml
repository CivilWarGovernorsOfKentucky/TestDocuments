<lb/>Glasgow -- Ky.
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>Your favor to the Governor has been referred to his office.</p>
<p>Why you have heard nothing from the "Adjt. Generals Office" in regard to certain communications of your own, I cannot say -- they have always been duly noticed. Your communication -- of date <date when="1863-10-27">Oct. 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> ult</date> which you gave Capt. Letcher A. C. S to transmit -- reached last week, by mail from Louisville not having been mailed at all by you, as you intimate. It is the <unclear>purpose</unclear> of this Department to at once attend to all matters placed before <unclear/> -- without favoritism, as without neglect <unclear/> Appointments are made upon the recommendation of the commanding officer then on the ground <unclear/>-tion has been issued, as none has been felt, to notify, or neglect any communication from you, anymore than from any other officer. the Election was held before the Judge of the County Court of Barren, who certified to its correctness, and on that Certificate commissions were issued for the vacancies then in the co. (A).<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">303</note>
<lb/>The issue was made as is usual. But it is not intended to commission quasi rebels -- and on your statement that Richard Martin is such, his commission has been revoked.</p>
<p>You will therefore inform him of this action, as I have done.</p>
<p>In future, when you criticize the action of this Department -- remember that his Excellency the Governor, gives direction in every instance in which a commision is issued.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, Sir,
<lb/>Your obt serv't
