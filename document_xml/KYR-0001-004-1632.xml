   <p>His Excellency Governor Bramlette,</p>
<p>We the undersigned Citizens of Newport, Campbell County Kentucky, would most respectfully State. That at the late term of the Circuit Court held at Newport, B Amptman was tried and convicted of selling spiritous Liquors without License and fined ($60<hi rend="sup">00</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi>) Sixty Dollars, the following facts where proved on the trial. That the City of Newport, granted him a License for the purpose of Keeping a Coffee house in said City, and he paid the City Tax, and took a receipt for the State Tax from the City Clerk <unclear>In Sum</unclear>, there is no doubt Mr Amptman paid the City &amp; State Tax before he obtained his License he offered the receipt of the City Clerk for the State Tax <hi rend="str">but</hi>and relied upon it. The Court decided it could not be offered in evidence as the payment should have been made to the County Court clerk, it is a great hardship on Mr Amptman who is a poor crippled man, with a large family depending on him. He is a German thought &amp; beleived that the payment to and receipt of the City clerk was good &amp; sufficient and that custom here always has been to pay the state Tax to the clerk of the City. We therefore pray your Excellency to use the Executive clemency in this case of Amptmans. as we feel confident and well assured the public interest will not suffer thereby, and the cause of Justice will be subserved and your petitioners will ever pray.</p>
