<lb/>Your Excellenzy
<lb/>Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Bramlette,
<lb/>Respected Sir,</p>
<p>While on my way from Evansville Ind. to this city I concluded to stop over at Louisville, to try and sell or rather introduce Flint Glass Vials to the Drug Trade generally, there being to my knowledge no Manufacturer of that ware in the State of Kentucky; I succeeded in bringing it into favorable notice, selling 3 Bills in the course of my tour there. As I was leaving the city to take the Boat for Cincinnatti I was accosted and arrested by a policeman named Gallagher for selling goods by Sample without a license,<pb/>
<lb/>I went with him to the Mayors or City Clerks office where he issued an ordinance warrant, I obtained Bail Messrs Robinson &amp; Co of Louisville, standing bail and yesterday I answered the case and was fined $50 and costs; Judge Johnson stating to my attorney Mr Gazley that under the circumstances had he the power he would be more lenient towards me, and said my only remedy would be to petition you to remit the fine. Not knowing how to do so I have written the above statement of facts. The fine Judge Johnson inflicted was the lowest he could under the ordinance. Knowing that I did not wilfully break the law, and thinking that, that especial case ^or ordinance^ was<pb/>
<lb/>intended to bear on strictly peddling &amp; retailing cases I submit the above to your good judgement and subscribe myself Yours obediently</p>
<p>Geo. W. Stoeckel,
<lb/>Salesman for Fahnestock.
<lb/>Fortune &amp; Co.
<lb/>Flint Glass Vial Manufacturers.
<lb/>Pittsburgh.
<lb/>Pa.</p>
<p>P.S.
<lb/>I have often represented my house in all the other western States, who altho they have laws similar to yours, do not construe the law to mean manufacturers; who do not peddle, but I go around among generally regular customers, and are not in competition with manufacturers in such States.<pb/></p>
