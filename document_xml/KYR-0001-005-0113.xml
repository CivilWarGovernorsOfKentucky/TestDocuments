<lb/>Govenor Thos E Bramblett
<lb/>Frankfort Ky
<lb/>My Dear Sir</p>
<p>Mr James Warren of the County of Bath this day called upon me in regard to his Son -- Some time since -- from 6 to 12 months ago -- a man named <hi rend="underline">Davis</hi> was found murdered &amp; Robbed -- Wilkins Warren was accused of the Deed -- having left the county about that time -- Upon the Repersentation of some parties from Bath Co Your Excellency put out a Reward of $300 for the apprehension of Wilkins Warren -- The facts of the case are these -- Wilkins Warren -- had left the County of Bath 5 days before this man Davis, was found &amp; Davis from the proof had not been dead 2 days -- Warren was always a most <unclear>thurgh</unclear> Union man, &amp; that section of Bath almost unanimosly Rebel, &amp; they charged this upon Warren to prevent him returning -- he having left his home because of the war troubles &amp; hence this Reward -- Warren now wants to return &amp; surrender himself up to the Law &amp; have the charge investigated -- but neither he nor his Father also a thorough Union man &amp; perfect gentleman, want these Rebels to be gratified by having him apprehended under this Reward -- It is a matter of pride with them &amp; I thank God, they have this pride, for I know them well &amp; know also the people, Rebels, by<pb/>
<lb/>whom they are surrendered -- the men their neighbors in are some of the worse -- not that in which the Savior <unclear/> it -- are apprehending his return &amp; have their <unclear>watches</unclear> out, not only for the purpose of receiving the Reward of $300 but that they may boast one having caught him -- I am in possession of all the facts in this case -- am satisfied that Wilkins Warren is innocent -- </p>
<p>I writ to ask you to withdraw this offer of Reward by a Public Proclamation &amp; I will guaranty that Wilkins Warren return as soon as he can be delivered of the same &amp; render himself up to the Law -- He is now on a trip across the plains with a wagon Train -- but I can reach him &amp; he will return -- Please answer &amp; let me know what step you will take in the case</p>
<p>Respectfuly
<lb/>Samuel McKee</p>
