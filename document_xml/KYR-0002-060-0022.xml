<p>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> W. H. Shook has been ever since the <date when="1865-11-05">5<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> of November</date> engaged in the service of the state -- About this time, I found him with about one hundred (100) men at Smithland -- I ordered him with his men to move up to Caseyville, which he promptly did -- &amp; on the <date when="1864-11-12">12<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> of Nov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 1864</date>, we arrived at that point -- He immediately entered upon his work, that is to say, hunting &amp; driving out the Guerillas from that section of the country &amp; recruiting His work was very laborious -- no man in the state has done more good than he -- he drove out all the bands, that had infested that country for more than a year -- The Union people of the country who had been driven from their homes, have nearly all returned -- In the Raid of Lyon he did more than all the officers &amp; soldiers of the Federal army, tho' a whole &amp; full Brigade was sent after him -- </p>
<p>He killed twelve men, Captured about thirty men, thirty good horses &amp; quite a number of small arms -- &amp; saved the towns of his District -- He served notice on all<pb/>
<lb/>the drafted men of the District at the request of the Pro. Mar<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">ll</hi></hi> -- </p>
<p>He has recruited about four hundred men -- two companies have been mustered &amp; he now has another ready for muster -- One hundred &amp; two (102) men were taken from him, <hi rend="underline">by force</hi>, by Johnson &amp;co.</p>
<p>I do think he should be commissioned as Major, dated back to at least the <date when="1864-11-05">5<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> of November 1864</date> -- </p>
<p>I hope you will act upon his case to-day, when the Board meets -- </p>
