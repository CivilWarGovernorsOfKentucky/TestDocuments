   <p>Barren County Kentucky
<lb/><date when="1865-03-16">March 16. 1865</date>
<lb/>To His Excelency Thomas E Bramlette Governor of Ky -- </p>
<p>We would respectfully state that a day or two since we together with many others of our fellow citizens subscribed most cheerfully a petition to your excellency for the pardon of the youth Sidney Young charged with &amp; convicted of the crime of firing a house -- His case in our estimation is another ^proof^ of the validity of the argument so common with Temperance Lecturers that <hi rend="underline">a dram in Moderation</hi> is the fruitful source of drunkenness and its ill consequences Our neighbour John Young (the father of Sydney) is well known in the community although a poor man as a sober, honest, industrious civil, law abiding citizen. his three sons Benjamin F., Jn<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. W., &amp; Sydney were like him in character honest, industrious, and inoffensive -- The two first named joined the Federal army and died in the service Sydney the oldest surviviing son learns too late the evils arising from <hi rend="underline">a dram in Moderation</hi> as stated in the petition we cannot believe from our personal knowledge of the previous good character of the boy that the act would have been committed ^otherwise^ and respectfully repeat the solicitation for his pardon -- </p>
<p>G. W. Erwin
<lb/>J. W. Henderson</p>
<p>Gov. Bramlet, I am well acquainted ^with^ G. W. Erwin and J. W. Henderson they are citizens of this County and loyal men and two better citizens do not live than these men, for candor judgment &amp; truth,</p>
<p><date when="1865-03-17">March 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1865</date></p>
<p>W. F. Evans</p>
<p>I know nothing of the accused, but from what I can learn whisky was his downfall.</p>
