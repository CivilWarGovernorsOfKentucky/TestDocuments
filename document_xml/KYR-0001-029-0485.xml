<lb/>To Hon. James F. Robinson
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>Anticipating that in the course of a few days a petition would be presented to your Excellency to remit a fine of one hundred &amp; fifty dollars imposed by jury in the city court of Louisville on one Moses Block and his wife Fanny Block for assaulting and beating severely Henrietta Dinkelspiel in fact learning and knowing that a petition for the remission of said fine is at the time of this writing being industriousltriously circulated by sd Block for signatures I have taken the<pb/>
<lb/>liberty as attorney for the prosecution of addressing your Excellency and laying before you a brief outline of the facts in the case which statement vouched as I have procured it to be by the clerk of the court who heard the evidence and by others will I opine enable your Excellency to see that ^the^ ends of justice would be defeated by the granting of sd Block's petition</p>
<p>It was established by the evidence of 3 or 4 witnesses that Moses Block attacked and beat in a most inhuman manner Henrietta Dinkelspiel merely for drawing water from a cistern which they used in common in the yard of a house in which both families resided, he Block<pb/>
<lb/>asserting that she had taken more than her share of the water, and that after he had bruised her face and arms and breast in a most shocking manner he held her and called to his wife Fanny Block to beat her also which she did and that between them the said Henrietta was so severely beaten that she lay senseless for some time. The victim's husband was absent at the time and she was totally without a protector. A Jury of twelve men of the defendants selection have after a careful investigation judged the offense to be of a character so agravated as ^to^ demand the fine they have fixed<pb/>
<lb/>and it is impossible for the writer to see what good result would be obtained by disturbing their verdict</p>
<p>Most Respectfully
<lb/>Byron Bacon
<lb/>Atty at Law
