   <p>Pine Bluff, Ark. <date when="1864-02-04">Feb 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1864</date>
<lb/>Dear Sister</p>
<p>I hasten to drop you these few lines in answer to your very kind and welcome letter of <date when="--01-11">Jan 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> which has just came to hand this day. I was glad to receive your letter and to hear that you were well. I was Sorry to hear that James had been Sick but was glad to hear that he was getting better, I was also glad to hear that Nancy &amp; Jane, and their families were well, also to hear from Brother Asahel and family were well when you heard from them last. I was uneasy about Asahel as I had heard in <date when="--10">October</date> last that he had been hung by the Rebels; this I heard from a rebel Prisoner at Memphis; who Said he lived in Livingston County Missouri. from what I learn in your letter it must be false. I have no important News to write to you<pb/></p>
<p>My health is not good I have done no duty since <date when="--07">July last</date>; Here of late I have suffered mostly with my back and kidneys. I ^have^ taken a great deal of medicine for it, and Still taking more. I think I am getting better slowly. We were looking for another general fight here; all last month, but it is played out. I think we never will have another fight at Pine Bluff. On the <date when="---19">19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of last month</date> we had a pretty Smart fight with Shelby's Rebel cavalry fifteen mile South of here, at first the Rebels Showed considerable ^pluck^ but our cavalry under command of Colonel Clayton with two peices of Light artillery, Soon put them to flight. We fought them on the run for seven mile. the Rebels suffered considerably in killed and wounded, Our loss was one man killed, and three men wounded. It is reported here now, that the Rebel troops have all been ordered South, how true this is I cannot tell; It is generaly thought here that we<pb/>
<lb/>will advance South in the Spring Some again think that our Regiment will Start for Leavenworth to be mustered out of the Service. The river is rising very fast here now, and we are daily looking for the boats up from below. There are Some ten thousand bales cotton here for the boats ^to^ carry out, if they ever get here. By the way you Said George Was going to School in Benton. I thought he was in the Service how did he get out. Tell mother <hi rend="str">I</hi> that I will See her if we both live until I get out of the Service, if it is possible for me to do so, I am very anxious to hear what is done at Frankford. Give my love to Father Mother Brothers and Sisters write soon</p>
<p>I Remain your
<lb/>affectionate Brother
<lb/>John. W. Brookover</p>
