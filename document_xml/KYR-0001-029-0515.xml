On the trial a majority of the jury were in favor of his acquittal.<placeName ref="cwgk:P001001">Tennessee</placeName></p>
<p>In Jany last, Milton Young, who became Singleton's surety from mere kindness -- died, whilst on his way to , to attend the legislature, of which he was a member. a widow &amp; eleven children survive him, &amp; it will be a great hardship on them, if compelled to pay off this bond.<placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName></p>
