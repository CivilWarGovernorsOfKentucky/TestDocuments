   <p>Bowling Green, Ky., <date when="1861-02">February 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 61.</date>
<lb/>Hon. Beriah Magoffin, Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Sir. Mr. Alexander Morris of this county was indicted about six years ago in the Warren ^Circuit now^ Equity and Criminal Court for carrying concealed a deadly weapon. Process was never served on him until <date when="--12">last December</date>, although he was living in this and Logan counties during the last six years. At the time the indictment was found against him he had a witness who would have proven his justification in carrying the weapon; but that witness left this county some two or three years ago, and Mr. Morris does not know where he is gone. In consequence of his ^the witness^ absence judgment was rendered against Mr. Morris at this the <date when="--02">February term</date> of our Court for the sum of fifty dollars.</p>
<p>Mr. Morris is a young man just commencing business and is unable to pay the above mentioned fine. We would therefore recommend him to your Executive clemency, and if consistent with your feelings, would <unclear/> of you a remittance of the fine.</p>
<p>Respectfully Yours,
