   <p>&amp;#9758; We have just been a friend of ours, a Kentucky surgeon, who was at Pittsburg Landing during the late battle. He came up on the boat that arrived here on Sunday, and says, that, of the wounded on board, sixty were rebels. He states that Geo. W. Johnston, the Provisional Governor, so-called, of Kentucky, was mortally wounded on Monday, and left on the field, like many hundred other wounded rebels, and that he died on board of one of our boats on Wednesday. Col. James S. Jackson cut a lock of hair from his head and took a letter from him for his wife. Our informant read the letter.</p>
