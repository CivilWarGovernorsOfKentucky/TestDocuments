<p>Formerly Memorialist was a Licensed Tavern Keeper in the City of Maysville, but the present years in consequence of the increased expenses failed and refused to take out License to a Keep a Tavern.</p>
<p>The Memorialist states that some days ago he was <hi rend="str">on</hi> sued by warrant from the Mayor of the City of Maysville for retailing liquor by the glass <hi rend="str">to</hi> <hi rend="str">keep</hi> <hi rend="str">strangers</hi>.</p>
<p>He says that when said offence was said to have been committed he was in the ^city of^ Cincinnato Ohio </p>
<p>He says that he is informed that the evidence produced before the Mayor upon trial of said warrant was alltogether vague and unsatisfactory. but he was fined $20 and costs,</p>
<p>He says that since the beginning of the present year he has been particularly careful to avoid selling liquors so ^not^ as to violate the Statute.</p>
<p>He says that the fine inflicted upon him in the present case is unjust and hard -- </p>
<p>Wherefore he prays said fine and costs may be remitted. and for all proper relief.</p>
