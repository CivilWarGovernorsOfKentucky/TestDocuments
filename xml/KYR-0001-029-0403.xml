   <p>To his Excellency the Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>We whose names are hereto subscribed neighbors of Thomas Oats would most respectfully represent and show unto to your Excellency would State: that at the last April Term of the Todd Circuit Court said Thomas Oats was find Sixty five Dollars. On an Indictment for a misdemeanor. Said Oats is an Exceedingly poor man. with a large family of Small children and no one to support them but himself. and we are of opinion said Indictment was more the result of prejudices and a <unclear>feud</unclear> between him &amp; some of his neighbours than of real guilt on the part of said Oats we are of opinion that this is one case that fully authorizes and demands the intervention of Your Executive Clemency. </p>

<p><cb n="2"/>I was in Court when the indictment, was tried against M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Oats, I do not recollect the facts present, but the impression made on my mind, was that the verdict was much more than it should have been, M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Oats is quite a poor man &amp; has a large family &amp; I hope will be relieved. F. M. Bustone<pb/></p>
<p><milestone unit="column" n="1"/>We were not engaged in the case of the Commonwealth against Oats but were in Court during the ^trial^. Our recollection is, that the proof showed that Oats had cut to pieces one wheel of an old wagon. The Witness thought the wagon worth twenty dollars. We learned then or since that Oats claims the wheel &amp; a dispute &amp; difficulty concerning it arose hear between him &amp; his neighbor </p>
<p>We suppose the act of Mr Oats if guilty as charged not fully justifieable but he is a very poore &amp; peaceable man having a large family and we thought &amp; still think the verdict too heavy. We believe no injury to the state or to this Community can result by relieving Mr Oats through Executive Clemency.</p>
