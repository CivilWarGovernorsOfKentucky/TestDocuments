<lb/>To His Excellencye
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramlette,
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>This will be sent to you by Mr Henry T. Harris, who wishes you to extend him the benefit of your executive power, in remitting the forfeiture of a Bond, which he gave under the following circumstances. Some time since, two girls were committed to one Jail, accused of an attempt to commit larceny. They were allowed to give Bail- but being poor, were unable. The Bail was exceedingly high- the prosecution unjust- the charge not founded on fact &amp;c. One of them was very ill, and would probably have died, had she remained in Jail until <date when="--09">September Court</date>. <hi rend="underline">At</hi> <hi rend="underline">my</hi> <hi rend="underline">own</hi> <hi rend="underline">solicitation</hi>, and the solicitation of <hi rend="underline">divers</hi> <hi rend="underline">good</hi> <hi rend="underline">citizens</hi>, and <hi rend="underline">without</hi> <hi rend="underline">fee</hi> <hi rend="underline">or</hi> <hi rend="underline">reward</hi>, Mr Harris filed a petition before me. Police Judge of this town, asking a writ of <hi rend="underline">Habeas</hi> <hi rend="underline">Corpus</hi>, to relieve them, and reduce their Bail- I <hi rend="underline">did</hi> reduce their Bail to $50- ($25 each) are Mr Harris &amp; R M White became their securities- the Bond was <hi rend="underline">forfeited</hi>, and we now appeal to you to release Mr Harris &amp; Mr White, from any payment to the Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> The names of the girls and Delany- sisters. Expense to the State, and<pb/>
<lb/>trouble to the court was avoided by their action in the matter, and the public good generally has not been imposed thereby.</p>
<p>Your truly.

<p>I think this case was remitted at the instance of E S VanWinkle we looked for the Pet &amp; could not find it &amp; my impression is he wrote &amp; got the amts &amp; proposed the remission if not done let it be done</p>
