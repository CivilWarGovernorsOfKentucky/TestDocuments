   <p>To his Excellency Thos E, Bramlett</p>
<p>The undersigned would respectfully submit the following statement of facts for the consideration of your Excellency.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner, Frank Eaton, Agent of Moore, Wilstach &amp; Baldwin of Cincinnati Ohio, in the sale of "Barrett's life of Lincoln" would state that he was fined by the Judges of Fayette County Court, <date when="1865-08-10">Aug 10/65</date>, in the sum of one hundred dollars on a charge of Peddling. Your petitioner, before offering said book for sale, procured a license from the Clerk of the City Counsel of Lexington, authorizing him to sell said Book. Believing it not necessary to procure any further License to enable him to sell in Lexington he proceeded to sell said Book by <hi rend="underline">subscription</hi> &amp; on <hi rend="underline">sample</hi> to be delivered in Sept next. Having no intention of violating any State or municipal Law he prays your excellency will remit the fine imposed, as stated above.</p>
<p>Frank Eaton</p>
<p>We the undersigned join in the above petition &amp; hope the prayer will be granted.</p>
