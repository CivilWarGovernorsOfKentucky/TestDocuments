   <p>Frankfort Ky <date when="1864-02-11">Feb 11. 1864</date>
<lb/>Governor Bramlette:</p>
<p>Today by the judgment of the Police Court of Frankfort Thomas Lee, F. M. C, was fined ten dollars under a warrant charging him with threatening to beat Mrs. Warren. I was present at the trial, and with all due respect to the judge who presided, am satisfied that the judgment was not sustained by the evidence. In fact the evidence of Mrs G. W. Lewis, I thought, clearly vindicated him from the charge.</p>
<p>No man, white or black, in the state bears a higher character than "Tom Lee""; and no one would be farther from using disrespect towards White persons than he. Believing him to be innocent of any intention to act improper, I respectfully recommend a remission of the fine.</p>
<p>I am very Respy
<lb/>Your obdt St
<lb/>James Harlan Jr</p>
