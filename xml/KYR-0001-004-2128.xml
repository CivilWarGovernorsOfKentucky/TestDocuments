<lb/>Your Excellency</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Harrodsburg, beleiving, that in the case of the Commonwealth vs Chas Murphy recently tried before the police court of Harrodsburg upon a charge of breach of the peace injustice would be done by enforcing the Judgment therein rendered respectfully petition your Excellency to <hi rend="str">to</hi> remit the fine therein imposed. In making this statement we intend no disparagement of the learned Judge who ably presides over said court. Upon the evidence before him his Judgment was legally correct. The breach of the peace charged occurred in front of Murphy's house between 8 &amp; 9 P. M on the <date when="1865-06-22">22<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> day of June ^1865^</date> and commenced <hi rend="underline">according</hi> <hi rend="underline">to the testimony</hi> <hi rend="underline">given</hi> upon the trial, with an exclamation addressed by Murphy (who is an old gray-headed man and the father of a large family) to a man by the name of Curtis. Viz "You damned villian you have insulted my daughter" where upon some angry words <pb/>
<lb/>mingled with oaths followed and Curtis drew a revolver and leveled, or was in the act of leveling it at the head of Murphy when his arm was caught by a soldier. Immediately after Curtis drew the revolver Murphy drew a <hi rend="underline">butcher kn</hi>ife (which he seems to have picked up for the purpose of driving away this disturber of the peace of his family) but he also was arrested. The contending parties never approached nearer each other than <hi rend="underline">ten</hi> or <hi rend="underline">twelve</hi> paces and at the time when the pistol was drawn Murphy was standing in the open gate of his own yard Curtis upon the pavement in front.</p>
<p>The said Cha's Murphy is a hardworking mechanic, a peacable lawabiding citizen, in indigent circumstances and has a large family dependant upon him. The difficulty in which there was no blow struck, nor any damage done, originated from insulting language &amp; conduct upon the part of Curtis towards Murphys daughter which Murphy could have proved had not his regard for the delicacy and modesty of his daughter <hi rend="str">prevented</hi> prevented him from<pb/>
<lb/>bringing her into court upon such an occasion; When urged to do so by his friends he replied "I would ^rather^ rot in jail than subject my daughter to that" In consideration of the circumstances above stated and that a reproach may not rest upon a man who merely exercised the God given duty and right of defending the honor of his family We respectfully petition that the fine of $15.00 imposed by the said Judgment be remitted</p>

<p>The signature above is that of the Judge of the police Court who rendered the decision I presume you Excellency will deem any others unnecessary</p>
