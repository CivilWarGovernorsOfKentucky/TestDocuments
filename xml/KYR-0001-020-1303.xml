   <p>To His Excellency Beriah Magoffin Governor of Kentucky it is respectfully represented </p>
<p>That on the night of the <date when="1861-04-11">11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of April 1861</date> Jacob Denny was arrested in the City of Frankfort for making <hi rend="str">and</hi> a noise in the street and other disorderly conduct, Next morning one of his friends came to your Petitioner and told him that some young men had come down from Lexington on a <hi rend="underline">fishing excursion</hi> and were probably a little drunk &amp; noisy the night before, but had done no harm_ and begged him to go before the Police Judge &amp; get Denny released. In as much as they hailed from Lexington altho your Petitioner had no personal acquaintance with them he obeyed their call, and attended the trial. Denny was fined $10 -- his companions went his security. but the officer required a <hi rend="underline">resident</hi> &amp; your Petitioner then signed his name. It turns out, that none of the parties are worth a straw and the officer has called on your Petitioner for Payment. Under these circumstances he hopes the fine will be remitted. He will of course pay the costs amounting to several dollars. The case stands against Jacob Denny Principal and M. C. Hoaglan, James Nixon, John M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Chesney &amp; your Petitioner as securities.</p>
