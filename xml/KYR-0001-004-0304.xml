   <p>To His Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette 
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully represent the case of William T. Martin of Versailles Woodford County Ky.</p>
<p>At the <date when="1863-10">October Term of the Woodford Circuit Court 1863</date>, the said Martin ^having confessed Judgment^ was fined the sum of five hundred dollars for dealing Faro. He is poor and possessed of no means of support than his own exertions upon which he and his family rely. He has also met with a severe accident in the breaking of his leg which will forever disqualify him from physical labor and render him a cripple for life. We recommend him as a proper subject of executive clemency and pray you will remit that part of the fine over which you have power.</p>
