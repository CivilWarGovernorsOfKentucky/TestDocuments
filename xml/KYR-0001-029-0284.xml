   <p>To His Excellency J F Robinson
<lb/>Hickman Ky <date when="1863-03-13">March 13/63</date></p>
<p>Lawson Rigsby -- who was tried at the <date when="1863-03">March term 1863</date> of the Fulton Circuit Court on an indictment for Keeping a tipling house, had it to appear in evidence in his defense that he sold in the house kept by him in good faith under the tavern license of another, but in a house detached from the tavern house -- the witnesses appeared to believe that the selling was done legally under that tavern license &amp; such was the defense offered to be set up by defendant -- the defendant alledging but not proving he acted as apart for the tavern keeper yet all these facts being no defense in law were not regarded by the Jury -- I know nothing personally of defendant &amp; nothing more of the case than as stated above</p>
