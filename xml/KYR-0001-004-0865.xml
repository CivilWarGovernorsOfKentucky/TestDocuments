   <p>To His Excellency Governor Thos E. Bramlette</p>
<p>The undersigned respectfully represents, that the annexed memorandum of testimony taken by the Hon: judge of the Police Court contains all the facts elicited at the preliminary examination of August Worms, upon which he was held to bail in the sum of Three Hundred Dollars to appear at succeeding term of ^the Jefferson^ Circuit Court to answer a charge of felony. The undersigned is a practicing Attorney at Louisville and upon the solicitation of some friends of accused, and upon his opinion that no felony had been committed, but that the facts in law but amounted to a <hi rend="underline">breach</hi> of warranty was induced to became bail, upon being partially indemnified. The accused promised to appear, and the fulfilment of that promise was confidently expected, because of counsel's assurance of the accused's acquittal. He has not appeared and the bond is forfeited. The undersigned respectfully asks your Excellency to remit only so much of the forfeiture as will enable him to discharge it without loss, and without a tax upon his generosity, which alone was the motive of going bail. The undersigned has indemnity equal to two Hundred and three Dollars and he deems it proper to state, that this<pb/>
<lb/>is the first Bail Bond <hi rend="str">for</hi> ^to^ which he signed his name.</p>
<p>Your Excellencys, obdt Svt
<lb/>Martin Bijur</p>
<p>Louisville <date when="1864-05-04">May 4, 1864</date>.
<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>Gov Bramlette</p>
<p>This is the only instance in which I have ever asked a forfeiture or judgement to be remitted &amp; I do so because Mr Bijour has been unusually candid &amp; honest in stating that he has been partially indemnified. I hope your excellency will find in this fact alone sufficient reasons for remitting <hi rend="underline">one hundred &amp; ten</hi> dollars of said judgement= which will cover all costs &amp;c_ The jugement was rendered at the present <date when="--05">May term of our court</date></p>
