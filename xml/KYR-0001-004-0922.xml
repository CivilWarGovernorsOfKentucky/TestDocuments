   <p>To his Excellency Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E. Bramlett.</p>
<p>The undersigned members of the Greenup Bar, state that John E. Winn, was indicted for permitting gameing in his house, was tried at the (<date when="1864-05">May Term 1864</date>) and fined $200<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi>. The proof showed that two or three years ago, cards were played in Winn's Tavern House, on two occassions, for money, but the witnesses stated that the playing was in the private room of a guest late at night with the door locked to prevent the s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Winn, from knowing anything about it, that when footsteps were heard approaching that the cards would be put up &amp; the money put away for fear of its being Winn.</p>
<p>The proof was that on<hi rend="str">e</hi> one occasion ^last summer^ Winn, came into the room ^Where some parties were playing,^ and immediately inquired the nature of the game &amp; finding that the parties were betting, broke it up instantly and would not suffer it to go on to the conclusion of the game being played when he came in. The proof was clearly satisfactory that no playing for money had occured in Winn's house with his knowledge. The witnesses stated that last summer, there was played in Winn's<pb/>
<lb/>house a game at cards. Not a regular game of cards, but some new and amuseing game which and that on several occasions the witnesses (all of whom are <hi rend="underline">gentlemen</hi>) played at this new game to decide who should pay for beer. The witnesses all said that no one considered this playing gameing, that Winn, did not, and would not have permitted if he had thought so, as they knew him to refuse whenever solicited. We regard this as a case of peculiar hardship. and one strongly appealing to the executive clemancy.</p>

<p>As Judge of the Greenup Circuit Court I concur with the entire Bar in recommending Your Excellency to remit the fine against Mr Winn. I am very Sure from a long opportunity of Judging that Mr Winns house is very free from<pb/>
<lb/>being a place where gaming is permitted nor do I believe that he would knowingly allow it for or on any account</p>
