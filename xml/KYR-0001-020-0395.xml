   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioners in behalf of Hezekiah Alexander Jun (a free man of Color) beg leave to state That at the <date when="1859-11">Nov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Term</date> of the Meade Circuit Court, the said Hezekiah Alexander Jun, was Indicted by the Grand Jury of Meade County for breaking into and Entering the dwelling house of John Funk on the <date when="1859-07-20">20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> July 1859</date> in the night time -- They state the said Alexander was tried and found guilty by the petit Jury at the <hi rend="str">said</hi> <date when="1860-05">^the may^ term 1860</date> of the Court, <hi rend="str">and</hi> who assessed his punishment at three years Confinement in the Penetentiary of the State -- They state, the proof on the final trial was, that Alexander in the night came to the window of the House of Funk, and raised the window but the witness could not state that any part of the body or member of the person of the said Alexander entered the house, but the Jury having the right to Judge of the facts, presumed he had to enter to raise the window even though it was ever so slight, <hi rend="str">there</hi> <hi rend="str">was</hi> <hi rend="str">some</hi> the proof of identity was not entirely clear,</p>
<p>The ^main^ witness was a German woman<pb/>
<lb/>indeed the only one ^<hi rend="str">introduced^</hi> ^she was the only witness in the case^ who saw Alexander at the window or spoke of the main fact of Burglary, her testimony was not clear but seemingly honest,</p>
<p>They state the said Alexander was Young at the time, only some eighteen or nineteen years old he had been raised by a shrewed father who was and is <hi rend="str">under</hi> ^a man of^ <hi rend="str">a </hi>^good^ <hi rend="str">bad</hi>good character in the neighborhood, <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> <hi rend="str">wife &amp; daughters</hi> <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> and <hi rend="str">as</hi> ^his <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> sister &amp; mother^ we understand reside in the city of Louisville, so far as your petitioners are advised they are honest, perhapse a fair average of <hi rend="str">for</hi> that class of persons ^who are deemed honest^, we are assured <hi rend="str">that</hi> by the sister of said boy Alexander, that in the event of the release of said boy he shall not return to the county of Meade but they will keep him in Louisville -- In view of this fact and other circumstances connected with his case we ask Your Excellency to release the said boy, from serving the remainder of his time as in the event he should not reform he will again be sent back to the Penetentiary without any hope of Executive Clemency we herewith send a copy of the indictment -- since writing the above, we have thought of the Bill of Exceptions which we herewith send for your examination containing all the proof<pb/></p>
<p>I was attorney for Alexander in the case refered to in the Petition and not believing the verdict was authorized by the Testimony Moved for a New Trial, the court overruled the Motion but intimated the opinion had he been a juror he might have felt Constrained to have found a different verdict but Said he did not feel authorized in disturbing the verdict I Still think the <hi rend="str">verdict</hi>Testimony insufficient to authorize the verdict</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">W. T. Coale</hi></p>
<p>O. C. Richardson Jr -- practising attorney of same bar Endorse. W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> T. Coale's Statement</p>
<p>O. C. <hi rend="underline">Richardson Jr</hi></p>
<p>I indorse the above &amp; foregoing</p>
<p>J S. Taylor</p>
<p>I concur in recommending the exercise of executive clemency to the boy Hez Alexander, Jr. if deemed compatible with duty. I heard the evidence ^in the case^ and at the time doubted its sufficiency to Convict -- then thought but for the want of good character of his father, and to some extent it effected ^on^ him. The result might have been different.</p>
