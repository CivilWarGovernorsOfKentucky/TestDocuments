<p>Sir Joseph H Nedderman was recognized in two cases for his appearance at the <gap/> term of the Boyd Circuit Court to answer to indictments against him one case for cutting with intent to Maim and the other case for Larceny that at the time the Court came in he was sick in the city of Cincinatti and could not appear, that forfeitures were entered in each case, and at the <date when="--05">last May term</date> of the Boyd Circuit Court Judgments were rendered against the Securitie James R Ford for one hundred dollars in the case of Stabbing, and for Three Hundred &amp; fifty dollars in the case of Larceny. That at the time the Jud<pb/>
<lb/>gment was rendered against said securety the principal Joseph Nedderman was and Still is a soldier in the United States Army I enclose the affidavit of his wife to the fact I know and to be respectable I have also seen myself letter from him since he has been in the Army of the Cumberland. He is now wounded and in the Hospital at Nashville Tenn having ben wounded in Georgia, the security is a mechanic and is a man of limited means if he has to pay the Judgment it will considerably oppress him I earnestly ask your Excellency to remitt the Judgment upon the forfeited Recognizances or so much as can be legally remitted I have talked to the Atty for the Commonwealth Mr Dury and he is perfectly willing to have the Judgment remitted</p>
