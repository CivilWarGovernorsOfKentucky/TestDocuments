   <p>To His Excellency The Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner John Kuntz will respectfully represent that for several years he has been the Keeper, under license, of a Coffee house and Tavern in the City of Louisville That he had a license to Keep a Tavern which Expired on the <date when="1861-03-10">10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> March 1861</date>. and that on the expiration of that License, he was negotiating a sale of his Tavern stand and fixtures &amp; expecting to effect a sale, he did not renew his license. but kept his house open for the benefit of the purchaser who was to continue the same business -- The negotiations were continued for some time &amp; finally failed -- for sometime after his failure to effect a sale, he was prostrated by disease and unable to attend to business his house was however kept open and not having renewed his license for the reasons above stated, he was indicted in the City Court of Louisville, at the <date when="1862-01">January Term 1862</date>. in two cases and fined Sixty ($60) dollars in each case for keeping a Tippling house -- besides costs. As soon as he was able and could raise the money he applied to the proper officer and took out his license for a Tavern paying $200<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> therefore the same dating back to the <date when="1861-03-10">10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of March 1861</date>. and expiring <date when="1862-03-10">10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of March 1862</date>. and covering the time for which he was fined The City and State therefore has lost nothing The cost in the two cases will amount to over $40.00 Including the Attorney<hi rend="sup">s</hi> portion of the fines -- </p>
<p>He states it was never his intention to violate the law or defraud the city out<pb/>
<lb/>of her right, and that he did not take out his license for the reasons above stated</p>
<p>He is poor and has a large family to support and is not able to pay the Said fines -- Owing to his sickness he has had heavy expenses to meet and being unable to attend in person to his business he has incurred considerable losses. And as he has done though late what he was prevented from doing at the proper time by the causes before stated, and the City has received all that she claimed for the year from him and he alone is the sufferer to the extent of the costs in the case. he respectfully ask Your Excellency to remit the said two fines of $60<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> each, And he as on duty bound will every pray &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi> </p>
<p>John Kuntz</p>
<p>The unersigned have examined the record and find that the statement made by Petitioner is True, that he did after the Fines were assessed take out a Tavern Licence for which he paid $200 said Licence to run from <date when="1861-03-10">10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> March 1861</date> to <date when="1862-03-10">10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> March 1862</date> his former Licence having Expired <date when="1861-03-10">10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> March 1861</date> We have understood &amp; believe it is True that Petitioner was sick for some time during the year <date when="1861">1861</date> and that he is poor &amp; has a family &amp; under the circumstances we submit to the Governor as our opinion that Executive Clemency Extended to Petitioner would be right &amp; proper as well as a relief to a very orderly citizen</p>
