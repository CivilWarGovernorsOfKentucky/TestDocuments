<p>It appears by the annexed papers, duly authenticated according to the laws of our State, that John Hoffer or Hooper stands charged by indictment (was Convicted and sent to the states Prison) with the crime of Grand Larceny and it has been represented to me that he has fled from the justice of this State and has taken refuge in the State of Kentucky</p>

<p><figure type="seal"/></p>
<p>In Testimony Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused to be affixed the Seal of the State, at the City of Indianapolis this <date when="1863-09-16">Sixteenth day of September in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty=three,</date> the forty eight year of the State, and of the Independence of the United States the Eighty Eighth.</p>
<p>BY THE GOVERNOR,
