<lb/>Hon B. Magoffin
<lb/>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Sir</p>
<p>It gives me pleasure to write <hi rend="str">you</hi> a few lines to your Excellency in behalf of My <hi rend="underline">Friend Francis Searcy</hi> -- I have read the petition which contains the facts though not stated as favorably for Mr Searcy as the proof would have justified still I endorse every word therein contained after having heard the Evidence adduced both at the court of Enquiry and the Examination for bail. -- -- -- -- </p>
<p>Mr Searcy is a respectable man living in a portion of our county noted for its good Morals &amp; enlighted citizens and they have almost to a Man Endorced his petition I know him to be a man of worth with a family, a wife and several ^young^ children dependant upon him for their living and I can state so for as I have heard &amp; believe that it would give general satisfaction of you would Exercise your Executive clemency and relieve him from this prosecution and I may say persecution because I do confidently<hi rend="str">lty</hi> believe that the Commonwealth can in no Event find a verdict against him indeed a large portion of our citizens think and believe that it is carried on more as a matter of persecution to Mr Searcy than for the purposes fo justice -- </p>
<p>I can say further that when the Examining court<pb/>
<lb/>acquitted Searcy the community <hi rend="underline">Generally</hi> approved of their finding and never have I seen a people more <unclear/> than when they learned that the second Empaneled grand jury had found a true bill against him after the first had ignored the bell -- I hope you will consider Mr Searcys petition favorably and release him of this <hi rend="underline">burthen</hi> and heavy <hi rend="underline">Expence</hi> and I do believe that your action wil be approbated by the citizens of this Madison County I am</p>
<p>Sir very Respectfully Yours</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">John G Cole</hi></p>
