   <p>To His Excellency the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner James A Hunt states that a Judgment was entered against him in name of the Commonwealth agt James A Hunt before the Police Judge of Harrodsburg for the sum of Thirty Dollars and costs said Judgement was rendered on <date when="1863-09-17">17 Sept 1863</date>. And was for a breach of the peace.</p>
<p>He states that said breach of the peace was committed by him whilst Mortified and enraged on account of the degrading and unjustifiable treatment your petitioners son had received at the hands of the person against whom the breach of the peace was committed, that in the excitement of the moment and in obedience to an irresistible impulse of our common nature he undertook to avenge a cruel wrong suffered by his child; and that though the strict letter of the law would not justify his course, yet the feelings of a father and the instincts of true manhood goaded by a sense of grievous wrongs would at least excuse him. Your petitioner further states that he is poor and has a large family and is unable to pay the fine, and for these reasons he asks of Your Excellency the exercise of clemency.</p>
<p>James. A Hunt</p>
