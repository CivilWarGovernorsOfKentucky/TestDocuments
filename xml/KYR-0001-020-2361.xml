  <body>
   <p>To his Ex'cy Chas. S. Morehead
<lb/>Governor of the Com'th of Ky -- </p>
<p>Your Petitioners respectfully represent that Wash Eblen was at the <date when="1858-10">Octr term 1858</date> of the Franklin circuit court on an indictment for murder convicted of manslaughter and sentanced to the Penetintiary for five years -- And it was proven on the trial that Eblen was a man of peaceable habits, of a quiet and <unclear/> disposition and at times subject to fits of mental abrration that he was usually of a sober and industrious turn, of a very modest and unoppressive manner except when drunk and that even there he interferes with no one unless some attack was made on himself or some one of those that were dear and near to him, it was proven on the trial of his cause that at the time he shot M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cundy that he was very drunk -- so drunk that he even, when angry would vent his wrath on inanimate and senseless objects that the time of the shooting he had been drunk for some time, and some of the witnesses thought him laboring under maniac <unclear/> -- that he was not a regular drinker but was only an occasional one -- one who took a spree when he was led off by his friends and associates, that he was poor, and to a considerable extent friendless -- that he was the son of an old<pb/>
<lb/>and widowed mother of a very highly respected family and connexion who was to a great extent dependant on his labor of her convict son for her support -- Your petitioners further represent that the s<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> Eblen as they have been informed and beleive since his confinement in the penitentiary conducted himself in a most exemplary manner, <unclear/> faithful steady, trust worthy and obedient -- wherefore in view of the premises, and of the fact that a longer confinement in the penitentiary would <unclear/> rather to corrupt and harden the prisoner, Your petitioners respectfuly yet earnestly beg of your Ex'cy to pardon the said Eblen and restore him to his old mother and to society as we feel and beleive that he has most heartily repented of his rash deed -- and that He should be pardoned and restore to all his former rights &amp; franchises -- respectfuly Your Ob'dt servants -- </p>
