<p>Isaac Bush states, that he saw the corpse next morning, helped to dress it, saw a hole in his left side saw bruise on his elbow, and two bruises on the breast one on one side, the other on the other side, the bruise was on the left elbow -- They presented the appearance of having been done by the muzzle of a gun, thought he could see the squares of the barrel and the place of the bore -- saw other bruises on his right arm, but thought they might be produced by falling among the chips and gravel, saw several other dark places about the body, face &amp;c. as though the blood had settled -- His attention was called to the places that had the appearance of having been done by a gun barrel -- three of the Warrens &amp; Johnson were present at the time the dressing took place -- </p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Elzy Warr</hi>en states that he was at the house at the time the fuss commenced, and saw but little of the affiar W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Peace was about ten feet nearer the croud than<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">13</note>
<lb/>he was, there was no obstruction between him, and where the croud was -- a fence run between them, but he was on so much higher ground than it was, it presented no obstrution, as to all that was goin on, could not distinguish the parties as they mingled through the croud, but thought one was Peace at the time he heard the fuss was siting with his back to the croud -- saw one bruise, which had the appearance that it might have been done wiht a gun barrel or such an instrument On cross examination, states he did not call the attention of Isaac Bush to the bruises on the body of deceased, saw several dark places about him, about his face and eyes &amp;c as though the blood had settled there -- </p>

<lb/><note place="header">14</note>
<lb/>and stop that fuss --  --  --  -- 
<lb/>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> D. P. White -- states that he is a regular Physician and that he had practised medicine many years. He gave it as his opinion, that a bruise inflicted on a person immediately before death, would show plainer than if inflicted at a remoter time from death -- On cross examination was asked that, if it was not necessary that a reaction of the circulation should take place after the violence was done, and that if death should take place before that reaction should take place, what would be the consequence? He gave it as his opinion that the bruise would after death present a deep<hi rend="str">er</hi> impression than if it had taken place more remotely from killing Here the Commonwealth closed her testimoney, and the Defendant then introduced the following witnesses</p>
<p>Defen<hi rend="underline">dants W</hi>itnesses</p>
<p>W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Peace S<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Was some 40 or 50 yards distant from the croud when the fuss commenced -- The first witness heard was the voice of Bob Peace saying Felix, do not draw your pistol on me -- witness turned his head immediately and saw Beauchamp throw his hand behind him very quick with the pistol in it, they run then close together, when the pistol was drawn they seperated a little &amp; Peace presented his gun at Beauchamp and said shoot if you want to, or something to that amount about that time Mitchell Warren, caught him and turned him round or partly so -- At that instant Beauchamp steped a little round the croud, and Beauchamp advanced within two feet of Peace and fired his pistol at Peace, Beauchamp immediately turned and rather threw himself back on the ground, owing as he thought to throw some of the croud between Peace &amp; himself,<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">15</note>
<lb/>Peace then fired immediately, the shots in quick succession, in about such quick succession, as a man fireing a double shot gun -- When Beauchamp fell or threw himself down, it was rather on all fores, with his face and left side rather presented towards Peace, at the same time rather raising his body in a strugle to get up or further to throw himself from Peace -- After the parties had passed a little round the croud heard Peace say shoot if you think proper -- After Mitchell Warren had turned him around, he passed in the croud, and he could not see him so well until he reached the lower end of the croud -- Whilst in the croud, I did not see any one holding him -- Did not see him knock Wesley Elkins down -- Always saw the parties friendly, often saw them gaming together -- He saw Beauchamp after he fired the pistol run around several men before he fell -- </p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Jacob Peace</hi> stated that he was just 45 yards off from Peace and Beauchamp, that he had since steped it, that he was on much higher ground, than they were, that there was nothing between them to obstruct his view except as they would pass through the croud -- there was a low fence between them, but it afforded no obstruction to his view, he was in company with W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Peace S<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> and others at the time the fracas began between Peace and Beauchamp -- the first thing he heard, was some one say darn you, dont you draw your pistol on me, or dont shoot me with your pistol, cant say which was the form of expression, but thinks it was the latter cant give precisely the expression, he looked that way immediately as he looked, he saw the small man throw his hand behind him with something in it which he<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">16</note>
<lb/>took to be a pistol -- he did not know who either of the men were at that time, and could not tell at that distance, one was a little man, the other was larger and had a gun -- they backed through the croud a little, and the little man, fired a pistol at the large man who fired his gun immediately, the shots were in quick succession; this was all I saw, or heard, there were many others much closer than I was, and had a much better opportunity of seeing and hearing than I did -- </p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Burks Davis</hi> says he was on the ground when the occurance happened -- the fuss grew out of a difficulty between Bill Mat Skaggs &amp; Warf -- The first he saw of Beauchamp, he was coming up, and passed through the croud -- At the time Beauchamp came up Peace had his gun in his left hand with the breech on the ground, or on his foot The parties passed through the croud a little -- Peace about this time threw Wesley Elkins from him, and against me. The gun was not bearing upon Beauchamp, at the time Beauchamp shot, pointing rather to one side -- As soon as the gun was not bearing on Beauchamp, he fired his pistol at Peace within two feet of him -- Beauchamp immediately dodged round the croud a little and fell, or stumbled and fell -- Peace then shot, some two or three persons had got between me and the parties about the time Peace shot -- The parties always friendly so far as he knew or believed -- Witness had lived in the neighborhood some 15 months, was not the tenant of Peace, but lived with a man who rented a place of Peace's -- was frequently at Peaces house -- Saw Peace push his gun forward, but did not see Peace punch Beauchamp with it -- and heard Peace tell Beauchamp to shoot his damned little pistol, was Peaces relation, and boarded with him part of the time -- <pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">17</note></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">John Warren</hi>, states that after Beauchamp had backed some little distance, perhaps 7 or 8 feet, he told Peace not to shoot him -- Peace said put up your damned little pistol then; Beauchamp said, I have none but witness states that he did then have it, in his hand behind him, and witness saw it, other things were said during the fracas, but witness dont remember them -- </p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Josiah Skaggs</hi> stated that he was present that Beauchamp had his pistol in his hand behind him, before he saw him give back any -- He heard Peace tell Beauchamp not to draw his pistol on him, before witness saw Beauchamp give back any, and before Peace drew his gun on Beauchamp -- </p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Otowa B Skaggs</hi>, says that he was present when the killing took place -- the difficulty arose from a quarrel between Bill Mat Skaggs &amp; Warf concerning a game of cards for 10 cents -- Peace went up at the time Skaggs had his hand in his pocket, and told Skaggs that he had a rock in his pocket, and that it would have done him no good to throw it. At this time Beauchamp came up in a fast walk passing witness -- Peace said darn you, dont draw your pistol on me -- Peace then drew his gun up before him in both hands, and cocked it, and presented it at Beauchamp -- they then retreated back, out of the croud, and got out of my sight, I heard the pistol fire, and saw Beauchamp wheel and start back and fall, and Peace shot him -- Bill Mat Skaggs &amp; Peace were engaged, when Beauchamp passed witness and went up to Peace -- Peace at that time pushed Bill Mat, off -- <pb/>
