<p>I have organized a Home Guard styled the Hancock Co Home Guard as an infantry or rifle company, and in conformity with the late act of the legislature all the officers and mentors of the comy took the necesary oath prescribed by law. And the election of officers was held in the presence of the county Judge &amp; both officers &amp; men were sworn in, in his presence as will appear by his certificate hereunto accompaning this application for arms.</p>
<p>The members of this Company are composed of our most worthy citizens and though the have many more names enrolled among the members get many were absent at the time of takeing the oath, and we would most respectfully beg that you would send us a full compliment of arms for each member, enrolled</p>
<p>We would prefer the Kentucky Rifle -- our county is much exposed being immediately opposite the town of Carrolton &amp; our negro population subject to be tampered with by the<pb/>
<lb/>maurading parties from the other side of the River, but Ten of our citizens have arms of any kind.</p>
<p>The Bond necessary to be given if you will send me the form and the amount I will have satisfactorily given hoping soon to hear from you I</p>
<p>remain respectfully your
