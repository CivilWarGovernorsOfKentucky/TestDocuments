<lb/>To his Excellency Thos. E Bramlette

<p>Dear Sir on the other page of this petition you will find the affidavit setting for the case of the Commonwealth against James Keeth a citizen of Clay County Ky which I think fully Embraces the facts in the case I am well acquainted with the Defendant James Keeth know him to be a poor Labouring and honest upright citizen and no wise desireing to violate the Law if he knew it such being the case I think it would be a deed of Charity worth Exercising your perogative</p>
<p>he is an illitterate man of noble intentions and Earnestly hope you will remit the fine and relieve the old man from further annoyance</p>
