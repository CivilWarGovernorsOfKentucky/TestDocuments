<p>It appears by the annexed papers, duly authenticated according to the laws of our State, that James A. Clemmons stands charged by indictment with the crime of feloneously murdering, Beverly J. Dickerson and it has been represented to me that he has fled from the justice of this State and has taken refuge in the State of Kentucky</p>
<p>Now Therefore, I Oliver P. Morton, Governor of the State of Indiana, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws of the United States, do, by these presents, demand that the said James A. Clemmons be apprehended and delivered to Richard Dickerson who is hereby authorized to receive and convey him to the State of Indiana, that he may abide his trial for the crime with which he stands charged. "The State will pay no part of the expenses of the execution of this Writ."</p>
