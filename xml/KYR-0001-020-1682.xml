   <p>Morganfield Union County Kentucky
<lb/><date when="1862-02-07">February the 7<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> 1862</date>
<lb/>Govenor Magoffin</p>
<p>I was shown a petition addressed to your Excelency praying the repreave of Vincent Shields a Convict in the Kentucky penitentiary from this county convicted under a charge of killing his wife -- the petition Sets forth the substance of the evidence given on the <hi rend="underline">trial</hi>. I was requested to sign said petition, which I could not do, Because I did not heare the trial &amp; of couse could not certify what was the testimony On the trial -- though I have no doubt it is Correctly set forth, by the draftsman of the same who would not make a statement to deceive any person, &amp; I know he was present &amp; heard every thing that was deposed -- I will say this in behalf of Shields petition, after his trial &amp; conviction, I heard a general public opinion expressed, that the testimony did not warrant the Conviction, I think a Majority of persons who talked about the case so expressed themsleves. </p>
<p>Shields Stood fare in this Community before this occurance happened, he is connected with a clever family in this County &amp; Spencer, he is an old man &amp; cannot live out his time in the Penitentiary -- and I believe his case is worthy of executive Clemency. Yours respectfully</p>
