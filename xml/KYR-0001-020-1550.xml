<lb/>His Excellency</p>
<p>Governor, I never asked for the release of any convict, but I have been much struck with the manly bearing &amp; the conduct of Elam Milly and also with the conidence the Keepers of the Prison have placed in him He was convicted for a short term and for a small offence; he has faithfully served the Commonwealth not only without a guard but at large as the Agent of the Prison. Six weeks are only remaining of his time, give him that Restore him to liberty &amp; his rights as a citizen, he is a stout firm looking fellow in the rigour of manhood, his county is in trouble and needs his services, give him a chance</p>
<p>Truly Yours.
