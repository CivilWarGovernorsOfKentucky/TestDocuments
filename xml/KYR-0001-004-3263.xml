<lb/>To His Excelency
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Ky</p>
<p>Governor I Do not often appeal to the executive Department in behalf of any one for the remissions of claims in favor of the State, against wrong doers, believing that as a general rule all such fines and forfeitures ought to be enforced, but in the present case at the earnest soliciation of Mr. Valandingham, and being familar with all the facts I do not feel at liberty to deny him the benefit of any representation, consistent with those facts, which I may be able to make. Mansfield was really not a very bad man, but had but few acquaintences present when the Judgment was rendered, and being upon a Bail Bond when the case was decided, was called into court<pb/>
<lb/>and then surrendered by his sureties. Being unable to perform the Judgment he was ordered to Jail, and to <hi rend="str">pres</hi> prevent his incarceration Valandingham became his security, feeling confident that there was no danger in doing So. Mansfield Joined the army and has not returned to the country since. Mr. <hi rend="str">Valanding-ham</hi> Valandingham is a poor hard working man, and has upon his hands quite a large and helpless family of children. These facts considered it is believed that his case is a meritorious one and it is hoped your Excelency will interpose in his behalf</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>A D Wardin clk
<lb/>Circuit Court</p>
