<lb/>His Excellency,
<lb/>Governor Magoffin
<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>Messrs. Smith Samuel and Foley, are a committe appointed on the part of a company of Home Guards, for the purpose of procurring arms. The company is formed of excellent materials, and is well dressed. They have had, as a company of State Guards, the arms they now desire to retain as a company. As there is yet a company of State Guards here, having state arms, I suppose this company have a right to retain the arms they now have, I tell them they can rely upon your dealing out to<pb/>
<lb/>them exact, and impartial justice, so far as you have the power as one of the Commission</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Yours
<lb/>John F, Fisk</p>
