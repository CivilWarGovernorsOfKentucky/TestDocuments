<lb/>Col John Boyle
<lb/>Adjt Genl State of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I have the honor to report to you the Casualities of my Command from the <date when="1863-11-14">14<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date>to the <date when="1863-11-17">17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Nov<hi rend="sup">r</hi></date>,,</p>
<p>On the night of the <date when="1863-11-13">13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Nov<hi rend="sup">r</hi></date>. I received orders to hold my Command in readiness to march from the Camp opposite London Town, at 5 Oclock the following morning, and to take Charge of one Section of Henshaws Battery under Command of Lieut Morrison. My Regt being rear guard, all the troops having to pass it. was Sometime after daylight before my Command got in motion, marching four miles to Lenoir Station, there Col Chapin ordered me halt the rear guard, and allow the men to buid fires and make Coffee. remaining here an hour, I received an order from Col Chapin to take the advance with my Regiment, and march back on the same road to London, advancing up to LOndon. I found no enemy -- </p>
<p>Changing direction to the right, I was ordered to move in the dircetion of Huffs ferry -- Six miles down the<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">2</note>
<lb/>river, and opposite London -- reaching Some rugged hills and heavy timber, I ordered Capt Twyman to advance with his Company to the point and deploy as Skirmishers, to feel the enemy reported in the hills and timber -- the Capt Soon had his men in line as Skirmishers, Covering the front and flanks of my Command joining his right with the Skirmishers of the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ill Regiment who had been ordered up on my right, having advanced about two miles the enemy -- Showed himself by firing on my Skirmishers trying to retard their advance -- they -- were soon driven back by my Skirmishers, to within a mile of Huffs Ferry. where they ran upon two Regiments of Rebel Infantry posted on the Crest of a hill behind a rail fence, a good natural fortification -- compelling my Skirmishers to fall back to the Regiment -- Seeing this I ordered my Regt under the Cover of a ridge my left resting in the River in an exposed position from the enemys fire -- fighting an hour -- I was ordered with my Regiment to Charge the enemy's front <hi rend="str">up</hi> across an Open field up a very Steep hill Some three hundred yards. -- The 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ill advancing at the Same time on my right. the order was obeyed, and, the enemys position carried in handsome Style -- <pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">3 3</note></p>
<p>In this Charge forty one of my men fell Killed and Wounded, Occupying the enemys position, I received Orders to halt and remain in line of battle until further orders, the enemy Shelling me from the opposite Side of the river -- but it was now too dark to ascertain our exact position, so they effected nothing -- </p>
<p>Remaining in this position until daylight of the <date when="1863-11-15">15<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi></date>I was orderd to move my Command back in the same direction from which it Came -- in line of battle occasionally facing about and awaiting a few moments to give the enemy a fight if he pressed us -- getting into the main road,, I was ordered back to Lenoir Station Some 10 miles -- arriving there about 3 Oclock P M -- took a position to fight the enemy -- who was at that time following our rear -- Remaining at Lenoir until 6 Oclock A M,, on the <date when="1863-11-16">16<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> I was ordered to withdraw my Command back to the main road leading to Knoxville -- Marching Seven miles to Campbells Station -- where I was again ordered to form my Regiment in line on the left of the 23<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> Michigan Volunteers when the enemy attacked our lines, and a fight ensued lasting from 1 Oclock P M until dark -- the enemy massing his forces<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">4</note>
<lb/>on our right left and Center -- well Supported by artillery -- during the engagement Col Chapin being quite ill, I was ordered to take Command of the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Brigade. -- the fireing having ceased -- I was ordered with my Brigade to Cover ^the retreat of^ that portion of Genl Burnsides Army -- receiving instruction<hi rend="sup">s</hi> from Brig Genl White Commanding division. he ordered one Section of Benjamins regular Battery two Regts of Cavalry -- and two Companies of the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky -- Mounted Infantry to report to me -- </p>
<p>In this emergency I offered the enemy battle -- facing about, changing front, deploying as Skirmishers and giving them an occasional voly from the Artillery holding my brigade well in hand, obedient to evry Command, the enemy were Completely Checked and held back during the night,</p>
<p>We arrived at Knoxville at 6 Oclock A M -- the <date when="1863-11-17">17<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date>. -- </p>
<p>During the battle at Campbells Station My Regt lost (17) Seventeen men wounded -- </p>
<p>I must not forget to mention the names of these gallant and efficient officers who were wounded at the Battle of Huffs ferry, Capt Jett of Co (K) Lieut Stratton of Co (J) Lieut Cabble of Co (G)<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">5</note>
<lb/>all wounded while at the front leading their brave boys in the Charge -- Lt Steannan killed while at the head of the Company -- </p>
<p>Lt Col B P Estes nobly performed his duty and was at his post during the engagement<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> -- </p>
<p>Major J P Duncan had his horse killed under him during the thickest of the fight, and deserves much credit for his gallant Conduct in the field</p>
<p>Capt Caldwell Act Adjt. was ever ready to Communicate any order from me to my officers he deserves much praise -- </p>
<p>Capts Thompson Patteson Butler Victor Twyman Woodruff, as well as Lieuts Christn. Bradley and M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cracken Commanding Companies deserve special mention for their promptness and bravery during the engagement at Huffs ferry -- and Campbells Station, Many thanks, to the other brave Lieuts of the Regt. "With one exception" well known to all the Officers and private Soldiers in the Command -- of my brave boys the privates and Non Commissioned Officers of the Regiment I cannot Speak too highly of their Conduct -- for they performed their duty nobly -- And it<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">6</note>
<lb/>would be difficult -- to say who performed his part the best</p>
