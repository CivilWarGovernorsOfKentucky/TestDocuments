   <p>To his Excellecy 
<lb/>B Magoffin 
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth 
<lb/>of Kentucky </p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Oldham County would respectfully represent to your Excellency that at the <date when="1862-04">April Term 1862</date> of the Oldham Circuit Court, V. Ackerman was fined in the sum of Sixty dollars upon an Indictment charging him with keeping a tipling house, The evidence conduced only to show that nearly twelve months previous to the finding of the Indictment the accused had on two occasions sold wine at his house &amp; received pay for it, We are satisfied from the statements of Mr. Ackerman that he was wholly ignorant of his error. He is the owner of a vineyard and manufactured the wine he sold. He is a foreigner by birth, and wholy unacquanted with the laws of this Country, He is moral &amp; <unclear/>, &amp; honest in all his business transacting. so far as we have ever heard and the coersion of this fine together with two costs would be a severe loss to himself and family, We therefore ask your Excellency to remit the said fine &amp; will ever pray &amp;c</p>
