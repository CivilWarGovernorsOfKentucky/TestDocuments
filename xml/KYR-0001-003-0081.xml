<lb/>His Excellency,
<lb/>Govnor Bramlett,
<lb/>Frankfort Ky.
<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>Learning that the quota of your State is not full, I have the honor of Submitting to you the following proposition, viz If the State will pay a Bounty of $100, to each man when duly mustered into the United States ^service,^ and Credited to the State. I togather with others interested with me will within 100 Days from the time of receiving the authority raise and organize from one to three thousand men, drilled Soldiers. All we would require would be a certificate from the Secy. of State approved by you certifying that the State pay the Bounty named, and the proper authority from you to organize one, two or three Rgts. We should get our men from Europe, ostensibly to colonize wild lands owned by us but with a full understanding that when on Ship Board they were to enlist -- We have already operated some what this way. but in this State the appropriation for Bounty purposes is about extra<pb/>
<lb/>-<unclear/> &amp; the quota about full -- </p>
<p>Understanding that Ky. is paying $125, Bounty of course the State runs no risk in pledging $100, on the conditions names. If you receive the proposition favorably I will forward to you sufficient vouchers as to my character. capacity &amp;c</p>
<p>Be kind enough to advise me -- I have the honor to be Sir
<lb/>Very Truly
<lb/>You Obt. Srvt.
