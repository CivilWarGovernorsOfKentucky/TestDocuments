<lb/><date when="1865-09-25">Sept. 25. 1865</date>
<lb/>To Major Brown
<lb/>Inspector 1 D. D. Ky
<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>In compliance with orders from Gen. Hd. Qrs. Dept of Ky. to furnish report of certain Transactions in regard to interfering with Civil Officers &amp;c at Harrodsburg. Ky a short time since I have the honor to make the following statement viz:</p>
<p>On or about the <date when="1865-09-10">10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Sept.</date> while on duty at Harrodsburg with a detachment of Co "B" 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky S. C. C. I had an occasion to interfere with a policeman whose name I do not know: In the excise of what I thought to be an outrage on his <hi rend="underline">part</hi> for the following reasons. a day or so before this transaction took place a certain party of men came into Harrodsburg. Ky with the avowed purpose of hanging a man by the name of John<pb/>
<lb/>Hale formerly a Lieutenant in the Federal service and subsequently a Colonel of a Militia Regiment in that County of which Harrodsburg is a county seat -- But now out of the service and on this day spoken of Mr. Hale recognized one of the ring leaders who attempted to commit this outrage and who with the rest of the party are returned rebels or their abettors, and Mr. Hale called this man to account for what was done a day or so previous at this the ringleader aforesaid, as it is claimed by several citizens attempted to draw a pistol or some weapons at which Mr. Hale drew his pistol and threatened him not to use any weapons or he would shoot him immediately, at this juncture or some time afterwards, the policeman spoken of arrested Mr. Hale, and entirely ignoreing the guilty party, who were the real disturbers of the peace and quit of Harrodsburg -- Ky for the simple reason he like all the rest of the police force of that town (as far as my knowledge Extends) are made up of returned rebels<pb/>
<lb/>converted Guerillas or intense sympathizers whose greatest object of Hatred are negro Troops or those that have any respect for them or their officers that command them and this is what I consider to be the whole substance of the outrageous attacks and which led to the arrest of Mr Hale by a set or click of men that are notoriously dishonest as they are <hi rend="underline">disloyal</hi>, and viewing things in this light I considered it my duty to interfere with Mr Hales arrest which may have been wrong in a Political point of view, but you certainly must agree with me in saying that it was right in the point of Justice, hoping that my conduct will not be considered presumptive, as my motives were <hi rend="underline">just</hi> or I thought so at least</p>
<p>I have the honor, to be
<lb/>Your Obt Svt
