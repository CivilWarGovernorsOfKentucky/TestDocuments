   <p>To His Excellency, Hon James F. Robinson.</p>
<p>The undersigned would respectfully represent that John I. Williamson ^of Cattlettsburg^ went the security on a recognizance bond of Joseph McKinney, for $250,,00, to appear before the circuit court at Boyd County ^in its <date when="1862-04">April Term 1862</date>^ to answer the charge of Horse Stealing. Said Williamson did not know the Deft. further than that he was a Union Home Guard, &amp; believeing that it a was a Secession persecution maliciously set on foot against him, he went his bail. McKinney did not deny takeing a horse, but said he done it in the service of his country in whose cause he was engaged fighting. McKinney afterwards left with the army &amp; has not since been heard from &amp; it is not therefore known whether he has been killed or not -- Under these circumstances ^the bail Bond was forfeited <date when="1863-04">Apl 1863</date>^ we pray your Excellency to remit the forfeiture as we believe it to be a case that deserves your clemency &amp; Executive interposition.
