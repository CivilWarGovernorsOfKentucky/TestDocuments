   <p>Hon Thomas E. Bramlett
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>At the <date when="--08">August</date> Term of the Bracken Circuit Court Saml P. Shover was fined in two cases $60 -- Each for keeping a tipling House -- The cases merit the clemency of the Executive -- </p>
<p>The form of Foster Granted Shover license to keep a Coffee House and Shover supposing that he had complied with the law went on and sold liquor without first having obtained license from the County Court of Bracken &amp; paying the State tax. The Court decided that his town license did not protect him and he was fined $60 -- in two cases making $120 -- We feel sure no criminal act was intended by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Shover and that he ought to be released of his fine -- </p>
<p>Unwilling to lend our name &amp; aid to Excuse real violators of the law, we appeal to your Excellency in this behalf because of its merit -- </p>
<p>Jos Doniphan
<lb/>Thornton F. Marshall</p>
<p>Gov. Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>You will observe from the above communication of the Hon. Jos Doniphan (Judge of the Bracken Circuit Court that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Shover obtained &amp; <hi rend="underline">paid</hi> for a liscense, &amp; acted in good faith, &amp; without the slightest intention<pb/></p>
<p>of violating the law. He believed he was authorized to carry on his business of a "<hi rend="underline">Coffee House</hi>" under his liscense. The Liscense as the Judge states was introduced as a defense, but the court <hi rend="underline">properly</hi> divided it was no protestion, I think it a meritorious case, <hi rend="underline">very</hi> strongly calling for your intervention. If you concur with me, please send to me the evidence of its remission -- At Augusta.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Thornton F Marshall</hi><pb/></p>
<p>Bracken Cir Ct.

<lb/>S. R. Shover
