<lb/>Frankfort, Ky., <date when="1864-08-01">August 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, 1864</date>.
<lb/>Adjutant Genl John Boyle
<lb/>Frankfort Ky -- 
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Your resignation of the office of Adjutant General of Ky has been received accepted and filed on this day.</p>
<p>As you submitted to me before coming to any determination yourself -- your plans and prospects and had my approving advice, it is not necessary that I should say more than that I was constrained by my judgement and my regard for your personal interests to give my approval to your proposed resignation</p>
<p>In thus severing our official relations which have been so<pb/>
<lb/>confidential and harmonious, I feel that I part with a friend to whom I am greatly indebted for the faithful and efficient discharge of the public duties which devolved upon <hi rend="str">your</hi> his responsible office.</p>
<p>Be assured that you bear with you the earnest wishes for your success in your profession, -- in your private fortunes and your personal wellfare of</p>
<p>Your friend
<lb/>Tho E Bramlette
