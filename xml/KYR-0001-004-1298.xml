<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Gov Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I have not been troublesome to you Since you have been Governor of Kenty; Some 18 months since a young man by the name of James W Sullivan was indicted in this Court for forging receips <hi rend="str">t</hi> of Attorneys. Signing the names of his neighbours to Rep Bonds &amp;c 5 Indictments after much exertion ^of^ <hi rend="str">with</hi> the Clerk he was Caught <hi rend="str">in Louisville</hi> Mead County was taken to Louisville and there escaped, Afterwards was taken at Louisville &amp; brought here by a policeman, his bonds was for $1000, 5 of them his father bailed him out &amp; then disposed of his property Judgment has gone against him on the bonds, now he is petitioning <hi rend="str">the</hi> Your Executive Clemency I am Creditably informed that he would have stood his trial if his father had required it! his son is a notorious theaf &amp; has Stolen from his neighbours between four &amp; five thousand Dollars! If the old man would return his son into Court, I would have no objections to releasing the old man but to turn out his son without punishment, is a great imposition upon the Community &amp; the old man had as well suffer some as his neighbours all, I give you the facts as they exist,</p>
<p>Your friend
<lb/>Jesse W Reno Clk of
<lb/>the Muhlenberg Cir Court</p>
