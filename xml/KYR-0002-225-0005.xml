<lb/>Mr Philip Swigert</p>
<p>Dear Sir we have 2 companies hence formed and sworn by a magistrate our county judge having refused to administer the oath becase some of the members belonged to Capt Clines Company they left it for the reason that his company numberd about 190 men and only drew 44 guns Now sir will you please inform us how if at all we can get guns of the state -- we have our officers ellected the ^oath^ administerd and all attested by a maggistrate as above stated</p>
<p>About 45 of Capt Clines men are yet with out arms our men are all true union men and of the right sort but have waited so long for guns that they have almost given out ever getting any We are surrounded completely with Southern rights guns (as they call them selves) who menace us and threaten daly to take the few guns we have from us they have 200 in the county and we 44</p>
<p>They have turned over the state guards guns to home guards is that right we would like to know</p>
<p>Please inform us how to proceed at once
<lb/>and oblig your friend
