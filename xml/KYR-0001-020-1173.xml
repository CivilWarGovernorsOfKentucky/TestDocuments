<lb/>Dear Gov</p>
<p>In addition to what I have heretofore stated I would remark that the Petitioner Bryant &amp; myself have been using all our endeavor to ascertain the whereabouts of the prisoner Taylor intending to procure the necessary requisition from you should we have ascertained that he was out of the state Although I had been his atty I had no hesitation in coming to this determination believing that he had by his course forfeited all claims on me as his atty</p>
<p>Most respy yours
<lb/>Joseph Ricketts</p>
<p>I sent with the other paper the Petition or Statements of Mess Russell, Ease Pettmore &amp; others, but I suppose the letters &amp; records send herewith sufficiently indicate the facts in the case</p>
<p>J. R.</p>
