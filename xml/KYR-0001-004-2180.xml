   <p>Lex. Ky. <date when="1865-08-18">Aug 18. 1865</date>
<lb/>His Excellency Gov. Bramlette</p>
<p>Your petitioner, Samuel Frank appeals to your clemency on the following state of facts: He is a little boy between 12 &amp; 13 years of age; and at the suggestion of his mother and with the view of making some money, he got a few pistols and <hi rend="str">sold</hi> sold ^some^ of them to the soldiers at the camp near Lex.; after first getting permission of the Colonel in command of the Regiment to do so.</p>
<p>On yesterday he was arrested and brought before the Fayette County Judge for peddling without license: He at ^once^ acknowledged what he had been doing; and confessed judgment for $100 -- &amp; costs. He has paid the portion of the same which is costs. He violated the law as above stated ignorantly; and would not have done so, had he known that he was doing wrong.</p>
<p>In view of the above facts, he hopes that you will see in his case a proper one for the exercise of Executive clemency and that you will remit his said fine.</p>
<p>Samuel Frank.</p>
<p>The foregoing is the substance of the facts in this Case.</p>
