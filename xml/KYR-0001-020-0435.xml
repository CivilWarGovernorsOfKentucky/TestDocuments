<lb/>Hon' Beriah M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin
<lb/>Gov" of Kenty
<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed you will find two affidavits from W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Brown and Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Murray exculpating young Hawkins in a material degree, from the charge, for which he was convicted, of having, maliciously stabbed Murry with intent to Kill -- together with a communication from Judge Johnston, as to the character of the witness upon whom testimony he was convicted. The Judge was misinformed as to W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Brown having testified on the trial of Hawkins as stated in his communication. A subpeonea was issued for him but he was absent from the City, and his leading council not supposing that this man John Koenig whom the Judge speaks of would perjure himself to the extent he did, went into the trial without Brown, whom, if he had been present and testifed, his testimony would have, without doubt, procurred the acquital of Hawkins</p>
<p>In a word the whole record with ^regard to^ this youth, now in his twentieth year is, that some five or six years since he was induced to join them K N<hi rend="sup">s</hi> order, but varry soon finding out its true character, had the moral courage to withdraw from them, &amp; speak of them as they deserved, whom, from thence forward they have continued to persecute him in every way and manner<pb/>
<lb/>their hellish ingenuity could <unclear/>. He may have been a wild boy: but it was proven ^on the trial^ by as respectable a citizen as we have who had him in his employ for the last year, that he was an industrious hardworking youth, and in every way reliable and at the same time giving most of his earnings to his poor widowed mother for her support. I hope therefore, from the foregoing facts, which may be relied upon, that Yr. Honor will have no hesitancy in granting him a pardon</p>
<p>with friendly regard, I am dear sir yours truly
