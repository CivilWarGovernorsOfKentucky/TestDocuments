<p>From Mr Hanks I learn that little act for my benefit has passed. If so I wish you would do me the favor to draw the allowance and send to me. For that purpose you can sign my name to any receipt or other writing necessary to get it.</p>
<p>Some time since His Excellency the Gov. told me to get an endorsement from the District Atty. and he would remit some forfeitures for me. I sent him the required endorsement but do not know as he recd. it. And do not know as he sent the remissions as they are Powel Co. cases and he would likely send the remissions to the Clerk. The cases were Commonwealth vs W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Bowen &amp;. W L Stone -- 5 cases against the same defts. I wish you would step in &amp; see if he sent the remissions &amp; let me know. If he did not receive my letter please let me know as <hi rend="underline">soon</hi> <hi rend="underline">as</hi> <hi rend="underline">possible</hi></p>
<p>I am
<lb/>Your obdt Servt
