<lb/>Gov B Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the present Term of the Kenton Circuit Court Joseph Blackwell was fined the sum of two hundred dollars for keeping a Tippling house for three months Joseph Blackwell is now &amp; has been for sometime past a resident of this county. He is a poore man &amp; has a family. &amp; by industry &amp; econemy can only make a support for his family. He is entirely unable to pay said fine in fact it is utterly impossible for him to do it. the only effect will be to keep him in Jail &amp; thereby <hi rend="str">fr</hi> put it out of his power to do anything for the support of his family. Then in that event they would be left in utter want. I no good done. but in the contrary he would be kept at great expense in Jail Blackwell is an ordinary citizen &amp; one who is entitled to the favorable consideration<pb/>
<lb/>of good men generally &amp; I think his case is one that would justify the interposition of executive clemency. I hope that you will feel so too</p>
