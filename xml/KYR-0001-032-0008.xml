   <p>PROCLAMATION BY THE GOVERNOR.<figure type="hr"/>
<lb/>TO THE PEOPLE OF LOUISVILLE.<figure type="hr"/></p>
<p>The insolent and unprincipled enemies of our State and Nation are moving in force upon this city. Of this there is no longer a shadow of doubt. If they shall be enabled to make good their purpose to take possession of the commercial emporium of the State, consequences will follow that will be deplored by every patriot. Now is the time for every friend of his country, its Consitutution, and Laws, to rally to their support. Not a moment is to be lost. Manliness and patriotism alike point out to every one the path of duty; and it is earnestly hoped that no man who values the peace of the State, the safety of the city, the repose of his family, and the integrity of the Commonwealth, will falter now in the discharge of high duty which devolves upon him as a citizen of Kentucky, and a friend of that glorious Union which has come down to us sanctified by so many glorious recollections, and freighted with such inestimable blessings.</p>
<p>I, therefore, AS THE GOVERNOR OF THE COMMMONWEALTH, call upon the citizens of Louisville, young and old, to rally to the defence of their homes, their families, and their city. Attach yourselves, with such arms as you have, to the military force, which, under the gallant Nelson, has determined to peril their lives in your defence. Positions will be assigned you where you can render service and acquire distinction.</p>
<p>This appeal is not to you as <hi rend="italic">a mere matter of form</hi>; its necessity is imperative; and the safety of the city of Louisville demands it.</p>
<p>I repeat, then, let not a moment be lost. Loyal Kentucky expects every man to do his duty at this momentous crisis in her history.</p>
<p>Once more I invoke you TO ARMS; resist your enemies to the death; and poising yourselves upon the right, relay upon the God of Battles and the justice of your cause for success.</p>
<p>Done in the City of Louisville this <date when="1862-09-22">22d day of September, 1862</date>.</p>
<p>JAMES F. ROBINSON.
<lb/>By the Governor:
<lb/>D. C. WICKLIFFE, Secretary of State.</p>
