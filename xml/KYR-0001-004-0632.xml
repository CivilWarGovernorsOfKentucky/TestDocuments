<p>At this <date when="--02">Feby time</date> of this Court Th<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Stone was fined on three indictments for retailing, all the acts complained of were at a Barbacue about <date when="--07-04">4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> July</date>, on Saturday, &amp; I have fully investigated the outside facts &amp; find Stone to be an old man &amp; quite poor yet very respectable, but <hi rend="str">illirate</hi> poorly educated he was in attendance at a barbecue &amp; a man there who had liquor to sell hired Stone to attend to it for a short time the old man supposing it to be a fair way to make an honest penny and break no law did it &amp; was indicted he is not engaged regularly in any such business but is an honest, law abiding hard working man I feel no hestation in recommending his case to executive clemency</p>
<p>Your honor may rest assured I will never recommend any case for pardon that is not deserving &amp; I will here say it is the only case from this term of this court which I regard as having merit in it -- I further say that executive clemency has heretofore in this district been so easy as to encourage crime &amp; vice rather than break it up</p>
