<lb/>Dear George</p>
<p>I received your letter of the <date when="1860-12-24">24th Inst.</date> last night. I will not be able to meet you in New Orleans as I lost my Gin and about 70 Bales of Cotton by fire a few days since and I am now busily engaged getting out timbers for another. I will not be able to leave home in consequence until I get up a new Gin house. Fortunately I was insured for $4000 which will nearly cover the loss -- But inconvenience is very great, as we have yet about 300 Bales to pick and Gin -- </p>
<p>The Draft I sent Hunter &amp; Bruce will be paid, as I have been assured by the house on which it was drawn, since its suspension. I do not doubt but it will.</p>
<p>A few days since I brought Harriett out here as I had not been able to get an offer for her. I do not think I could sell her now for <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">2 </hi>of her value.</p>
<p>You must be sure and stop with us on your return from New Orleans -- I will take no excuse from you. This State has declared for Secession by an overwhelming majority -- Louisiana in a few days will do the same. We will certainly have a Southern Confederacy. Your Brother W H Johnson<pb/></p>
<p>W. H. Johnson
