<lb/>Respected Sir</p>
<p>I take great pleasure in being able to state to you that upon my arrival at home, I found Judge Green, letter had been duly forwarded to me through Adams Express and which I hope has been handed you by our Mutual friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Strange,- and that you have also received the letter announcing the fact that no farther effort would be made to interfere in the matter the letter refered to was written by the Honl. Henry Grider one of the Lawyers engaged in the prosecution and the intimate friend and adviser of both<pb/>
<lb/>the families, and a Gentleman whose Standing in the green river county needs no comment, The <hi rend="underline">signers</hi> to that letter.. Mr Simon Jenkins the Uncle of the young man who was killed, and the Principle prosecutor since the death of Mr. Henry Mitchell. has very cheerfully said that he should not attempt to get up any remonstrance- M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Thos. Jenkins another of the prosecutors and Uncle, and who was one of the Commonwealth<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Witnesses has said he was willing to do anything in his power for the boys releif -- </p>
<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C M Jenkins another of the prosecutors has signed the letter, which I trust fully explains itself, and now may I ask you what more can we do, if anything remains to be done<pb/>
<lb/>you have but to intimate ^it^ and ^we^ will use all our exertions to have your views carefully met. The names of the two Jury men who have not signed the petition we will endeavour to send early next week. I am aware of how you are <hi rend="underline">daily</hi> and <hi rend="underline">nightly</hi> annoyed and would suggest, that any thing farther we may have to do, you can inform our M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Strange and he will do the necessary Writing</p>
<p>Very respectfully
<lb/><hi rend="underline">H. Garnett</hi></p>
