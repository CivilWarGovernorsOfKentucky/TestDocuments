   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E Bramlette Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Marshall County would state that McDonald Hamilton is now confined in the penitentiary at Frankfort under a com^m^utation or conditional pardon granted by your Excellency of a conviction of murder by the Marshall Circuit court The evidence upon which said conviction was based is now on file in the Clerk's office of the court of Appeals to which you Excellency is refered for the facts of the case from which it will appear that the killing was not done by the prisoner but was done by Samuel Guinn It will furthermore appear that said Hamilton was present at the killing by the repeated solicitations of the deceased B, F McNabb It will also appear that said killing took place when the late war was raging and when mens minds were easily excited and scenes of bloodshed were of daily occurence</p>
<p>We would state to your excellency that the course pursued by you is fast producing its intended effect the promotion of the peace of the state Very few indictments are now found <hi rend="str">and</hi> <hi rend="str">th</hi> from the fact that we are a quit and peacable people</p>
<p>We therefore ask your Excellency to make the pardon of said Hamilton absolute that he may be restored to his friends in Tennessee where<pb/>
<lb/>he was reared.</p>
