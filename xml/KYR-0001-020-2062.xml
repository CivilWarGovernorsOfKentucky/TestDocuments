<p>Richard Whittington says at the last term of the Caldwell Circuit Court a Judgment was rendered against him in behalf of the Commonwealth on an indictment for permitting gaming in his house for the sum of two hundred dollars, the ^Judgt^ was by confession and he now says, that on one occasion he did at the instance of certain friends permit games at his house, in which there was only small amounts bet and the same was mainly for amusement as he understood it, and that is the only occasion in which he has ever voluntarily permitted unlawful gaming in his house.</p>
