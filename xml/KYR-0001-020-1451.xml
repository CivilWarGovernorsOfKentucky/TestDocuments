<lb/>BENTON &amp; NIXON,
<lb/>ATTORNEYS AT LAW,
<lb/>Cor. Scott St. &amp; Lower Market.</p>
<p>Covington, Ky.,
<lb/><date when="1861-10-10">Oct. 10. 1861</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>B. Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of Ky</p>
<p>I have read the petition for the pardon of William Nichols and have no hesitation <hi rend="str">of</hi> in saying that I am well satisfied that it contains a true statement of the facts in his case, from my intimate knowledge of the gentlemen who have signed it -- they are members of the bar, clerk jailer &amp; sheriff, all of the highest respectability, and from this and what I have heard about the case, and some little of the testimony, I confess my sympathies are enlisted for Nichols, and I think much more good to the community will be effected by his pardon than by his further punishment -- His neighbors say of him that his character is good -- </p>
<p>Very truly
<lb/>Yours
<lb/>M M Benton</p>
