<p>I beg leave to call your attention to the case of W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Pine, now confined in the Ky Penitentiary, on charge of Horse Stealing, He was sent from the County of Edmonson for the period of four years, and has been in confinement there about 2 <hi rend="sup">1/2</hi> years. I have known him for years, and always regarded him as a<hi rend="str">n</hi> harmless inoffensive man. He assures me that he had not the slighest idea of stealing the horse, ^of^ <hi rend="str">for</hi> the taking of which he was convicted. He says that he was on the road with a load upon his cart, to which was an old trifling horse, the only one he had, and about 3 miles from the place of his destination his beast gave out. He saw a horse loose by the roadside &amp; with no other thought than to go with his cart to the end of his trip &amp; return, he caught the animal and hitched it to his cart. On the route he was met by the owner of the animal, or some one who knew the ownership &amp; arrested for stealing it. He had no proof, &amp; so was convicted, being a stranger comparatively in the neighborhood &amp; without friend or character there. From my knowledge of the man I verily believe he tells me the truth.<pb/>
<lb/>He is an ignorant irishman, at least 50 years old, I should think, has a family in poor circumstances was simply a common laborer.</p>
<p>Capt Todd informs me that he has demeaned himself with such propriety since he has been in prison, that he does not pretend to keep him within the walls or under guard, &amp; told me further that he would call your attention to him and ask his pardon; but I suppose in the multiplicity of his engagements, he has not thought of it.</p>
<p>Sincerely beleiving this to be a proper case for the exercise of Executive clemency, I respectfully ask at your hands a pardon for him.</p>
