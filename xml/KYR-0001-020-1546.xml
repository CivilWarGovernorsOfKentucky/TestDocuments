<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Gov: Magoffin
<lb/>My dear Sir</p>
<p>Angelo Devoto an Italian who lives in this city <hi rend="str">and</hi>was convicted at the last <date when="--05">May</date> term of the Jefferson Circuit Court of receiving stolen property knowing it to be stolen.
<lb/> 
<lb/>Altho the accused had lived in this City for some time past he had never before been charged with any offence. The verdict was that he should be confined in the Penitentary for one year. Devoto is now in our Jail<pb/>
<lb/>and has been <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> in Jail for nearly eight months. He was not sent to Frankfort on his conviction because of his application to the Court of Appeals for a new trial</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that he ought to be pardoned. He is a man of very feeble frame and if sent to the Penitentiary would probably die before the expiration of his term of service</p>
<p>I therefore respectfully suggest to you and earnestly hope that you will pardon him</p>
<p>I am vry respy
<lb/>yr obt srvt

<p>He has a wife who is almost frantic with distress and several very small children. They are soo poor that they have become since his confinement in Jail <hi rend="str">That</hi> <hi rend="str">they on</hi> objects of charity. He kept a small confectionary by which he supported his very helpless family</p>
<p>He is a very obscure man, an Italian who knows <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>scarcely any thing of our language</p>
