   <p>The undersigned citizens of Pendleton Co respectfully represent to his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky that James Abernathy a young man residing in Falmouth has been fined fifty dollars in the Lexington City Court for carrying a concealed weapon -- that the knife which he had was found by him as they learn, on the cars as he was going from Falmouth to Lexington and was not carried or worn by him for the purpose of being used or with any intent to retain it -- As he is very young, being only 21 with a widow mother, without any estate, it is a great hardship upon him under the circumstances to be compelled to pay said fine &amp; we therefore request your Excellency to remit it.</p>
<p>Saml. F. Swoope
