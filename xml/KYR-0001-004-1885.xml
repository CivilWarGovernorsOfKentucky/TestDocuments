   <p>To His Excellency, Thos. E. Bramlette, Govenor of Kentucky; -- </p>
<p>Your petitioner P. M. Hale, states that on the <date when="1864-05-30">30<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of May, 1864,</date> he became surety on the bail-bond of Miner Morgan, a free boy of color, for his appearance in the Mercer Circuit Court at its <date when="1864-07">July term, 1864,</date> to answer the charge of larceny for which he had been indicted, the amount of said bail-bond being one hundred dollars ($100) -- He further States that ^shortly^ after the execution of said bail bond ^before the <date when="1864-07">July term 1864^</date> the said Miner Morgan went into the Federal army as a Soldier ^without the consent of your petitioner^ and has ever since ^been^ and now is in said army as a soldier; and for this reason the said Miner Morgan did not appear in Court in compliance with the bond of your petitioner, who could not for this reason have been in Court. Petitioner States that at the <date when="1864-11">November term, 1864,</date> of said Court the said bail-bond was forfeited, and summons issued thereon against affiant; and that at the <date when="1865-05">May term, 1865,</date> of said Court judgment was rendered against your petitioner for one hundred dollars on said forfeited bail-bond -- He states that at the time of the forfeiture of said bond, and long before, and also at the time of the rendition of said judgment the said Miner Morgan was in the United States Army, and for this reason your petitioner could not have him in Court -- </p>
<p>In view of the premises petitioner asks your<pb/>
<lb/>Excellency to remit so much of said judgment as is permissible by law. He says the statements of the foregoing petition are true -- </p>
<p>P. M. Hale</p>
