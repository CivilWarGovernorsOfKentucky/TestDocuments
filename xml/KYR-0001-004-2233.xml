<lb/>His Excelency Thomas E. Bramlett
<lb/>Governor of the Comonwealth of Kentucky
<lb/>Frankfort Ky</p>
<p>Dear Sir -- I would humbly Recommend to your Mercy Milton B. Cox <hi rend="str">he</hi>who has been Sentenced to the State Prison of Kentucky for the term of five Years. From the ^best^ and most reliable information that i have relative to his trial it is apparent that there existed prejudices <hi rend="str">agan</hi> against him. which deprived him of Justice -- See the accompnying petition -- Milton B. Cox is a Young man who I believe was generally regarded as a worthy<pb/>
<lb/>Youth, until he was charged with the robbery for which he was convicted</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>E, K, Blanton</p>
