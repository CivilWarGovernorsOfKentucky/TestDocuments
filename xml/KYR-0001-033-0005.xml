<p>Affiant states that on the day of <date when="1862">1862</date>: He was standing on the Street in the City of Louisville: when C S Stancliffe Chief of the Police of Louisville came up: and said he was looking for some one to take the dying Declarations of a man who had Just been shot on market street, Squire Clements told him that A Maas was a Notary Public and that he would do it: The said Stancliffe then requested the said Mass, to go around to a certain house in which the man was lying: and to take his dying Declarations as to the person that had wounded him Affiant accompanied Maas and Standcliffe to the house on market street, and found the man in the third-story of the building: Several persons were in attendance, and told the man that he could not recover. to which he made no reply, but his face appeared resigned in expression: and he was evidently sinking under the wound: A Maas said to the wounded man, "that he Maas was an officer: and that he could not lie, and he wanted to take his dying declarations as evidence against the man who had shot him. the man looked at him and appeared resigned and despondent: Maas then asked him, if he knew the<pb/>
<lb/>man who had shot him, and he replied that he did; and that it was the second man that was brought in, and his name was Fred Wyman: that he shot him and stevens was with him: The man seemed to be in pain at times, and several around said he must die, and the man said nothing in reply: to the suggestion of any one. but his face and look were the expression of a man resigned: and when Maas told him what he did, I believe he was confident that he would die:</p>
