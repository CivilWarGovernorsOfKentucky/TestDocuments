<p>Your petitionor further States; that after the surrender of the Confederate armies, he considered the cause of the South lost, returned to his home &amp; took the oath of Amnesty as required by your proclamation<pb/>
<lb/>with a settled determination to abide by the results of the War &amp; to be in future a peacable orderly &amp; great citizen -- He found upon his return home, that proseedings had been instituted ag<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> him at Louisville for the Confiscation of his Land in Christian County, which is now pending -- Whilst your petitioner does not believe that he has been guilty of any offence which would justify its confiscation under the Law -- He is nonetheless anxious not only to secure pardon for his offences ag<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> the government but also to have the suit dismissed -- that he may be enabled to remain peaceably at home &amp; perform his duty as a good citizen of the U. S and aid as far as his humble means will allow in restoring the Government to what it was before the War &amp; bring prosperity once more to our citizens as your petitioner is in duty bound will ever pray</p>
