   <p>Carlisle <date when="1864-10-08">Oct. 8. 1864</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency T. E. Bramblet Gov. of Ky,</p>
<p>Your Petitioner John Delaney says he was lately tried in the Nicholas Circuit Court to wit, at its <date when="1864-09">last September</date> Term for stabbing John Barnett in a sudden heat of passion -- and was fined the sum of $50.</p>
<p>He says the proof was that Barnett had threatened to shoot him which was the Cause of the stabbing -- The stabbing was done with a pocket knife &amp; did not inflict a Very serious wound -- </p>
<p>Your Petitioner would state that he is subject to fits which he is satisfied affects his mind &amp; Causes the least thing some times to throw him into excitement of an uncontrolable character &amp; this &amp; not the provocation he believes caused the cutting -- Barnett &amp; himself were on good terms, but ^Barnett^ was made mad by your Petitioners hitting him in the face with a snow Ball -- He says he &amp; his mother &amp; another replevied the fine but he is poor &amp; not able to pay it -- He therefore asks its remission &amp; will ever pray &amp;. -- </p>
<p>John Delaney</p>
<p>We were jurors in Delaneys case above &amp; we think the fine ought to be remitted</p>
