<lb/>Gov. Robinson
<lb/>Frankfort Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>There is confined in the penitentiary a man by the name of Milton Croply convicted for rape in the Marion Circuit Court, I have been informed recently that a petition to your Excelency is in circulation for his pardon.</p>
<p>I have not <hi rend="underline">now</hi> a distinct recollection of the evidence on the trial, but recollect that it was not sufficiently satisfactory to relieve me from some doubt as to his guilt, but according to the rules of law would not authorise me to to interfere with the verdict of the jury</p>
<p>I presume the petition will present the facts of the case, Mr Huges will be particular that none but the facts of the case are presented.</p>
<p>Permit me to say upon due consideration of the case if ^it^ comes within the range of Executive Clemency, I do not think public interest would be impaired by his release. Mr Low the States attorney at the time is in the South so that his views cannot be obtained</p>
<p>I wrote to you from Henderson enclosing a record as requested<hi rend="str"> that</hi><pb/>
<lb/><hi rend="str">of </hi>your views; but have failed so far to get a reply, and now fear you did not receive them. I would be pleased to learn if they were received</p>
<p>With high regard most
<lb/>Respectfully your Obdt Sevt
<lb/>W P Fowler</p>
