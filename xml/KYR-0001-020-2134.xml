<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>B Magoffin
<lb/>Frankfort
<lb/>Ky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I understand that an application will be made to you for the pardon of Maj Francis M. Searcy of this County, who stands indicted in our Circuit Court for the Murder of Woods S. Caperton, more than a year ago.</p>
<p>I think his case presents the very strongest grounds for your interposition Although the man he was ^so^ unfortunate as to kill in a sudden encounter, was largely and influentially connected in the town and County, Maj Searcy after a thorough and fair trial was acquitted before the examining Court triumphantly, and after this, his case was brought before the regular grand Jury empannelled for the next term, and after a thorough and searching investigation of his case, they ignored it and refused to find a bill against him either for murder or<pb/>
<lb/>manslaughter -- After these two fair and full investigations a subsequent grand Jury was empannelled and returned an indictment against him for Murder -- </p>
<p>Maj Searcy's petition fully sets forth the <hi rend="str">various for</hi> the action of this grand Jury how it was got up, and all about it, and it is therefore uneccessary for me to add to it -- It is endorsed by reliable and responsible men of our County, and my official position as clerk of the Circuit Court of this County would forbid my saying any thing further in regard to it, or Maj Searcy's case, further than to repeat that he has made out a case that loudly calls for your interposition -- </p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Your obt Servt
<lb/>J M Shackelford
<lb/>Clk Mad. Cir Court</p>
