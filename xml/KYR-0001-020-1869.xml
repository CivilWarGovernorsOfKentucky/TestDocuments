<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I defended Clark &amp; I am satisfied that he was prosecuted on account of his politicks &amp; had he been a union man he would not have been fined agreable to the proof &amp; what out side information I could git he did not sell as much as $5 worth in all &amp; so soon as he got his house completed he took out tavern licens I think the fine shuld be remited with Respect and Remaine</p>
<p>Yours Truly 
<lb/>A G Roberts</p>
