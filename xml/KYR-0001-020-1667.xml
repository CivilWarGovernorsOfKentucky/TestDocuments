   <p>His Excellency Gov. Magoffin</p>
<p>Your Petitioners Welcome Mullins and Moses Mullins respectfully represent that at the last <date when="--03">March</date> Term of the Laurel Circuit Court they were fined $15. <hi rend="underline">each</hi> upon an Indictment for disturbing religious worship -- They state that they did not attend the place of worship with any intention whatever to disturb or maltreat any one there, that the house was very much crowded, and a great many were unable to get admittance into the house, and remained out side and it happened that there were some men there who had enmity agst petitioners and who took that occassion to excite them, and they suppose their conduct was not altogether such as became them, so near where religious worship was being conducted, they say that they have respect for religious worship and it was the last thing they would have thought of doing intentionally. that they are on good terms with the members of the church and they believe that the members would be perfectly satisfied that the fines should be remitted</p>
<p>They say the times are exceedingly hard money cannot be had, and it will be impossible to pay the fines without oppression. They further say in sincerity and truth that they are truly sorry that there should ever have been any occasion to have preferred Auch a charge agst them and they pray themselves that if your Excellency will remit the fines that never shall in truth and justice be such a charge against them again</p>
<p>Welcome Mullins
