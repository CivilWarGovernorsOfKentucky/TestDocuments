   <p>Jamestown Russell County Ky
<lb/>His excellency Gov. Bramlett
<lb/>Sir:-</p>
<p>Circuit Court is in session here now and on yesterday there was a fine assessed against William F Conn for Tippling in Jamestown Mr Conn was in the imployment of one M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi>. Allo Meadows as a bar keeper understanding and believeing that his imployer had obtained Licens both state and Government for the purpose of retailing spiritous liquors but up on investigation it was acertained that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Meadows had procured Government licens but had not obtained State Licens inconsequence of which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Conn confessed Judgement for the sum of $25=which We the undersigned Citizens and friends of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Conn appeal to you to have that portion of the fine due the Commonwealth remitted upon the following grounds and reasons M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Conn is a good citizen and did <hi rend="str">not understand that</hi> ^understand^ Meadows his employer had failed to procure state licens and on account of the misrepresentation of Meadows he had been indicted and all most compelled to confess Judgment for the honest offence which is 20$ and $5 attorneys fee, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Meadows was a soldier in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Cavalry and since he left this pint for his regiment has died M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Conn is a poor man and has been afflicted in such a manner as to render him entirely unable to perform laber of any kind that would be profitable to him and he thought that he prehaps could make his expenses and a small sum to support his family if he would hire himself out to sell liquers and he is poor and if there is an object of charity in the County of Russell it certainly is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Conn therefore We the undersigned citizens think that he ought to be relieved and fell no delicacy in calling on you for<pb/>
<lb/>relief knowing that If you are satisfied from the contents of this petition that you will give him all the assistance in your power knowing at the same time you do not countenance any open violation of the Laws of the land</p>

<lb/>Dear sir</p>
<p>I can say in truth I think that the statements in the foregoing Petition are true and If you are in the habit of remiting fines of this character that you will give M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Conn the relief he seeks for in this Petition which I know you will If you remember his condition his case has certainly not been represented in the said petition as you will know spreading it from the Characters who have assigned said Petition</p>
<p>Yours with respect
