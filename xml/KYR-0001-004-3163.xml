  <body>
   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E Bramlette,
<lb/>Govenor of the State of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Dennis Veal would most respectfully present the following statement of facts and pray executive clemency He was indicted at the <date when="--02">last term of the Fayette circuit court (Feb)</date> by the grand jury of said court for horse stealing It appeared in testimony in said case that your petitioner caught the horse in the lot of D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Bayless of Fayette also taking a bridle &amp; saddle. He rode the horse a mile or two to carry some clothes to his sister after he did so he turned the horse into the pasture of a neighbor of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bayless' thinking at the time that this pasture was a portion of the Bayless farm. When D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bayless found his horse out of the pasture in which he was first turned he accosted your petitioner on the subject whereupon your petitioner immediately acknowledged that he had taken the horse for the purpose above named but with no intention of disposing of him and that he never attempted to sell the horse to any one for any sum whatever. His sole intention was to ride him to the place before mentioned &amp; to return him to his proper place. Your petitioner further states that he is unable to read or write &amp; totally unacquainted with the forms and useages in a <pb/>
<lb/>procedure in court, That he was not even sufficiently advised of such procedure as to know the inportance of engaging counsel That the court appointed counsel for him but that relying on his innocence, &amp; not knowing the propriety of it, he did not even give in the names of his witnesses Your petitioner would state that he is a poor man with an aged mother partially depending on him that he has not been long out of the United States army and was just beginning to assist her. That he appeals to your Excellency for mercy and hopes you may see fit to pardon him</p>
<p>And he will ever pray &amp;c
<lb/>Dennis Veal</p>
<p>We the undersigned in view of the facts above mentioned are in favor of the petitioners prayer &amp; recommend his as a fit subject for Executive clemency</p>
