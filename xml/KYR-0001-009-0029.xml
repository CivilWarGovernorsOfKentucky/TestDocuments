<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir:</p>
<p>Mr Jas J. Gilmore one of our citizens, and who withal is truly loyal, desires to have shipped to him here from New York some fire arms, ammunition &amp; other things belonging to his line of business. He is surviving partner of the late firm of Dickson &amp; Gilmore, who have been carrying on the Gun Making business and keeping a gun store in this City for a number of years past. He is informed, by letter from New York, (which he encloses herewith) that the goods cannot be shipped on a Military order, which he has obtained, but that a permit must be obtained from your Excellency.</p>
<p>In his behalf I respectfully ask that you will have the kindness to grant him such a permit, and enclose it ^to his address^ as soon as your convenience will permit, together with his New York letter, which he desires to file away his papers.</p>
<p>Yours very truly
<lb/>Wm Kaye, Mayer<pb/></p>
