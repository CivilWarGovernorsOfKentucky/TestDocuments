   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>B. Magoffin Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your memorialist William L. Stratton would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1861-06">June Term 1861</date> of the City Court of Louisville a Fine of Fifty Dollars was imposed against him for an assault and Battery committed upon the person of a German named Rait No defense was made by your Petitioner on the trial, the case having been called and tried whilst he was at Dinner &amp; the fine is an exorbitant one.</p>
<p>Said Rait abused Petitioner &amp; he struck him two or three light blows, &amp; the next day he was about his work &amp; exhibited scarcely <hi rend="str">any</hi> ^no^ evidence of violence. The cost with the Attorney's portion of the fine amounts to about the sum of $25. which your Petitioner thinks is ample punishment. He is almost entirely out of means &amp; does not know that he will be able to pay the cost. He is the only protection for a Widowed Mother &amp; if incarcerated in the City Work House she will loose his services. He feels bound in justice to her as well as himself to pray your Excellency that you remit the States portion of said fine- &amp; will ever pray &amp;c</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>W. L. Stratton</p>
<p>I know something of the circumstances attending Mr. Strattan's case as recited above &amp; the statements made are true as I verily believe &amp; I cordially ask your Excellency to remit his fine-</p>
<p>O S Strattan Clk C C L<pb/></p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Louisville respectfully recommend to His Excellency Gov. Magoffin a favorable consideration of the Petition of Mr. Strattan believing there is merit in the prayer of his Petitions.</p>

<p>The statements in the foregoing Petition are true. Mr Stratton is a clever Young man. The son of a Widowed Mother who is in Moderate circumstances &amp; I have no doubt they could not pay the fine without in all probability denying themselves in a great measure of the present necessaries of life</p>
