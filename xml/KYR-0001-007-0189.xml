<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>On Monday next is our Election of Directors in the Northern Bank. You will have to appoint two, and in addition the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund can vote the four hundred shares they hold in the election of the other directors. I wrote you some two weeks ago at your suggestion, recommending Wm Voorhies, and Hiram Shaw as State Directors. I could also name Charles S Bodley the Shereff as being a well qualified Director from his good sense and large acquaintance with the circumstances of the people. I am anxious to know your appointment before monday otherwise, stockholders may elect the same persons you appoint.</p>
<p>Very respectfully
<lb/>M C Johnson<pb/></p>
