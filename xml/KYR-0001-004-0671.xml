<lb/>Hon T E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Ky</p>
<p>Dear Sir enclosed with this note you will find a Petition from Henry Monkedick asking a remitance of a fine assessed against him by the Kenton Circuit Court. He is a poor man and has a large family dependant upon him for support, and has never heretofore been accused of any violation of the Law although he has been keeping a Grocery here for several years. Your Excellency will see the peculiarity of the testimony under which he was fined as certified to by the Comths Atty and by Eight of the Jurymen. He is known here as a man of truth &amp; veracity and you can weigh the fact of his denial in the Petition of the truth of the witnesses statements and give such credit as your Excellency may think proper.</p>
<p>Respectfully Yours
<lb/>James B Gray
<lb/>Atty at Law.<pb/></p>
<p>Hon Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort
<lb/>Ky</p>
