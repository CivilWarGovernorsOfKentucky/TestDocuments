<lb/>Gov. Thos. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Inclosed you will find the petition of Mrs Edna Baker and her son with the records referred to, and the affidavit of R. L. Wilson Esq and the certified of J. N. Turner the county court Judge of the county court of Caldwell county. Herein that Judge Turner acted in perfect good faith towards the petitioners, but that the Military did not. There is no evidence that my son acting in a civil capacity here took any part in the unworthy scheme to get Mrs Baker &amp; her son Leander on the Bail Bonds. The evidence however shows that the bonds were procurred by the Military giving assurances which were intended to be violated and were regions in order that Bonds might be profited and then the party Linn B Baker was in imediately sent off.</p>
<p>I have not been in the habit of petitioning for the remission of fines and forefeiturs in the course of a limited practice of 36 years, but I do think this is a case that demands the interposition of the executive to prevent a most grevious fraud and oppression.</p>
<p>Permit me to say that in <date when="1827-11">Nov 1827</date> I settled in Trigg to practice Law where I remainded over 36 years. One of my first acquaintances was Blake Baker the husband of Edna Baker and the father of the other parties. Blake Baker<pb/>
<lb/>lived long a most respectable, useful influential and honorable citizen of the county.</p>
<p>I have often partaken of Mr Baker's hospitalities and have long personally known Mrs Baker. Her character is that of a most worthy woman. I have nothing against either her or her son Leander during our troubles Given the Rebellion. The payment of the <hi rend="str">four</hi> foreitures would nearly ruin her and her son. I do not think the proud old State of Kentucky wishes to get money of old widows by such trickery; and I feel certain our high minded and efficient atty for this District would disdain the 30 per cent even if Judgment were rendered should he know all the facts. As it is he has no right to the 30 percent until Judgment is rendered.</p>
<p>I have no doubt of the truth of the facts given to by Mr. Wilson and hope that you will interpose in this case as our especially requiring it.</p>
<p>With high regard I am
<lb/>Respectfully
<lb/>C. D. Bradley</p>
<p>The Union men here coincide fully in all your public views and will stand by you in all your positions.</p>
<p>C. D. Bradley<pb/></p>
