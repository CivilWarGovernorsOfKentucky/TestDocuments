   <p>To His Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette
<lb/>Govenor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky;
<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>Your Petitioners beg leave to state that Charles Boynton is a school teacher in one of the Districts of the county. Directly after the passage of the law imposing an oath upon teachers. He being a subject of Great Britain, came to town and consulted with George W. Williams in regard to taken the oath in view of the fact of his being a subject of Great Britain. Geo. W Williams advised him not to take the oath, as he thought it would render him liable to the draft and be inconsistent with his duties as a said subject. He then designed quiting the school but his patrons and among the number your petitioner Jesse H. Boulden <unclear/> upon him to continue his school. He was indicted in Bourbon Circuit Court and fined at this term $25. He has since and more than a year ago taken the oath imposed by the legislature. He is a very poor man and has a family depending upon his labors and also a very worthy man.</p>
<p>Your petitioners therefore pray your Excellency to remit the fine imposed upon him</p>
<p>J. H. Boulden</p>
