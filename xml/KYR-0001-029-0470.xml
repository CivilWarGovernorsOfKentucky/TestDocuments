   <p>Princeton Ky <date when="1863-07-16">16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> July 1863</date>
<lb/>Govenor Robinson
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>At the last (June) term of the Caldwell Circuit Court M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> W Pickering was fined five hundred dollars on an indictment for usurpation of office. I know the circumstances under which he accepted the office of sheriff of this county under the provisional Government of Ky, he had been the former sheriff for years and the office having been vacated, and no one being found willing to accept the appointment M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Pickering was persuaded to accept, he acted untell this former sheriff was restored, and immediately surrendered the books, papers, process &amp;c to him, for his acts as sheriff as before stated and because of his Southern proclivities, he was arrested by a federal force and sent<pb/>
<lb/>a prisoner to Johnstons island, where he remained for some time and was finally discharged by the war department, after having suffered much in health and purse, he has never been connected in anyway with the Southern army, is a very peaceable and law abiding man, has a large family, and is poor, and if compelled to pay this amount it would be ruinous to him and oppressive on his family.</p>
<p>In view of all the facts I hope your Excellency will remit the fine, in so doing I Know you would but meet the wishes of the community generally</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/><hi rend="underline">G, W, Barbour</hi></p>
