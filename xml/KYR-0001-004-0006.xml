<lb/>Gov T. E. Bramlett
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>James Maloy arrested some months since for stealing 3 horses from this County, was indicted by the Grand Jury &amp; confined in Jail. In July he formed a conspiracy with several others to Break jail. He &amp; another prisoner named Barnes, since captured, &amp; convicted on a similar charge succeeded in making their escape under very agravating circumstances, for in my resisting their attented escape I was very badly injured myself.<pb/></p>
<p>not however until I had succeeded in killing one &amp; dangerously wounding another of the party. I offered a reward of $50 for his arrest, which is as much as I can afford being a poor man.</p>
<p>I now have information from the marshal of Covington that if an additional reward of $50 is offered he can be captured &amp; brought to justice.</p>
<p>Maloy is a notorious thief and is one of a gang also have been extensively engaged in Horse stealing in this region for months He should be made an example of &amp; I write to request you <pb/></p>
<p>to offer a reward of $50 on the part of the state</p>
<p>Please answer by <hi rend="str">Tele</hi> Telegraph -- </p>
<p>Most Respectfully
<lb/>W. H. Leesby
<lb/>Jailor Fayette Co</p>
