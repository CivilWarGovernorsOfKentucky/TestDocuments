Will you make <hi rend="underline">one more</hi> Effort with Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bramlett &amp; write me the result at once, that I may prepare for the worst. I have not been able to assertain what has been done with the Paper sent to M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dowell U. States Marshall, do not know ^as to Federal &amp; State courts come on the same day^ but that about the time I may prepare to appear in court here, that I may be summoned or arrested, to go to Louisville. If any <hi rend="underline">thing can</hi> done for me, will you pleas ^act for^ <hi rend="str">relieve</hi> me, that my mind (&amp; that of my wife) may be relieved. Your attention will place me under renewed obligations. With Sentiments of the highest regard your friend</p>
