   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramlette
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners Robt F Baird &amp; J. H. Price would respectfully state that on the <date when="1863-03-13">13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of march 1863</date> they went upon the Bail Bond of W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Carey to answer at the <date when="--05">may term</date> of the Jefferson Circuit Court to a charge of Grand Larceny. The bail bond was in the sum of four hundred dollars $400 00/00. At the <date when="1863-05">may term 1863</date> a forfeiture was had. At the <date when="1863-10">October term 1863</date> continued for non Service of process. At <date when="--01">January term</date> continued that petitioners might procure affidavits to show that Carey was in the United-States army: two affidavits were offered showing that he was in the army as a private soldier but they did not show that he enlisted before the forfeiture was entered in <date when="1863-05">may 1863</date>, but did show that<pb/> 
<lb/>he was a soldier before Judgment was rendered against petitioners.</p>
<p>It was admitted by the court that the affidavits placed Carey in the army but Judgment was rendered because they did not show that he was there before the forfeiture was rendered in <date when="1863-05">may 1863</date>.</p>
<p>Your petitioners bailed Carey in good faith now believe that he would have appeared had he not been detained by <hi rend="underline">Army</hi> <hi rend="underline">Regulations</hi>. He is now in the service of his Government fighting for the Union &amp; Constitution.</p>
<p>Your petitioners pray your Excellency to remit the Judgment &amp; they will ever pray</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Baird &amp; Price</p>
<p>Judgment was rendered at the <date when="1864-05">may term 1864</date><pb/>
<lb/>The statements in the foregoing petition are in accordance with the records of the court; in regard to the steps taken in the case --</p>
<p>J. R. Dupuy
<lb/>Cour Atty</p>
<p>As the man is in the army, serving his country, and the loss may ultimately fall upon him, I hope the sureties will be relieved.</p>
