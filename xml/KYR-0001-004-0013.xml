Marshall</persName> and the standing credibility of the witnesses, State that the evidence on trial consisted of the Statements alone of the prosecutor and of a boy fourteen years old ^&amp; <persName ref="cwgk:N00005032">Dr. Holland</persName>^. The prosecutor states that he lost ^on public road between <placeName ref="cwgk:P00007966">Briensburg</placeName> &amp; <placeName ref="cwgk:P00007967">Palma</placeName>^ a carpet sack containing coffee glass tumblers cottonade &amp; a pair of pants off of a wagon; that he lost said articles within <hi rend="sup">1</hi>/<hi rend="sub">2</hi> mile of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00007966">Briensburg</placeName> that distance to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00007967">Palma</placeName> is 6 miles: that he went on to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00007966">Briensburg</placeName> without delay, and discovering that Said articles were missing he immediately started back on road to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00007967">Palma</placeName> on horseback to hunt for said articles; that said Marshall &amp; boy 14 years viz witness <persName ref="cwgk:N00007931">Louis A.

<p>The boys evidence was that he was with Marshall driving the oxen &amp; that he first discovered some goods in road, cottonade &amp; tumblers; that he called to Marshall &amp; pointed him to same; that there was no carpet Sack coffee or other article except what was given up to prosecutor that a man ^on horseback^ in Soldiers uniform passed on same road before him &amp; Marshall about the time or a little before meeting prosecutor; that prosecutor did ask Marshall at Palma if he had found a Carpet Sack; and that Marshall said he had not found a carpet Sack but that he had found some goods in the road, in a bundle, and asked if they were prosecutors, &amp; prosecutor said they were. Marshall delivered the cottonade &amp; tumblers to prosecutor, who<pb/></p>
<p>said there was some coffee &amp; a carpet Sack &amp;c lost also by him; that Marshall &amp; witness boy went on to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001227">Paducah</placeName> with <hi rend="str">a</hi> ^the^ load of marketing they had at the time of finding said articles; that prosecutor never drew, cocked or showed a pistol as stated by prosecutor; and that at feed time at <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001227">Paducah</placeName>, Marshall in getting out feed for his oxen found one glass tumbler &amp; a piece of cotton goods that had got separated from the bundle found &amp; had worked down under the feed &amp; was not noticed or known at time of delivering the other articles to prosecutor; Marshall as soon as he discovered same, said there was some more of the goods of prosecutor &amp; that he did not know it before, &amp; would deliver on his return home; that when they returned home Marshall Said to his wife that Said articles belonged to prosecutor, &amp; directed her to deliver ^or send^ them to prosecutor if she had a chance; that prosecutor went to Marshalls, and Marshalls wife he being absent, Said <hi rend="str">to prose-cutor</hi> before being interrogated that there was some things there belonging to him &amp; which Mr. Marshall did not see at time the other goods were<pb/></p>
<p>delivered to prosecutor, and that Mr. Marshall had directed her to give or send them to prosecutor first opportunity. Dr. Holland stated that he went with prosecutor to Marshalls &amp; that <persName ref="cwgk:N00007933">Mrs Marshall</persName> <hi rend="str">informed</hi> made the statements as above set forth and that the boy told the same tale or in other words made the same statement then as on the trial &amp; with as little difference or variation as any man ever did. We believing Marshall ^to be^ innocent &amp; that he was convicted because of the statements of a greatly prejudicial witness would ask &amp; pray your Excellency to immediately pardon him, as in justice you should do</p>
