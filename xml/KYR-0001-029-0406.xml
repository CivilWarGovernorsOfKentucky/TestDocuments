<lb/>To his Excelency. The Govanor.</p>
<p>By permission of the keeper in charg of this Institution I address you these lines, setting forth the offence for which I was convicted -- and the course I intend to persue in the future.</p>
<p>I was tried and convicted, for two years confinement in the state's prison, at the <date when="1863-06">June term of the Kenton Co. Court in 1863</date>, on the charge of having in my posession burglers tools.</p>
<p>Those tools consisted of three brass dwelling-house keys filed in a mannor called skeletons. They ware found in the beareau drawr in the house where I was boarding in which also was found a rail-road tickett belonging to me which I had purchesd the day previous for the purpose of going home to New York.</p>
<p>Being a stranger without friends or means I could make but a feable defence, and was consequently convicted.</p>
<p>I have a good trade and am resolved when free to make an honest living, and by a proper course <hi rend="str">of</hi>I shall endeavor to wipe out the stigma that now blights my character. And that I may once more have a right to the Elective franchise as a free American Citizen. I do implore the exersise of your Executive Clemency in the granting of a pardon for my offence. </p>
<p>J. P. Walker.<pb/></p>
<p>J. P. Walker <unclear>convict</unclear> asks pardon to return him to elective franchise</p>
<p>I am informed that he is a bad man. He ought not be reinvested with the right he desires. Rejected</p>
