<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> E. Bramlette
<lb/>Govr of Kentucky</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Harrison County would most respectfully state that on the <date when="1861-07-29">29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of July 1861</date> John K. Baird a citizen of our county was arrested and brought before Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Boyd and Samuel Beard two Justices of the peace for said county -- charged with shooting at John Godman with intent to Kill. but there being no evidence against him, he was discharged -- That at an ensuing term of the Harrison Circuit Court an indictment was found by the Grand Jury against said John K. Baird, for the same offence -- That he was recognized to appear in said Court on the 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> day of its <date when="1863-05">May Term 1863</date> in the sum of Two hundred &amp; fifty Dollars -- with his father Barzilla Baird as his security. We state that the said John K. Baird in accordance with the requirements of said recognizance bond, did appear on the 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> day of the <date when="1863-05">May Term 1863</date> and delivered himself up to<pb/>
<lb/>the court for trial, but on account of other business his trial did not come off on that day -- that he returned to Court the next day &amp; was awaiting his trial, but not being <hi rend="str">able</hi> acquainted with the practice and usages of Courts he was not present in the <hi rend="underline">Court</hi> <hi rend="underline">room</hi> at the time his case was called for trial, although in town -- and the Judge would not permit the Sheriff to call him at the door and his bond was forfeited -- the Judge remitting one hundred &amp; fifty Dollars leaving one hundred Dollars for said John K. Baird and his surety Barzilla Baird to pay -- we state that said John K. Baird is here in our county <hi rend="str">the</hi> where he has been ever since the charge was brought against him -- that he has never attempted in any way to escape a trial or justice and that he is now ready and anxious to have his trial -- We state that said John K. Baird and his surety Barzilla Baird are both very poor men and that it will be very hard on<pb/>
<lb/>them, if they have to pay this bond to the Commonwealth -- and inasmuch as they have not intentionally violated the provisions of the bond, we ask your Excellency to releave them of this burden by remitting it -- </p>
<p>Respectfully --
