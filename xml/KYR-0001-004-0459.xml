<lb/>Gov Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>this letter will be handed to you by M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Hudgens, a lady of estimable charater in her neighborhood. She has the misfortune to be the mother of a son now in the penitentiary for the crime of robbery. I was of counsel for Hudgens and was thrown into considerable intercourse with him I found him a young man of intelligence &amp; learning He has evidently been well raised and his expressions of reprehension of his own crime was as vivid and I believe as genuine as a contrite heart could suggest. He I learn is<pb/></p>
<p>the only son of this lady and was he thereto been her stay and support. I should not request his dsicharge on this ground but persuaded as I am that if now pardoned he would sin no more I urge this as a strong persuasion.</p>
<p>Governor if you find your heart inclined to lean to the petition of <hi rend="str">your</hi> the mother my belief is that the future conduct of the son will justify the exercise of your kindness. I cannot say that he was not guilty but I do say that in my opinion he was operated upon by the influence of one<pb/>
<lb/>of the most wily rascals I have ever seen and in a moment of drunkeness went astray and was ruined</p>
<p>I beg to recommend M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Hudgens to your kind consideration and bespeak for her a gentle hearing</p>
<p>Respt yours
<lb/>E I Bullock</p>
