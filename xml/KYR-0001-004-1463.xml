   <p>To His Excellency Gov. Bramlette</p>
<p>The undersigned respectfully states that he has resided in Louisville Ky eleven years. He was <hi rend="str">born</hi> ^raised^ in Breckinridge County Ky; and is a Baker of bread and follows that calling for a living. He flatters himself that he is a man of good character, as good as that of any man in this City: He believes he is an industrious as any one, and he is a sober man.</p>
<p>At the same time he is free to admit that his means are very limited; having no estate and being entirely dependant on his occupation for a support for himself and wife and one child: About one year ago, The undersigned became security in a Recognizance for one Ernest Crumriegh who was charged with stealing a watch, and who was examined before the Police Court of Louisville and required to give bond in the sum of Four Hundred dollars to appear in the Jefferson Circuit Court. Crumreigh failed to appear and the bond was forfeited. The undersigned was induced to become bail for Crumreigh because he was ^a^ kin to the wife of the undersigned and nor for a fee or reward or with any hope of gain. No money or other property was deposited with the undersigned as indemnity for becoming bail. And if the undersigned is compelled to pay the amount of bail, it will be an entire loss to him without any hope of being reimbursed. The indictment charged Crumreigh with stealing a watch and that only was the offence charged. The undersigned thought the accused innocent and on that account &amp; on account of the wife of the undersigned he consented to become his bail. The undersigned<pb/>
<lb/>prays your Excellency to remit that portion of the Recognizance which belongs to the Commonwealth. Judgment on the scire facias was obtained on the <date when="1865-01">9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Jany 1865</date> in the Jefferson Circuit Court and an execution will issue thereon in a few days if your Excellency does not interpose He prays you will do so</p>
<p>Henry Koch says that the statements of the foregoing petition are true</p>
