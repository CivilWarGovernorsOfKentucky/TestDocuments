<lb/>To his Excellency 
<lb/>James F Roberson
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I am informed that John H. Stevens of this County, who was formerly a magistrate <hi rend="str">of this</hi>, has resigned his office and that his resignation has been forwarded to you, John N Shoubart of this County desires the appointment in the place of John H Stevens. I think he is well qualified for the office, a clever man, and would give general satisfaction if he was appointed. I have been presiding Judge of the county court of this county for the last four years and know pretty well who will suit the people, he is a union man and his loyalty, as far as I know, has never been questioned &amp;c</p>
