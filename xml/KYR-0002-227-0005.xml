<lb/>Hon Thos. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Gov of Kentucky
<lb/>My Dear Sir</p>
<p>On the <date when="1864-06-09">9<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Inst</date> near Acworth Geo. My health So completely broke down, from the affects of the climate, &amp; the combination of other diseases with one which has given me much trouble for Some time passed. (My condition will be better explained by surgeons certificate which you will find inclosed) While in this condition thinking I would not be able for duty for some time. I concluded rather than remain in a Geo. hospital, to hand in my resignation, &amp; ask as a favour to have it accepted immediately. But when ^I^ came back to Kingston Geo. when many of the papers of the regiment, &amp; all papers relating to ornance accounts, had been left for want of transportition. I found so much unfinished regimental buisiness, together with the ordnance buisiness, For which I was responsable. This respalability<pb/>
<lb/>being very great. For I made requisition for, &amp; by personal exertion obtained the very best of arms Spencer Rifles Revolvers &amp; Sabers together with all horse equipments for the regiment, no men need be better armed or equiped, I now find it will require me to return my position in the regiment as formerly, in order to close up the business properly. The command of the regiment has devolved on me for some months, ^passed^ Col Holman being in comd of Brig.</p>
<p>An other thing has given me much trouble a large number of the men have been dismounted, by being compelled to abandon horses which broke down from long &amp; tiresome marches over the mountains, carrying their rider his baggage &amp; rations, &amp; forrage for the horses, &amp; the want of forrage at the front, an effort is being made to keep these dismounted men up with the regiment, the effort will fail, The dismounted men must be sent to some place to do guard duty until they can all be collected together &amp; mounted I see no other way of geting the regiment together &amp; keeping it up.<pb/></p>
<p>The 11<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky Cav has done good service. While under my command. I can Say they have on serveral occasions had to face the enemy &amp; ac<hi rend="str">c</hi>quited themselves with Cr. to the regiment their State &amp; nation, I can further say I believe you have a warm friend in nearly every member of the regiment</p>
<p>I hope to get an order to place the dismounted men as I have suggested, &amp; get them remounted as soon as passable, under the circumstances I have concluded it was to the interest of the Government &amp; my duty to recall my resignation, at any rate, until these things are accomplished.</p>
<p>As I have asked to recall my resignation I respectfully request you will have no one appointed in my place.</p>
<p>Hoping all will be acceptable to you, I remain.</p>
<p>Your Friend Truly
