   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>Governor Magoffin
<lb/>Your Petitioner</p>
<p>Patsy Williams States that she is the wife of Joseph Williams; that said Williams was prosecuted in the Madison Circuit in three cases and gave three recognizances for $500 each with Thomas H Barnes, Silas Hill and James Manfield as sureties. Williams did not appear and the recognizances were forfeited.</p>
<p>The Same day the recognizances were given her husband Mortgaged his land and personalty to his sureties to indemnify them Judgements have been rendered in behalf of the Commonwealth on all of the recognizances, and they have respited by your Excellency for twelve months. This respite however is of no service to your Petitioner and her numerous children, for the reasons herein after setforth.</p>
<p>Previous to the judgement on the recognizances, the sureties prosecuted a suit in chanclry and obtained a Decree for the sale of the land and all of the personalty and the personalty was actually sold before the respite was granted, leaving her and her helpless children nothing but the land; as the Mortgage included the property exempt from Execution and the land will actually be sold notwithstanding the respite of the Commonwealth's Judgement unless that Judgement is remitted by your Excellency and your Petitioner left without house or home bread or meat.</p>
<p>Wherefore She prays your Excellency<pb/>
<lb/>to remit all of said jusgement as well against principal as sureties.</p>
