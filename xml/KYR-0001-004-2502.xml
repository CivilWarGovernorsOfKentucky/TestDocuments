   <p>Louisville <date when="1865-10-30">Octo 30 1865</date>
<lb/>Dear Govr</p>
<p>There is a case on my docket, that I candidly think deserves Executive Clemency; A Young man by the name of Mullens was Charged with felony, It was about the time of the charge made by the Legislature in the time of holding the Criminal Court, said Court meeting in Sept. instead of Octo as customary, at the <date when="--09">Sept</date> time said bond was forfeited for non appearance -- I immediately notified the party of the forfeiture, and he came at once into <hi rend="str">the</hi> Court, and stated to the Court that he was under the impression that the Court met in <date when="--10">Octo</date> instead of <date when="--09">Sept</date> that his lawyer had so informed him and he being present corroborated the fact. the Court stated that it was his business to Know the law, and refused to set aside the forfeiture, as the case stands at present there has been a forfeiture of<pb/>
<lb/>the bond and scirefacias issued returnable next term to shew cause why judgement shall not be entered: Your excellency Can set aside the whole <unclear>afit</unclear> costs and all, and I hope you will do it,</p>
<p>Dupuy was present at the time and was very much surprised at Muir adhearing to the rigid constructure of the law under the circumstances: Mullens has never appeared as if he were desirous of avoiding a trial but on the Contrary was been very diligent in procurring his witnesses</p>
