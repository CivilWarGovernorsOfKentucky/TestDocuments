<lb/>Hon Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> E Bramlette
<lb/>Gov of Kentucky
<lb/>My dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have read the petitions and statements of fact set out by Doct Jno C Willson and I have a personal knowledge that the facts Stated are True and I concur in the general principals of policy invoked in the petition. I have also read the letter of our friend F. T. Hord Esq. in which I concur and united. And allow me to assure the Govr. that the names on the petition though not numerous are all respectable men. Gentlemen of character and influence.</p>
<p>There are quite a number of youths in Kentucky who were through the influence of Jno. C. Breckinridge &amp; his <unclear/><pb/>
<lb/>who as Confederate Solders were marched into Ky. By H. Marshall in our Section, Bragg &amp; Smith in other Sections now many of these young men when in under these Commands were identified and after they left Indicted for Treason &amp; under the Statute of invading the State many Such indictments are in my correct or rather in Two or three of the countys of my circut the facts constituting the Indictment for Treason and Indict for invading the State being the Same. Now these young men have returned home having been induced to believe that when they were paroled &amp; took the Amnesty oath that they were free, but on reach home they are arrested under state charges<pb/></p>
<p>I would Suggest to Govr Bramlette the propriety of releasing all Such from state indictments. for mere political offences. There exists no charge against young Wilson of injury to the property of person of any Citizen, it is entirely a charge of Treason and Invading the State as a Confederate Soldier and no other complaint. I shall most heartily concur with you should you Grant the Pardon and remit the forfeiture asked for by Dr Jno C Willson</p>
<p>Your friend
<lb/>L. W. Andrews</p>
