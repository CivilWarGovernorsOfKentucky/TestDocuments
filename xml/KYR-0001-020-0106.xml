   <p>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> B. Magoffin</p>
<p>Being informed of an intended application to your Excellency for a commutation of the punishment of Stephen Duval, who was convicted of murder at the last term of the M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Lean Circuit Court, to confinement in the penitentiary, and having assisted Mr Maxwell, the Com<hi rend="sup">ths</hi> atty. in the prosection, and having prosecuted Duval before the Examining Court at the time of his commutment on paid charge, I have to State, that from the circumstances of the case as developed on the trial, -- it appearing that Duval <hi rend="str">was</hi> is a man of weak mind, -- almost an imbecile -- that his confederates in<pb/>
<lb/>the crime were men of intellect and strong will, that Duval was under the influence of liquor when the deed was perpetrated -- and that he was seduced into it by his confederates, Norman &amp; Baggett, I am of opinion that <hi rend="str">ends of justic</hi>e ^Justice^ would be subserved by commuting the punishment to confinement in the penetentiary for a term of year.</p>
<p>If your Excellency cannot commute without an act of the Legislature to confer the power, then I join in the petition to <hi rend="str">reprieve the execution</hi> <hi rend="str">or</hi> respite the execution until the Legislature shall assemble</p>
