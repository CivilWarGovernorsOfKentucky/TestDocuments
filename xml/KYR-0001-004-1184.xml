<lb/>Wilhelm did not know of the change in the time of holding the Court or he would have been present he is a peasible quiet good man and he therefore asks that you Releive him from the payment of the Bond </p>
<p>I am my Dear Sir your Friend

<lb/>R S Ratcliffe
<lb/>Attorney for
<lb/>John Wilhelm</p>
<p>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Bramlette -- Mr Ratcliff his truly stated his case and as I have become familliar with it since I came into office I regard it was working a hardship on Wilhelm and cheerfully recommend the remission of the bond as an act of Justice in fact I see now no cause why payment should be exacted -- there can be no doubt of his intentions to have been present to his trial ^&amp;^ except ^for^ the change in holding the courts mislead him he would have been on hand</p>
<p>Yours &amp;C
