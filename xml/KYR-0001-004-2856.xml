   <p>Maj Joseph L Frost, as I am informed having been indicted, on evidence given by me ^&amp; others^ to the Grand Jury of Fayette County several months since, and acted upon last month by the Grand Jury, I therefore make the following statements</p>
<p>About the first to middle of April last last I had stolen from my pasture a grey horse and was informed he was on the farm ocupied by Maj Frost. In two or three days after receiving the information I sent my Son to see about him who reported having seen a grey horse on the premises but was not mine. My information beyond what is above stated would not be regarded as evidence it being only statements made by others to me. The above facts I affirm as true to the best of my recolection. P, Henry, Thomson Esq<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi></p>
<p>I have known Maj. Frost from early childhood and so favourably that no ordinary evidence would be sufficient to impress me with beleaf in his being other than an honest man
