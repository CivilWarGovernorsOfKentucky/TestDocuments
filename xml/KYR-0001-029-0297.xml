   <p>Franklin County
<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Gov. Robinson -- </p>
<p>Your petitioner respectfully states as follows: For <hi rend="str">nearly</hi> two years past a prosecution has been pending in the Circuit Court against him for selling less than a quart of liquor after his license expired. He was at the last term just ended, fined $50 -- Since the offence, he has never sold liquor to any one, nor violated the laws in any way. He hopes never to do so. It is proper perhaps to say that he was not fined for his own act, but for that of one of his sons.</p>
<p>He has no trade. He has a wife and Seven children -- all small except one who enlisted in the army -- has been discharged on account of a six months attack of chronic diarrhea -- will be dependant on him for support.</p>
<p>All the property he has will not bring the fine and costs, if sold.</p>
<p>He is dependant on his daily work for support which in these troubled times is hard to obtain regularly. He prays for a remission of the fine. Witness W L Harlan Newton ^his X mark^ Dean</p>
