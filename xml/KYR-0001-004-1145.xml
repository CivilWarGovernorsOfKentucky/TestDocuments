<lb/>Hon. M. M. Benton
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>For the last few days we have had considerable excitement in our town growing out of the attack which the copperheads made on your character charging you with everything but being a Union man. They Said you was a rebel at the commencement of the rebellion, and on the arrival of the news of our defeat at Bull Run You Said you went into the Country to shout and have more Room to throw up your hat, and rejoice<hi rend="str">d</hi> at the defeat of the Union Army, and in order to Save your Self from being arrested you joined the Abolition party and now
<lb/>^was^ one of the most violent Lincoln men in the State. I had to meet these charges against you by a Statement of the personal knowledge I had of your character and denounce them as falsehoods, and I think I was Successful in placing you right before this community. -- I had made an arrangement in the County to Secure to you a majority of the votes, and our friends were making arrangements for the battle which was to have come off on this day, On Saturday evening we received information from one of our friends who came down from Danville that Gen Burge had issued an order to all the Sheriffs in this District not to Suffer any pole to be opend in any<pb/>
<lb/>of the counties for the Hon Mr Duval as he ^had^ expatriated himselfe (according to his own decision), by uniteing himself with the rebels by going off with Braggs Army when he was in Ky, You may well amagine the cruel disappointment of your kind friends (the Copper heads &amp; rebels) which was manufactured by them in angry denunciations against Gen B, who had interfered with their Sacred priveledges but the <hi rend="underline">hunt</hi> was out <hi rend="underline">and they</hi> <hi rend="underline">had</hi> to <hi rend="underline">Submit</hi> All they could do was not to vote themselves and get as many as they could to follow their example</p>
<p>On Yesterday evening they Sent down Some<pb/>
<lb/>tickets having the name of Jude Robertson announced as their Candidate but this would not take with the people for they did not beleive that he authorized them to use his name, and thus you see the wicked were Caught in their own net, In consequence of their being no opposition to the candidate for sheriff in the county and the copper heads &amp; rebels not voting and it being a busy time in our county their was but a very Small vote polled in the County -- I think your vote will be from 300 to 250 votes. Permit me to congratulate you on your election. Give my kind regards to Mrs Benton.</p>
<p>Yrs Truly
<lb/>J L Linedly</p>
