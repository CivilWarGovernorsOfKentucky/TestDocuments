   <p>To his Excellency Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioners citizens of Eastern Ky would respectfully represent that during the late rebelion Eastern Ky has suffered all the horrors of a civil war</p>
<p>We would further represent that the courts of said portion of the state are overrun with indictments &amp; prosecutions growing out of the late war that if said Indictments are tried that in some counties it would require not less than two months to dispose of the commonwealth docket alone &amp; amount as we believe <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> in the acquital of all those Indicted for matters growing out of the war, thus running the state to a vast amount of expense &amp; her officers to great labor resulting in nothing but expense to the state and depriving litigants in Civil actions from obtaining trials to the great injury to the<pb/>
<lb/>whole of the good citizens &amp; civil citizens of our community-</p>
<p>We ask that all those indicted for matters growing out of the war be pardoned-</p>
