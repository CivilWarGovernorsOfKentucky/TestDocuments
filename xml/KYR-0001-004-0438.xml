<lb/>To his Excellency,
<lb/>The Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>In the fall of <date when="1861">1861</date> an organization was formed in this place styling itself the provisional Government of Kentucky: with the formation of which I refused to have anything to do. But some weeks after its formation I was solicited by Geo. W. Johnson, Esq. then acting Governor of said organization to accept the appointment of Auditor pro tempore until the the person who had been previously appointed to fill that office and who was then in a distant part of the State, should arrive. I consented to do so and did so act for several weeks in the daily expectation of being relieved from a position that I had accepted more as a personal favor to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Johnson than from a wish to oppose the Government of the State. In so doing however, I am sensible that I committed a grave offense against the laws of Kentucky and desire the interposition of executive clemency in my behalf.</p>

<p>we know Mr. Pillsberry the petitioner, very well, &amp; have no hesitation in saying his statements are entitled to full credit. We therfore write with him &amp; respectfully pray that a pardon be extended to him</p>
