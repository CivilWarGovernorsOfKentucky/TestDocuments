<lb/>Your Excellency.</p>
<p>I have understood that the friends of the notorious guerrilla Col. Bob. Martin, now in the Military Prison at this place are trying to secure your recommendation to the President to pardon said Martin. In March last this Martin entered this city (then a garrisoned post) in disguise and stole from my stables two fine horses One of these horses I have reason to believe is still in his posession under his control, yet he refuses to give any information in regard to him, but maintains a saucy, brazen and defient air when spoken to on the subject Can this be considered these "<unclear>fruits meet</unclear> for repentance", which should proceed the reception of executive Clemency? I cannot think that with a knowledge of these facts he can have your countenance in his efforts -- </p>
