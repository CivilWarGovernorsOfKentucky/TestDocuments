<p>At this place there came into the Coach a woman with four small children. The children were crying with hunger. The Mother said that neither she nor her children had tasted a mouthful of food that day (past noon) I bought some food before we started, when we got to the hotel, had them stop &amp; gave them all a dinner, I gave her ten dollars in money. She was entirely destitute. This woman was the widow of John White of the 3<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> Ky,, Cavly,, Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Bramlette's regiment. He, White died in the Service. The rebels had destroyed evrything at M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Vernon, her home &amp; even shot her cow, while she was milking it. some of the balls passing through her dress, &amp; one wounding her little girl in the shoulder as I could see by the scar.</p>
