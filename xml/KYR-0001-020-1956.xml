<lb/>His Excy B. Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Mr. Harris sends his Petition for remission of fine against young Mr. Hand for retailing liquor to Soldiers= I have read Mr. Harris Petition and he relates the matter of the action of the Grand Jury and the part I performed as Co Atty pretty substantially= From what passed by myself while I was called before the Grand Jury and from what was said by the Jury and from what was done by the Town Trustees at the time of whose Board I was one I was myeslf surprized that any Indictments were returned against Mr. Hand &amp; others= The law was then a new one and great numbers of Soldiers about town rendered it next to impossible to vend liquors to any body without selling also to the Soldiers and in order to accommodate all parties it was agreed by the Trustees with Mr. Harris and others Tavern keepers that if they would close up and not sell any more for a time that they the Trustees would not order me as Co Atty to prossecute them This was submitted to Mr. Harris and others and I know that he ceased selling under that<pb/>
<lb/>arrangement and I have no doubt that Mr. Harris regarded it as a matter entirely gone by and forgotten under the general understanding= I was surprized myself that any Indictments are found against them= By military orders he and others could not vend for a considerable time under their license= I therefore hope your Excy may remit the fine </p>
<p>Respectfully yours
<lb/>Thos. C. Woods</p>
