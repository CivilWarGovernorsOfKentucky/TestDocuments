<p>Since you came to Ky no authority has been given to recruit. Before you came, authority to raise companies in various Exposed localities had been given, and some few of these companies have been armed. Col Taylor was authorized to raise a Regt but has never reported any thing done. I have been waiting for your plan of defence so as to adopt it. My desire is to organize the militia so as to have basis of local defence and have none but Federal troops for the General service in the State All State troops will be subject your orders, if such plan be adopted by you or the War Dep<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. But I prefer having them mustered into U S service so as to relieve the state of the expense.</p>
