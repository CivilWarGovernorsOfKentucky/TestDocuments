   <p>State of Kentucky
<lb/>County of Baren</p>
<p>To his Excelency Thomas E Bramlet Governor of said state at Frankfort.</p>
<p>Your petitioners show to your Excellency that Sidney Young was indicted at the <date when="1865-03">March Term 1865</date> of the Baren circuit court and tried and convicted for the crime of Arson and sentenced to five years confinement in the state Penetentiary. They show that said Young is only about Eighteen Years old up to this time he has sustained a good character for honesty industry sobriety &amp; morality; no charge of vice or immediately ever having previously been made against him. His parents are also of the very highest respectability and reside in our immediate neighborhood in this county &amp; we have known the defendant from his childhood. On the day the offence was committed he was induced to &amp; did drink too much spirits and was very drunk when he went to the house of one Preston wade &amp; have a fight with a negro and threw several things in the fire which was burning &amp; from which it appeared the house took fire. He was a stranger to wade &amp; his family had no malice at him and only a hole in the floor was burned. In consideration of his Extreme Youth &amp; previous good character we respectfully Yet earnestly recomend him to Executive clemency and ask your Excellency to pardon him</p>
