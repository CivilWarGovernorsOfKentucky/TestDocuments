Thereupon said Howard was released from confinement and the petitioner forthwith proceeded to Owensboro. and then and there made an offer of Said Howard as a substitute as aforesaid, and he was rejected. on the ground that he had been a <hi rend="underline">soldier</hi> in the <hi rend="underline">So</hi> <hi rend="underline">Called</hi>. <hi rend="underline">Confederate</hi> <hi rend="underline">Army</hi> This petitioner was told to take said Howard to Louisville that it was probable he would be rec<hi rend="sup">d</hi><pb/>
<lb/>there. but that he (the Officer at Owensboro.) was not authorized to receive him: This petitioner proceeded immediately to Louisville. and there made an offer of said.

<p><hi rend="str">ation of the vast</hi>Now in consideration of the vast expenses of Travel to put Howard into the Service as a Substitute, and the amount actually paid for a Substitute to answer the call of his country, and the further fact that petitioner is now an must be the entire looser. and which will greatly distress and embarass this petitioner, he being <hi rend="underline">poor</hi> and unable to pay without great inconvenience In consideration of the premises.
