<lb/>His Excellency B. Magoffin -- 
<lb/>Dr Sir -- </p>
<p>At the present term of this Court (Kenton Circuit) Nevilla Timberlake was convicted of the crime of Embezzlement and his punishment fixed by the jury at Eighteen months in the state prison -- </p>
<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Green Clay Smith has detailed the facts substantially as they appeared on the trial.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Smith and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Mooar of Our fine defended the young man on the trial before the jury.</p>
<p>We believe that the case of this young man presents strong considerations for the interposition of executive clemency. He is quite young not now above Seventeen or eighteen years old. and the evidences of interest of his father in the money embezzled mittigate our judgment the criminailty of the offense. The young man was<pb/>
<lb/>bereft of his mother in early infancy and his father has been perhaps two indulgent to his somewhat wayward son.</p>
<p>The father of the youth, W. D. F. Timberlake bears this note to you. He gives his faith that he will remove his son hence so that he shall not again trouble the criminal Courts of the state, if it shall be your pleasure to pardon him.</p>
<p>We take pleasure in testifying to our confidence that he will be true to his engagement to remove his son from the state and believe he will so situate him that he will not touble us again.</p>
<p>He is yet young enough to be reclaimed by a proper couse of tutelage, which he will not be likely to find within the walls of the state prison.</p>
<p>Should you grant our request in this matter you will place us under renewed personal obligations, and we know the father will be thereby placed under conditions of lasting gratitude.</p>
<p>We ask it with a Concious belief that no Detriment will result to the<pb/>
<lb/>public interest by his release -- </p>
<p>We have not thought it expedient to present a long list of Petitioners which we might do but which would not enlighten your Excellency on the facts now influence your judgment on the propriety of according to our request -- </p>
<p>Yours Respectfully</p>
<p>J. O'Hara Jr
