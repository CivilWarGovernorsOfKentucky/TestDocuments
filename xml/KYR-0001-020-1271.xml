<lb/>Hon Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the request of the suffering family of Joseph Blackwell who was convicted at the last term of Circuit Court for this county and fined $200 <hi rend="sup">00</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi> for keeping a Tipling house I address you these few lines. From my knowledge of the man and from all the information I can obtain concerning him I beleive it would be not only an act of well directed clemency but of charity to remit his fine. he has a family consisting of a Wife<pb/>
<lb/>and two small children, all dependant upon him for support, he has no money. to pay his fine and if it should not be remitted he will have to serve it out in Jail, to no benefit to himself or to the Commonwealth.. he is a man of Excellent character sober industrious and well behaved. I believe your excellency would do an act of charity to remit the fine</p>
<p>Yours Respectfully
<lb/>John A Goodson</p>
