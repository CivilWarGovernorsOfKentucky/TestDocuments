<lb/>Gov Bramlett</p>
<p>Sir the undersigned citizens of the County of Christian beg leave to make the following statement. and pray your Honors interposition for the benefit and relief of one of our county men who has unintentionally as we believe violated the Law of our State,,</p>
<p>The Grand Jury, returned a Bill against George W Braun for Keeping a Tipling house in the town of Bainbridge in this county, upon the trial it appeared that Braun was a Grocer and had obtained license as such. Persons buying Liquor would step out the building and drink in the yard or adjacent to the Grocery. for this offence Braun was fined Sixty Dollars the Sheriff has the claim for collection.</p>
<p>We are personally acquainted with G W Braun and beg to state respectfully. that he Braun is a very poor but industrious citizen and is unable without great loss and injury to himself and Family to pay said fine. We therefore most respectfully and urgently reuqest your Honor to interpose and relieve our neighbour &amp; Friend from so much of the fine as is in the power of the Executive</p>
