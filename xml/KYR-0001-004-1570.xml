<lb/>to take delight in Prosecuting such cases</p>
<p>Respectfully your Obedient

<p>Gallatin Cir Ct
<lb/>vs
<lb/>Walter Brown Jr<pb/></p>
<p>We the subscribers heartily Join in the prayer of the Petiioner and respectfully request that his fines be remitted and pardoned in advance as it can do no good and probably much harm to fine so young an Individual and one of Respectable Parents</p>
