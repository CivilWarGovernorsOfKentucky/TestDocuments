<lb/>Gov B Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Some days ago, a petition from Martin Hoover to you was sent by mail Asking to be released from the Jail of Kenton county where he was confined for thirty days &amp; fined fifty dollars by a Jury of his county under the charge of assaulting a German woman with intent to commit on her a rape It may be you have not had time to attend to it or laid the papers aside &amp; the whole thing escaped your memory If I am correct in either of these suppositions. I hope you<pb/>
<lb/>will not consider this an intrusion upon your time or patience. I believe the case of Hoover is one that deserves your favorable consideration. The facts are contained in the petition &amp; other papers accompaning it. I will direct your special attention the statement of Mr Arthur the Commonwealths Atto on the morgin of the petition The man has already suffered more I beleive than is commensurate with his guilt. He is an expense to the county. &amp; is not paying his fine by being in Jail. &amp; he cant get the money possibly to do it.<pb/>
<lb/>I would have gotten more letters &amp; names but I support a plain statement if the facts all that is necessary &amp; hope you will feel it your duty to releive this man. &amp; place him in a condition to do something for his family which at this time is so much needed</p>
<p>Yours &amp;c
<lb/>R Simmons</p>
<p>Gov B Magoffin</p>
