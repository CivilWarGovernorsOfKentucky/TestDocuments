<lb/>Dear Governor,</p>
<p>At the present term of the Mason Circuit Court, G. H. Wilkinson was fined and imprisoned six months for cutting in a sudden affray, and without malice, a man named Hall, A petition has been sent you to remit the <hi rend="str">p</hi>imprisonment, He had previous to his conviction been confined for about four months, and since conviction has been in prison near a month, He is not a bad man, and has an <unclear/> and dependant family, who are suffering for want of his assistance, I hope you will send him a pardon so far as the remainder of his <hi rend="str">pun-</hi>imprisonment may be released,</p>
<p>If we had <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>known of the law passed by the late legislature, giving<pb/>
<lb/>jury the right to fine <hi rend="underline">or</hi> imprison, I do not believe the jury would have found a verdict of imprisonment</p>
<p>Yours respectfully
<lb/>R H Stanton</p>
<p>Hon B. Macgoffin<pb/></p>
<p>Petitin<figure type="hr"/>
<lb/>Remitted
