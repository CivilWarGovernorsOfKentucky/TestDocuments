<lb/><date when="1863-05-20">May 20 1863</date>
<lb/>Hon J. F. Robinson, Governor &amp;c,</p>
<p>During my official term as Commonwealths' Attorney for this District, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> W. P. Clayton was fined in the Mason Circuit court, in two cases, each for $200., for suffering gaming on his premises, The cases were both respited for 12 months, and capias have now issued upon them. Mr Clayton was at the time these fines were imposed, the keeper of a house of public entertainment, and I think it may be safely said, that his good nature alone is to blame for the offense, as he could not resist the conduct of his guests who played on his premises. He is a man of very upright character, is not now keeping public house, is very poor, of feeble constitution, and has really been very sick for some months, and is now quite ill.<pb/> 
<lb/>He is not able to pay these fines, <hi rend="str">or</hi> and it would endanger his life to send him to jail. I therefore most respectfully ask that you will remit them, or so much thereof as you may have it in your power to do,</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>R, H, Stanton</p>
<p>I unite with Mr Stanton in asking for the reasons above stated, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Clayton's fines be remitted,</p>
<p>Henry L. Jefferson
<lb/>Sheriff of Mason ,Co.<pb/></p>
<p>R. H. Stanton asks the remission of W. P. Claytons fines</p>
