<p>Stanley D. Bowers states, that he has been intimately acquainted with Thomas B. Wadlington for the last nine years, and he knows his general Moral character, and he states, that his character is that of an honest correct and peacable citizen and such is, and has been his character among his neighbors, and acquaintances generally. He further states, that he is acquainted with the character of M. A. Cartwright dec<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> and he states, that said Cartwright was considered in his neighborhood (up to the time of his death) a dangerous, quarrelsome, and disorderly young man. and he states, that from his Knowledge of all the parties, and the circumstances connected with the Killing, he does verily believe that the evidence as given by Prince and Blalock was untrue, and he does believe, that the verdict of the Jury does manifest injustice to said Wadlington. He does verily believe that the Killing was in necessary self-defence. He further states from the general moral character of James Blalock he does not believe that he is entitled to credit as a witness in a court of Justice.</p>
