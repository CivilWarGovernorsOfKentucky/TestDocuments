<lb/>had me arrested &amp; tried for selling the candy &amp; ^the^ court fined me five Dollars &amp; cost which was aboute as much &amp; as my Scanty means will not justify my giving that a way I ask you if you can remit the whole of it as it was done through malace the court all Say that if this will not do that thay will all <hi rend="str">s</hi> sine a petision to have it remited as ninetenths of the <hi rend="str">wole</hi> whole place will do the same the court thinks this will be the better plan as they donot want it known who had a hand in it your ^early^ complyance to this ^will^ greatly oblige your old friend</p>
