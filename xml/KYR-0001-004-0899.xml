   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned your petitioner would state: that he was indicted in Clark Circuit Court for carrying concealed a pistol and gave bond for his appearance and at the <date when="--05">present May term</date> was tried, and clearly acquitted. There was in fact, never any show of a case against him, and he was always, anxious and urgent for a trial, But at the <date when="1862-11">November Term 1862</date>, his bond for appearance was forfeited and <hi rend="underline">judgment rendered</hi> <hi rend="str">rendered</hi> on the forfeiture, and execution is now issued on said judgment.- He says that said forfeiture was had <hi rend="underline">through a mistake</hi>, and through ignorance, he knew nothing of my Judgment on it until execution had issued ^nor did his counsel^. He says he was never absent at any <hi rend="underline">time</hi> of the Clark Circuit Court after he was indicted, was always present arguing a trail, and the forfeiture occurred in the hurry and confusion of business. He asks Executive clemancy as his only chance to aproximate to Justice</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">James Williams</hi></p>
<p>Sworn to by James William before me this <date when="1864-05-03">3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> of May 1864</date>- </p>

<lb/>For A. H. Buckner Clk<pb/></p>
<p>We are counsel for James Wlliams in the case refered to, and believe his sworn statements to be true, we know he was always present and ready for trail, and that the forfeiture was through some mistake, there was scarcely a shaddow of a case against him.</p>
<p>M. H. Huston
<lb/>Cha<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Eginton</p>
<p>I was a witness for James Williams in the case named herein, and <hi rend="underline">know</hi> that the forfeiture of his bond was wrong and said Williams was always present at the courts after he was indicted.</p>
