   <p>Mercer County Sct
<lb/>To the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Thos Edwards states he is County Judge of Mercer County that James Lawson is indicted in the Mercer Circuit Court for feloniously murdering one "<hi rend="underline">Bud</hi>" Bosley &amp; has fled from justice &amp; is now running at large to the great terror of the good citizens of this Commonwealth</p>
<p>The killing of Bosly by Lawson was without any provocation whatever &amp; was in law &amp; fact a most outrageous murder -- Lawson is a desperado who defies all law civil &amp; military</p>
<p>The ends of justice cannot be satisfied without his arrest which cannot be accomplished without a reward of at least the full amount authorized by law being offered -- Peace has come but order cannot be restored till those who are lawbreakers are made to feel the penalties of the Law. I most humbly but most earnestly petition<pb/>
<lb/>Your Excellency to offer a reward of Five Hundred Dollars for the apprehension of this despeate outlaw &amp; his delivery to the Jailer of Mercer County to answer this most flagrant Murder -- &amp; as in duty bound will ever pray &amp;<hi rend="sup">c</hi></p>
<p>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Edwards
<lb/>Presiding Judge of Mercer County</p>
<p>Reward of $300.
<lb/>Jas Lawson for murder of Bud Bosley
