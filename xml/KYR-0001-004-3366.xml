   <p>To His Excellency Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Govr State of Kentucky</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Warren County and living in the neighborhood of William Stagner, who was at the <date when="--02">February Term</date> of the Warren Circuit Court, sent to the penitentiary for receiving Stolen property - having learned that a petition has been sent to your excellency requesting a pardon of the said Stagner - take this <unclear>prudent</unclear> of entering our protest against your exercise of any clemency in his behalf - for his character in the neighborhood is very bad - and we think he justly deserves the punishment awarded to him and hope for the sake of good morals, law - and the neighbors that he will be required to serve his <hi rend="underline">full</hi> Term in the state prison</p>
