<lb/>Gov Bramlette</p>
<p>Dr Sir -- I believe I gave the Notes of the Examining Judge in the case against Skeene &amp; James to old Mr Skeene &amp; he has not returned them. My <hi rend="underline">recollection</hi> of the cases against the two men is as follows -- Both were indicted jointly for Robbery committed in this city on the same night -- they plead guilty to one of the indictments &amp; not guilty to the other, stating that they were not in the city but <hi rend="underline">one</hi> night; that on which the first charge was laid -- <hi rend="underline">Both indictments had not then been seen by their counsel</hi>. If I remember rightly skeene rifled the pockets demanded the money &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi> James standing by, they they were to gather all evening from dark till after 12 M -- When they saw Policeman walking up towards them, they immediately ra<hi rend="str">nn</hi>n (one of the men<pb/> 
<lb/>robbed was with the Policemen) Both plead guilty in one case &amp; as to the facts in the other, the jury did not hesitate, but I believe that Skeene seemed to be the leader of the two. This is about all I remember of the cases</p>
<p>Resptfly <hi rend="underline">J R Dupuy</hi></p>
<p>P S The bearer of this has just handed me Judge Johnsons notes of the case (only one of them) which I gave to old Mr Skeene &amp; on it I find a memorandum which I wrote in pencil in sending it for Judge Muirs inspection It will be better understood when Your excellency learns, that the parties were held over in the court below in one case only, but the Grand Jury, having evidence of two robberies found two bills -- the robberies were on the same night, &amp; in the same part of the city, one was proven &amp; the other admitted. There were no notes taken in but one case, both were much alike Dupuy</p>
