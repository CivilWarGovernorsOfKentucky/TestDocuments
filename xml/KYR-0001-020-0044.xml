<lb/>Hon B. Magoffin Gov of Ky
<lb/>Dear Sir &amp; friend.</p>
<p>You have a petition before you of Thomas B. Wadlington of caldwell Co Ky. to be pardoned ^&amp; released^ from a Judgment of death rendered in the Caldwell Circuit Court -- I would take the liberty to suggest to you that the Extension of your Excecutive Clemency to him will, in my Judgement be a meritorious and merciful act. I have known him long, to be a law abiding -- honest peaceful citizen -- I am fully satisfied that Justice has not been <hi rend="str">given</hi> done in his case. The facts were not presented in a fair, truthful manner &amp; the instructions of the court were wrong in many particulars -- I earnestly<pb/>
<lb/>ask of your Excellency favor to my friend &amp; hope for his full pardon &amp; a restoration to life, family &amp; friends -- I remain</p>
<p>Your friend &amp; obt Servt
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Willis G Hughes</hi></p>
