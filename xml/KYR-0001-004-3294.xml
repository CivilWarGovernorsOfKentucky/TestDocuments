   <p>To His Excellency Thomas E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned petitioners would Respectfully represent to Your Excellency That Daniel Steel a citizen of Whitley County Ky. was at the <date when="--03">March Term</date> of the Laurel Circuit Court, tried in Said Court on the charge of Felony, and convicted and sentenced to two years confinement in the State Penitentiary where he is now in pursuance thereof confined-</p>
<p>We citizens of Laurel County where the offense was committed and the trial had, some of us having heard the trial before the Court, all of us being well acquainted with the facts of the case, concur in stating to Your Excellency, our belief that State was not <hi rend="underline">Morally</hi> guilty of <hi rend="underline">Felony</hi> That attempt we believe the Jury who tried the case, honestly discharged what they conceived to be their duty under the law nevertheless at the time and place of the trial a very high prejudice pervaded the public mind, growing out of the turbulent condition of society, incident to our war troubles; That a very high prejudice existed in the public mind, (perhaps justly founded) with regard to some men of bad character and lawless habits in Steele's immediate neighbourhood- which we think improperly attached to Steele, In view therefore of all these facts, we concur in the opinion that it is a case demanding Executive Clemency, That Your Excellency would be but Subserving the ends of public Justice in granting Steele an immediate pardon to Steele.</p>
