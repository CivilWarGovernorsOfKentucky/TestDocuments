Your petitioner fother says that he was confined in the Jefferson County Jail for <gap/> months, which together is more then three years. Imprisonment alreddy suffered for a Crime of which your petitioner Sollemly declares he never was guilty, but was convicted through the prejudicial influance from certain officials in the capasaty of watchman: But your petitioner respectfully submits that even if he had been guilty that the majesty of the law <hi rend="str">has</hi> <hi rend="str">he</hi> would have been fully vindicated.</p>
<p>Your petitioner would fother state that he has conducted himself well from his boyhood up as also ever since his confinement in said Penitentiary, and that if it is true<pb/>

<p>We the undersigned Citizens of Louisville would suggest that we believe the above is a case which deserves the interference of Your Executive Clemency, and we therefore pray that your Excellency will grant him his parden;</p>
