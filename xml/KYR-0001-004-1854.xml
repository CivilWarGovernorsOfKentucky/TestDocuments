   <p>Caldwell County Kentucky</p>
<p>The affiant Enoch Hooper states that he is a citizen of Caldwell County Kentucky &amp; that he has been for many years &amp; that Chas, Hooper who is Indicted in three several cases in the Caldwell Circuit Court for Robbery is a son of this affiant, and affiant further states that in the Summer of <date when="1861">1861</date> a man by the name of Pierce recruited a company in this County for the Rebel army, &amp; the accused Chas, Hooper joined said Company in violation of the wishes of this affiant and affiant states that the accused Chas, Hooper remained in said company until the battle at Fort Donaldson in <date when="1862">1862,</date> when the accused became seperated from his command, and the accused then enlisted in a Ky Rebel Reg. commanded by one Thos. Woodard, &amp; belonged to said Reg. at the time the Robbery was committed for. which the accused stands Indicted in the Caldwell Circuit Court. &amp; affiant states that said Woodard's Reg. was soon disbanded and then the accused went &amp; joined his old Regiment (the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> Ky Reb. Cavalry) and remained in it up to the battle at Paducah in <date when="1864">1864,</date> when the accused deserted the Reb, Gen, Forrest. went to Louisville took the Amnesty oath and has been within the Federal lines since that time, And this affiant states that the reason said Chas, Hoppoer does not return<pb/>
<lb/>is oweing to the pendancy of the said Indictments in said Court against him &amp; the fear of the accused does not arise from his conciousness of guilt -- but the accused is &amp; so is this affiant a poor man and not able to bear the expences incident to a Criminal prosecution for this reason &amp; this alone that the accused does not return to his home, but as before stated the accused has been within the Federal lines since <date when="1864-03">March 1864</date> but affiant states in addition that not withstanding the great expense incidental to said trials, &amp; the poverty of the accused, the accused would have given bond &amp; stood his trial but was affraid at the time he returned of being conscripted by some roveing band of Rebels &amp; his ^bonds would have been taken as forfeited^</p>
