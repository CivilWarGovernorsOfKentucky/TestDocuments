<p>The second case the proof on the part of the state showed that Dft sold Liquor by the drink some six months previous to the trial Dft filed his Licens to keep a Coffee House from the city and allso from the Government<pb/>
<lb/>and should by proof that at the time his application for said Licens were pending before the General Council of said City he had sold Liquor by retail notwithstanding the proof the Jury found petitioner Gilty and found him as aforesaid to wit the first case $100.00 and the second case sixty petitioner has paid one hundred and fifteen dollars on said Fines he would respectfully pray your Excellency to remit the remainder of said fines</p>

<p>Under the circumstances I think the remaining portions of the fines $45 should be remitted</p>

<p>The Petitioner, John McBride is an industrious man, &amp; poor. There was some ill feeling manifested by some neighbors against him, in the procescution of the cases mentioned in the Petition. Cases frequently, occur now, in our city, when good men, are deceived by the false representations of <hi rend="underline">bad women</hi>, who represent themselves to be the wives of soldiers &amp; <hi rend="underline">now</hi> I have every reason to believe, that Mr McBride was imposed on and as soon as he found out the true chracter the women who had rented some rooms from him he Ejected them by lawful means, I respectfully Join with him in the his petition</p>
