   <p>Georgetown Ky, <date when="1862-04-15">Apr 15. 1862</date>
<lb/>Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Magoffin 
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the <date when="1854-03">March Term 1854</date> of the Scott Circuit Court Jordan, a slave, then belonging to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> R M Erving was tried upon an indictment for the murder of another slave, and was found guilty of manslaughter. The punishment was commuted by Gov. Powell, to imprisonment for life in the penitentiary, where the slave has been ever since, <hi rend="str"><unclear/> <unclear/> <unclear/></hi></p>
<p>After such a lapse of time it could not be expected that either of the undersigned, (one of whom was the presiding Judge, and the other, counsel of the prisoner) would be able to state with accuracy or in detail, the facts of the case as proved on the trial. We do remember, however, the leading features of the case and can now state, that although accending to strict law, the proof may perhaps sufficient to make out a case of manslaughter, yet, if the prisoner had been a free white citizen of respectible standing, it would have been a fair case <hi rend="str">of</hi>for acquittal. The persons composing<pb/>
<lb/>the jury are among our most respectable citizens, and although they felt constained to render the verdict they did, they were actively instrumental in procuring the commutation of the punishment</p>
<p>In view of the nature of the case, of of the long confinement of Jordan, and of the character he has sustained both before and since his conviction, we do not hesitate to request that your Execllency would exercise in his favor the power of pardon as now provided by law. </p>
<p>Very respectfully &amp;c
<lb/><hi rend="underline">A. Duvall</hi>
<lb/><hi rend="underline">J F Robinson</hi><pb/></p>
<p>Slave of Dr Erving of Scott Co -- 
<lb/>(Jordan) -- </p>
<p>Issue Pardon under recent act of Legislature in the two cases refered to</p>
