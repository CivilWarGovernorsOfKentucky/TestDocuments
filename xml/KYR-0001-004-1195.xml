   <p>To the Honorable, Thomas E. Bramlette, Governor of Kentucky,</p>
<p>Your petitioner, James C. Brookover would respectfully represent unto your Honor, that on the <date when="1864-05-28">28<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day of May 1864,</date> he was fined by the Mayor of the City of Maysville the sum of seventy five dollars and costs ^for breach of the peace and^ for resisting the Deputy Marshall of said city in the execution of process under the following circumstances, said officer had a summons against this petitioner for some violation of some market ordinance, requiring him to appear before the Mayor at an hour designated in said warrant, which process was duly served by said functionary, this petitioner feeling himself aggrieved by the conduct of said officer in regard to the procurement of said warrant, gave said officer his opinion of his conduct in regard thereto, and an altercation thereupon ensued, when said officer seized your petitioner in a rude manner and demanded that he should at once proceed with him to the Mayor's office, which conduct and actions of said officer this petitioner did resist, but was overpowered and dragged before the mayor, by said officer and his posse, and in so doing he then believed and still believes he was entirely justifiable, as said officer
<lb/><pb/>
<lb/>had no process against him for the seizure of his person, nor for his arrest; his summons had been executed and was functus officio, and he then stood upon an equal footing with any common citizen and had no right to arrest this petitioner, and take him by force before the Mayor for mere words The fine was excessive, and The facts justified no such ajudgement against him, and was founded ^upon the testimony of said officer^ He prays that said fine may be remitted, as excessive, and unjust and as in duty &amp;c</p>
<p>James, C, Brookover</p>
<p>I was present as attorney &amp; defend<hi rend="str">ing</hi>ed said Brookover on the charge above indicated, and agree in the statements made in above petition, I think the fine was excessive and unjust, even according to the testimony of the officer, who was the principal witness for the prosecution,</p>
<p>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> J. Throop</p>
<p>The undersigned agree as to the statements, made in above petition &amp; think the case is one demanding executi<hi rend="str">ng</hi>ve interference</p>
