<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>Allow me to introduce to you M<hi rend="sup">r </hi>Tho<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> Rheaugh, a police-man of this city, who seeks authority, at your hands, to arrest in Illinois, &amp; bring to justice, the Rev<hi rend="sup">d</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Bradshaw, chaplain, &amp; M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Guinip, Col<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, of the 79<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Illinois Regt, who, whilst on their way through our state, amongst many other abominable things, stole the slave of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> J.

Besides doing this, the chaplain, to get a pass from Gen<hi rend="sup">l.</hi> Boyle for the slaves, made oath before a Justice of the peace that the Negros were free -- that he had known them for ten years, &amp; that they came from Illinois to our state with the said<pb/>
<lb/>79<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> </p>
<p>They were indicted in three cases, gave bail &amp; defaulted. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Rheaugh arrested them here; &amp; was instrumental in furnishing the proof.</p>
<p>I was engaged in their procesecution, &amp; know the facts</p>
<p>M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> R is a fine policeman, &amp; brave &amp; high minded gentleman -- </p>
<p>I recommend him to you with great pleasure.</p>
<p>With many wishes for your health, I have the honor to be
<lb/>Very res
<lb/>Yr obt Servant,
