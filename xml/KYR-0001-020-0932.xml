<lb/>To the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Two Judgts have Just been rendered by the Hart Equity &amp; criminal Court, in favor of the Comth, one agst H H Lock, The other agst N Goldsmith for fifty Dollars each, under Indictments charging them respectively with Selling Spiritous liquor to minors, The evidence in each case showed that the offences were committed during last Summer, soon after the law under which the Indictments were found went into operation, and the sales were made to a young man who might reasonably be supposed, to be of age,</p>
<p>The proof in the case while it showed an actual violation of law, did not clearly show an Intentional violation</p>
<p>Under the circumstances I am Satisfied that it would be Just &amp; proper for you to remit Said fines, So far as the Executive has the power to remit</p>
