   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>Governor Bramlette of Ky.</p>
<p>Whereas at the <date when="--03">March Term</date> of the M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Lean Circuit Court a Judgment was rendered in favor of the Commonwealth against J H Moore on an Indictment for obstructing a public Road of said County. Now we the undersigned citizens of the County who are familiar with all the facts in this case beg leave to make the following statement to your Excellency. That the road was not injured in the slightest degree that the deft J H Moore was sick and unable to attend the court or the fact would have been made to appear, that he is delicate health, with a family and without means and that the Judgment of the Court if enforced would deprive his family of a home.</p>
<p>Wherefore we respectfully ask that so much thereof as is proper may be remitted.</p>

<p>I have heard a good=deal of this fine which was inflicted for the obstruction of a public highway The Deft is poor and in bad health &amp; I learn an alteration of the Road was attempted which deluded the Deft. into obstructing it and no that he is too complaining to attend Court hence the fine His neighbors have made their application to Executive Clemency and under the Circumstance I very heartily join them <date when="1864-03-21">March 21<hi rend="sup">st</hi> 1864</date></p>
