  <body>
   <p>To his Excellency Jas F Robinson Governor of the State of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Logan Carter states as security for Alexander Carter that there was rendered in the Fayette Circuit Court at the <date when="1861-06">June Term 1861</date>. Three judgments against said Alexander Carter for $20 -- each case on said judgments this petitioner is security. That he has paid on said cases about $75 -- costs of the suit</p>
<p>That the Commonwealth of Kentucky had said Alexr Carter indicted for misdemeanors, and, that said Alexr Carter has left Kentucky is now in Indianopolis, and in the employ of the United States Government. That said Alexander Carter is very poor and unable to pay said judgments and this petitioner has to pay the same. That it is severe on this petitioner and would be too hard for him to pay.</p>
<p>Wherefore he prays that your Excellency would remit said judgments of $20 -- each, and relieve him of the burthen of said amount.</p>
<p>Logan Carter</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Fayette County who are well acquainted with Logan Carter and know him to be a good and law abiding citizen of Fayette would recommend the above petition to the clemency of your excellency.<pb/></p>
