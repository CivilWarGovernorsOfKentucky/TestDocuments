<lb/>Secretary of State,
<lb/>Frankfort, Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Some years ago I was appointed Commissioner of Deeds for Kentucky; there being little to do in that office. I did not apply for a renewal of appointment at the end of the term; recently I have been applied to, frequently, to take acknowledgements for your state, and the relations of business between this State and Kentucky seem to promise much for the future; I would be glad to receive the appointment again from your Governor.</p>
<p>Enclosed I send $5, the fee I was changed under my former appointment. and if agreeable please send me a new appointment</p>
<p>I am Truly &amp;c,
<lb/>James S. Gibbs.<pb/></p>
<p>Comr Deeds
