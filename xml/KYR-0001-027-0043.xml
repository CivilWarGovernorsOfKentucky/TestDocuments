   <p>Louisville Ky. <date when="1862-09-11">11 Sept 1862</date></p>
<p>I certify on honor that Colin G. Gorden was acting as wagon master for the 28 Regiment of Ky volunteers for me the <date when="1862-01-03">3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day of January 1862</date> until the <date when="1862-04-07">7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of April 1862</date>. That the services of Mr. Gorden were faithfully rendered for the Government He had raised for the Regiment forty eight men paid as recruits by Ric<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Menifee, and upon the Consolidation of the Regiment he was thrown out &amp; his men were placed in other Companies. </p>
<p>Thus -- believing that there was to be a wagon master for the regiment I promised to Mr. Gorden that appointment he and I both believing it had to be filled. Accordingly when the wagons were furnished he was placed in charge of them and the teams. and he had a great trouble and much exposure with the unbroken mules in verry bad weather -- His services were valuable to the Regiment and were faithfully rendered. It was our impression that the salary was forty Dollars per month.</p>
