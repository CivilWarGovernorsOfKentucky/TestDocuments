<lb/>His Excellency.
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramlette.
<lb/>Dear Governor.</p>
<p>I have been well acquainted with Doctor John C. Wilson for a number of years. He is a good citizen and has been a loyal Man during our trouble. I have read his petition for the pardon of his son and for the release of the recognizance in which he and Mr. Fleming was the bail of his son for his appearance in the Fleming Circuit Court. If Young Wilson has or will take the amensty oath I join in the petition for his pardon, but if has not taken the amnesty oath, I do not think he stands in a situation to ask for pardon.</p>
<p>As to the forfeited recognizances, I think it will be a just exercise of the<pb/>
<lb/>of the pardoning power to release Mr. Wilson and Mr. Fleming from the forfeited recognizance. I deem it just and proper under all Circumstances.</p>
<p>Yours Respectfully.
<lb/>Francis T Hord</p>
<p>Since writing the foregoing letter, I have seen Doctor Wilson, and he has Shown to Me a duplicate of the amnesty oath taken by his Son, and I now join in the petition for the pardon of Young Wilson on the two charges for which has has been indicted.</p>
<p>Francis T Hord</p>
