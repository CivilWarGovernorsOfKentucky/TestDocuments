<lb/>Dear Sir </p>
<p>Enclosed I send you a petition of John Nelsen and one of his neighbors praying you to remit the fine of $20 or ten days imprisonment, shown by copy of proceeding accompaning the petition I earnestly desire you to remit this fine a great outrage has been inflicted on this old man He was taken and <unclear/> off from home; the officer refused to summon his witnesses by whom he could have shown that he did nothing wrong</p>
<p>Esqr T Conn who was at the trial &amp; signs the petition says Esqr Conner who tried the case did very wrong. Nelsen after the trial made application for a new trial but Conner refused him, telling him to take an appeal to the County Court</p>
<p>Nelson is charged with Southern right proclivities and therefore the unbecoming haste<pb/>
<lb/>and prejudice I have taken pains to inform myself in relation to this trial and am satisfied that Nelsen did nothing more than he should have done. I saw his wife a day or two after the occurance and her face was very much bruised from the blows Gilliland gave her. You will do an act of Justice by remitting the fine &amp; imprisonment.</p>
<p>Your Friend
