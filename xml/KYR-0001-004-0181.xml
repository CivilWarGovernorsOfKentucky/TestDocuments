<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Gov: Bramlett
<lb/>Honr<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Sir:</p>
<p>You will find accompanied with this a petition to Your Honor for the remission of a fine imposed on me by a Court and Jurey in Louisville. The circumstance of the case are set forth in the pettition. I could get other good &amp; loyal men to sign the petition but I deem it unnecessary. I am now living in La Grange Ky. If you desire others, I can get the leading Union men of the town to sign it. </p>
<p>I hope this will meet with your approval for I am poorly able with my large family to support, to pay so large a fine, having been broken up by losses sustained by aggressions committed by the rebels</p>
<p>A. Williams</p>
<p>P. S. I know Mr Williams well, and know him to be a peaceble &amp; loyal citizen who was runaway from his home in Garrard County only for his loyalty &amp; desire to submit to the laws of his country.</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>W. C. Mahan, Clk of the Oldham Cir. Ct.</p>
