   <p>The commonwealth
<lb/>v. } Indictment Kenton -- 
<lb/>Michael More</p>
<p>To the govenor of Kentucky Your Petitioner Michael More states that a Judgt. was rendered agt. him at the present march term of the Kenton circuit court- for $100<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> on an indictment (for suffering a nusance, in a house owned by him in Covington.)</p>
<p>He states that it was in proof of substance, that he had owned the house about one year before <date when="1865-03">march 1865</date> -- the time of the trial of the indictment -- &amp; that he had notice some 7 or 8 months before the trial in <date when="1865-03">March</date>, that some of the occupants -- his tenants, were Lewed women &amp; some of the men thieves -- there was no proof that he knew the character of any of the women or men were <hi rend="str">of</hi> bad <hi rend="str">character</hi> when he rented the house -- He had them removed from the premises in <date when="1865-01">Jay. 1865.</date></p>
<p>It was also stated that on one or two occasions there was some fighting in front of the house -- <pb/></p>
<p>It was also in proof that the men who were living in the house were soldiers &amp; the women thier wives -- </p>
<p>Now your petitioner states, that he did not know the character of these soldiers or their wives -- when the house was rented -- &amp; that after he was informed of their character -- only about three months, before he was indicted -- he could not remove them -- He was informed that he could have <hi rend="str">to</hi> no process agt. Soldier wives to turn them out -- and that he did cause them to remove as soon as he could do so -- </p>
<p>He asks for a remission of the fine -- </p>
<p>Michael Moore</p>
<p>I heard the testimony in the above case -- it <hi rend="str">is</hi>was substantially as stated above -- I do not believe that More could have removed the persons from the house, sooner, than was done after he was informed of their character -- I know More well &amp; do not think he<pb/>
<lb/>would, Suffer such persons to live in his houses if he could have prevented it -- I am satisfied that the fine ought to be remitted -- I was his atto-defending -- </p>
<p>Jas. Pryor</p>
<p>We heard the testimony -- The statement of it by More is, in substance correct. we ask that the fine may be remitted -- </p>
<p>I Was one of the Jury &amp; I think the Fine to Heavy For the offence</p>
<p>Thomas Reed.</p>
<p>I heard some of the evidence, but I know Moore, whilst the parties were said to be in his house he frequently expressed to me his anxiety to get them out of his house. I do not believe Moore would willingly keep such persons in his house.</p>

<p>I agree with the above</p>
<p>N. A. Preston Mayor, C. C.<pb/></p>
<p>I know M Moore and from all I can learn he done all he could to eject the tenants from his House And I am confident he would not rent to such characters knowingtly</p>
<p>A L Greer</p>
<p>I know that Mr Moore has been verry much anoyed by these parties and I further believe that under the Law it is not in the power of M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Moore to dispossess the wife of a soldier</p>
