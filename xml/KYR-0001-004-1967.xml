<lb/>Col W T Scott,
<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir,</p>
<p>I enclose you a letter, I received yesterday, from a young friend of mine, who has <hi rend="underline">pecu</hi>lier claims on me, &amp; if you can do anything for him, I will regard it as a <hi rend="underline">personal favor</hi> -- he is quite a youth, and has been a prisoner <hi rend="underline">over two years</hi> -- I have so few friends, who have any influence, with the powers that be, I at first despaired of accomplishing any thing for him -- It has just occurred to me, that you could help me, &amp; I did not doubt your willingness to do so I am sure Gov Bramlette could, &amp; would, have him released, if <hi rend="underline">you</hi> would call his attention to the case -- I have been told that it is very little trouble -- </p>
<p>Yours very Respectfully
<lb/>Anna Pindell -- </p>
  </body>
