<lb/>Mrs. Ann E. Johnson
<lb/>Dear Madam</p>
<p>Since writing to you in <date when="1862-04">April</date> I have been wandering -- in charge of and looking after our wounded and sick. At the time I wrote you I hoped to visit my family in Quincy Ill. but was disappointed. I have at length settled down at this place for a time, and my wife has forwarded your letter of <date when="1862-04-25">25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> April</date> and also that of the <date when="1862-04-14">14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst -- </date></p>
<p>Amid all my grief at the horrors of this dreadful war and the intense sufferings of soldiers and families, my<pb/>
<lb/>my heart is made glad to find that you are a <hi rend="underline">praying</hi> <hi rend="underline">christian</hi> For nothing can sustain you in the deep affliction through which you are called to pass but the grace of God. It would afford me great pleasure to see you, for there are many little incidents that can be mentioned in conversation that are not of much interest expressed on paper. As I stated -- Mr Johnson fell on Sabbath -- I think about <hi rend="underline">noon</hi>, he was not found &amp; brought in till T<hi rend="underline">uesda</hi>y <hi rend="underline">a.m.</hi> following; of course he had suffered greatly, and was much exhausted, his wound was mortal- being through the body I put clean clothes on him gave him some nourishment and he seemed to revive.<pb/></p>
<p>I soon discovered that it was impossible for him to live, and asked him what he thought of the chances for his recovery. He replied promptly "I can not live," "my wound is mortal"! He then asked me if I thought there was any chance for him, I told him that the physicians thought it impossible for him to recover. When he found that I was a minister he seeme^d^ pleased and though very weak disposed to talk on the subject of religion. He said he had never belonged to any church -- had never made a profession of religion -- but had always had a high respect for the church, and for religion. I <hi rend="underline">found</hi> he would <hi rend="underline">rely too much</hi> upon a moral and correct life which he had been careful to maintain, I discovered.<pb/>
<lb/>I gave him my views in refference to our good works, and the way of Salvation through christ &amp; through him alone. He fully concurred, and seemed much engaged. I had charge of a <hi rend="underline">boat</hi> with some "<hi rend="underline">Five hundred</hi>" wounde^d^ on board -- others were in the same suffering and dying condition I saw him -- however every few minutes -- to give him water or what ever else he <hi rend="underline">wanted</hi> -- He was always glad to see me and received me with a smile -- I went to him about midnight Tuesday night -- he was on the upper deck of the boat -- it was raining very hard -- it was full moon -- though cloudy yet not dark but I could see him and he me distinctly. I sang Kirk White's hymn "The Star of Bethlehem" to the tune of "Bonny Doon"<pb/></p>
<p><note place="header">5</note>
<lb/>The hymn commenced "When marshalled on the nightly plain" &amp; when I came to the verse</p>
<p>"Once on the raging seas I rode; The Storm was loud, the night was dark; The ocean yawned, and rudely blowed <hi rend="str">the</hi> The wind that tossed my foundering bark. Deep horror then my vitals froze; Death-Struck, I ceased the tide to stem; When suddenly a star arrose - It was the Star of Bethlehem!" </p>
<p>As I closed this verse his countenance brightened up and he seemed to forget his sufferings. I saw at once there was a great change with him. I after sang to him the words, "I would not live always," tune of "Home sweet home" -- chorus </p>
<p>"Home! home! Sweet, sweet home -- prepare me dear saviour for glory my home" -- <pb/>
<lb/>He smiled while I sang and repeated the prayer "Prepare me dear saviour for glory my home."</p>
<p>I feel confident that he died a converted man -- I have seen many die but never saw any one die more perfectly resigned -- it was as one falling a sleep. I felt that he was, "falling a sleep in Jesus,"</p>
<p>I think he did not feel that he should die quite so soon He spoke of you and his family said the blow would fall heavily upon you all; praid that the Lord would sustain you and take care of you. His last words to me were "write to my wife," "tell her that" "I am gone to rest" He spoke of the Children most tenderly &amp; affectionately -- <pb/></p>
<p>You ask, "When will this dreadful war end," and these reply correctly I think, "not till we humble ourselves before the Lord". We have been for some time past a nation of practical atheists -- Our rulers have been any thing but <hi rend="underline">God</hi> <hi rend="underline">fearing</hi> <hi rend="underline">men</hi>. The nation had not properly appreciated, the great fact that lies at the foundation of national prosperity and political stability -- "the Divine Blessing." It is impossible to estimate the suffering a^l^ready fallen upon us -- Scarcely a house where there is not any suffering. My only hope is in God -- He can save the nation; I think he will. Until he comes we must trust &amp; pray and hope. Pray the Lord come quickly<pb/></p>
<p>I am sorry so long time has elapsed since you wrote without getting a reply from me -- I hope my explanation will be satisfactory. If I have contributed in any degree to your relief in the midst of your distress, I shall feel glad. I have not written to my own satisfaction. In the midst of the confusion &amp; distress with which I have been surrounded for the last two months, I am in no condition to write to ^the^ comfort of the distressed. I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you before long, and talk with you freely of the last moments of, "your dead," and other matters connect with his decease -- May God bless you &amp; yours, and bring you all safe to Heaven.</p>
<p>Yours
<lb/>J. F. Jaquess</p>
