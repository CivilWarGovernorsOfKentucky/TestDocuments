   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky,</p>
<p>Your Petitioners would most respectfully represent that at the <date when="1859-08">August Term 1859</date> of the Montgomery Circuit Court on the Indictment was found against Mr James Bullock formerly of Montgomery County for Hog Stealing and that before said Indictment was found said Bullock had been arrested on said charge and tried before an examining Court which Court adjudged and determined that said Bullock should be held to bail in $1000. for his appearance at the next Term of the Montgomery Circuit Court after said trial by the examining Court to answer said Charge that he gave bail, With <gap/> his sureties. that said Bullock very soon after his trial before the examining Court left the State of Ky &amp; failed to appear in discharge of his recognizance -- that he removed to Missouri where he &amp; his wife have both died leaving a large family of helpless orphan Children, that he had estate sufficient however to pay the amount of the recognizance -- But a judgment has been rendered against his surities for the amount of the recognizance</p>
<p>They would state that they verily believe said Bullock was at the time of the Commission of the Crimes for which he was <hi rend="str">indicted</hi> Indicted was a Monomaniac, that he had lived in <hi rend="str">many</hi> the County of Montgomery in the same neighborhoold for many years &amp; had until some ^short^ time before the commission of said offence maintained a good Character was very industrious<pb/>
<lb/>and had really been a thrifty man -- but for some time before this charge was made Bullock's health had failed him &amp; his intimate friends had discovered a mental alienation in him. Wherefore they pray your Excellency to interpose and to remit so much of the forfeiture as by the constitution &amp; laws you have the power to do &amp; we will pray &amp;C,</p>
