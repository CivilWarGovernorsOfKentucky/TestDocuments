   <p>To his Excellency Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bramlette</p>
<p>A fine was imposed at <date when="1863-10">October term 1863</date>, by the Mason Circuit Court on Washburn P. Clayton for $300, charged with a breach of his bond as a tavern keeper, which consisted in his permitting unlawful gaming in his tavern.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Clayton is an old man, in very limitted circumstances, with a wife and large family of children to support. He is unable to maintain his family by manual labor.</p>
<p>We are no apologists of the offence for which Mr. Clayton was fined, and would not trouble your Excellency about the matter if M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Clayton was able to pay the fine without greatly distressing his family.</p>
<p>We hope that your Excellency, in view of Mr Claytons pecuniary condition, &amp; his inability to labor for a Subsistence, will remit this fine, if not the whole of it, as much as you consistently can. <date when="1864-04-05">April 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1864</date></p>
