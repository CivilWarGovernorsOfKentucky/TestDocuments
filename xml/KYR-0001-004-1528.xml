   <p>To Thomas. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your excellency will no doubt recollect with painful regrets the calamitous death of the late Genl W R Nelson, he was at the time the pride and hope of our State, his sensitive nature keenly alive to the responsibilities of his position was often excited and when irritated he was sometimes harsh to his inferiors in rank, yet all his acquaintances agree that a more noble and generous heart never pulsated in the breast of man -- He is gone; neither flattery or detraction can harm him more, and whilst we admire the virtues of the dead we should not forget the claims of the living. Genl Jefferson C Davis by whose hand Genl Nelson fell was placed under military arrest for the deed, and after<pb/>
<lb/>some days of confinement he was ordered to Join his command, and that too without trial or even investigation, for it was generally admitted that he could not under the circumstances do less or more than he did. The Grand Jury of Jefferson County however out of abundant caution found a true bill against Genl Davis for <hi rend="str">murder -- </hi>^manslaughter^ His honor the judge of the Jefferson Circuit Court admitted Genl Davis to bail and Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Ware Gibson Esqr and your petitioner are his bondsmen in the sum of $5,000 -- </p>
<p>Genl Davis has been ever since the unfortunate occurence in the Army of the Union and many a battle ^field^ bears witness to his ability and prowess -- The killing was at a hotel<pb/>
<lb/>the Galt House in Louisville and witnessed almost wholly by temporary sojourners so that it would be next to impossible to find the witnesses and insure a fair trial -- </p>
<p>Under all the circumstances your petitioner most respectfully asks your Excellency to interpose the Executive clemency in pardoning said Jefferson, C, Davis for said killing, and thereby releasing said Gibson and himself from all liability on amount of their said surityship -- And as in duty bound &amp;c</p>
<p>Will, P, Thomasson

<p>Jefferson Cir Ct
<lb/>Frankfort. <date when="1865-02-04">Feby 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date></p>
<p>The death of Genl Nelson was a national calamity -- but the gallant &amp; noble services of Genl Davis since the unfortunate occurance <hi rend="str">demand</hi> fully command Executive Clemency as to the public accusation of the Grand Jury A pardon of the offence is ordered</p>
<p>Thos E Bramlette</p>
