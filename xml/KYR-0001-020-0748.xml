<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>B Magoffin. Gov. of Ky
<lb/>Sir-</p>
<p>An application is being made to your Excellency by Mr Ben C Watts of this town for the release of a forfeited bail bond and I desire to assure you that I have known Mr Watts for many years. He is an industrious young mechanic of but little property, with a young and increasing family. The payment of the whole fine would bring great distress if not ruin upon him.</p>
<p>He is an exceedingly worthy citizen of excellent character and I feel confident in assuring you that by becoming bail he did not<pb/>
<lb/>intend to aid the accused in escaping from justice. I have no doubt his generous confidence has been grossly abused and that his folly will never be repeated</p>
<p>By relieving him you will confer a favour upon a good citizen from whom our noble Commonwealth would not willingly take money as a penalty for merely for his misplaced confidence and want of knowledge in the ways of wicked men</p>
<p>I have the honour to be
<lb/>Yr Obt Servt
<lb/>John E Newman<pb/></p>
<p>Newman for Watts-</p>
