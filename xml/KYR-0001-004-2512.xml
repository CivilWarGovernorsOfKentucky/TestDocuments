<p>I Know the within named jurymen and say unhesitatingly they are good law abiding citizens and respectfully urge their request</p>
<p>R, K, Williams</p>
<p>I heard the trial in this case and am fully satisfied the Gov ought to interpose as the evidence showed that the parites all regarded the game played as a joke and the money put up was surrendered to each player who had lost on the game I had no intrest in the trial.
