   <p>His Excellency Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. E Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I called at your office to-day &amp; left for your consideration, the Petition of Capt. Edwin Terrell of the Independent Ky Scouts.</p>
<p>I hope you will grant the prayer of his petition. He is one of the bravest men I ever saw, &amp; has done more to rid Kentucky of Guerrillas than any man I have heard of. The fact is, his little band have been more effective in this service, than some Brigades of Cavalry. His head quarters were in Shelbyville &amp; they gave our town &amp; county protection which we could not have obtained from any other source.</p>
<p>The Hercules Walker spoken of in his petition, is the man who killed the Hills a few years ago in Jefferson County -- The same Hills who figured with the Evans in Garrard County. Walker has been charged with about a half a dozen murders in his day.</p>
<p>I learn that Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Palmer<pb/>
<lb/>excused Terrell for killing Walker.</p>
<p>I have no personal knowledge of the facts about the killing of Ennis Wooten -- but have heard it from one of Terrells band, stated even more favorably to Terrell, than he states it in his petition.</p>
<p>I learn from undoubted authority, that Wooten was a noisy rebel from the commencement of the troubles.</p>
<p>Whether Terrell was justifiable, by strict law or not, in killing those two men, I do not pretend to assert. But I do say, that he has rendered such services to the state as to entitle him to some reward, and none would be more suitable to him than a free pardon for those two acts, and I hope you will grant the pardon without delay, as I most certainly would, if I were acting in your place.</p>
<p>This application is made by me without fee or reward, or the hope or promise thereof, made simply because I feel grateful to the man who has done such<pb/>
<lb/>valuable services to the state.</p>
