Mr Gaillaspie was at the time in the Military service of the U. S. A. and was Captain of Co Ky. 55. Reg Ky. Volunteers and was sent to Bracken Co. on the day of the Election in <date when="--08">August last</date> by his superior officer to assist in preserving the peace, and arrested young Clayton in, what he believed, to be the discharge of his duty. We therefore recommend him to Executive clemency, and ask your Excellency to remit so much of said fine as you have power to do-</p>
