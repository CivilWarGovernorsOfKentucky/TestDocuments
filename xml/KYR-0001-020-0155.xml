<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>We understand that the health of young J. R Isaacs who is now confined in the penitentiary is quite feeble, and his family being in a helpless condition we would like to see the young man pardoned of the offence for which he was convicted, and we believe this is the sentiment of the people generally outside of his friends and relatives of those that were engaged in the prosecution. he has now served out about half the time for which he was convicted</p>
<p>Yours most Respectfully
<lb/>J Newcum
<lb/><hi rend="underline">W. H. Randall</hi></p>
<p>His Excl. B. Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of Ky.</p>
<p>So far as I am individually concerned I have no objections to the pardon of J R Isaacs</p>
<p>Granville Pearl</p>
<p>The Facts setforth in the above Letter I think are True I would like to see Isaacs pardoned</p>
