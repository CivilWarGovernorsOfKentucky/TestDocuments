   <p>Dear Lovell,</p>
<p>This will be handed to you by Sally White a Sister of Nez Alexander a free boy who was convicted at the <date when="--11">Nov. term</date> of the Meade Circuit Court, on an indictment for Burglery. She desires his pardon</p>
<p>Certainly the evidence in the Case (of which She has a transcript) does not show he was guilty in fact but only in intention. The family have a good Character here, and Perhaps Clemency would be beneficial in this case.</p>
<p>Sally wishes your kind Offices with the Governor, and I hope you will devote a few minutes to her interests.</p>
<p>Things rather dull here but I am kept busy.</p>
<p>All well here,
<lb/>Yours as ever. R. N. R
<lb/><date when="1861-02-05">Feb. 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1861</date>.</p>
