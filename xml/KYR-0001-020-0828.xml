   <p>To the Governor. of Kentucky</p>
<p>I Ben Sparks would respectfully state to your Excellency that at the <date when="1860-09">September</date> Term of the City Court of Louisvlle I was fined $500 on a charge of assault &amp; battery committed on one <gap/> Taughen. The facts are as follow<hi rend="str">s</hi> the prosecuting witness and myself had a conversation respecting the separation of my wife from me. I blamed him for the separation. He became very abusive, called me vulgar names, son of a bitch &amp;c I became excited and struck him with a cane that I had in my hand, several blows but did him no serious injury. This is a full statement of all that took place. This took place in the spring of <date when="1860">1860.</date> I would further state that I ^am^ a boatman, that I was employed on the River at the time of the trial, and was not present at the trial and was not represented by an attorney.</p>
<p>I returned to Louisville a few days ago and was arrested under a capias pro fine and put into the work house. I am not able to pay the fine. I have an aged mother who depends on me in a great measure for support</p>
<p>I pray your Excellency to remit the fine and I will ever pray &amp;c</p>
<p>Ben Sparks</p>
