   <p>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin Esq
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>We your humble petitioners would respectfully represent that we have each of us been respectively fined the amount annexed to our names by one Johnson Adams a Justice of the peace of Magoffin county, -- The circumstances are about these, Mr Adams the Justice made it his business for some time to attend every public gathering in his district, and watch the conduct of the crowd, and if any one should happen to swear in conversation, with his friend or friends Adams forthwith made a note of it, and issued an Execution and placed it in the hands of an officer for collection, so we never knew for what we were fined, we never knew that there was a fine against us, until the officer holding the Execution demanded its satisfaction We therefore pray your Excellency to remit the amounts annexed to Each of our names,</p>

<p>We have not procured any persons names only our own to this petition to your Excellency, thinking it unnecessary, as Mr Joseph Gardner, will represent the case to you, and if our cases deserve Executive clemency we think you will award it, It is not the amount of the fines that we care for so much, but we do not want to by tyranized over by a worthless man,</p>
<p>your friends truly
<lb/>John Salyer,
<lb/>and others</p>
