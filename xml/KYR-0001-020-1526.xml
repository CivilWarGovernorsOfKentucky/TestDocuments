<lb/>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In the case of the Comwlth vs Thomas Snyder in the Jefferson Circuit Court his recognizance was forfeited at the Octo Term. Jno J Mason a non resident and evidently a well meaning man deposited with R F Baird the amount of the bail, and Baird went upon the bond. Mason when Snyder did not appear, at considerable expense by a requisition from you had him brought here a day or so after the forfeiture. Snyder is now in jail and Baird refuses to give up the money because a Scire facias has been issued against. As the ends of justice will be attained in his production of the prisoner, Mason petitions your Excellency for a remission of the forfeiture</p>
<p>Resply

<lb/>Deputy Clerk</p>
<p>PS. Mason states that he is not sure that a requisition was obtained. Judge Saffin of Cin arranged it for him<pb/></p>
