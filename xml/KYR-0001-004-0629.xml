   <p>Hartford, Ky., <date when="1864-03-08">March 8th, 1864</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency,
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>At the <date when="1859-10">October Term, 1859</date>, of the Ohio Circuit Court a judgment was rendered against David Sandifur, a citizen of this county, for Sixty dollars on an indictment for keeping a tippling house I was attorney for the Commonwealth at the time, and as Sandifur confessed judgement, I had the order made that no execution Should issue for one year thereafter</p>
<p>Some months after execution could issue on the judgment, I joined the Union army as you are aware, resigned my portion as attorney for the Commonwealth, and paid no more attention to Sandifur's case among many others A few days since a capias was issued, and as Sandifur is without money he is in a good deal of trouble The Commonwealth and myself <hi rend="str">alone</hi> are the principal parties in interest So far as I am concerned I have told the Sheriff I do not want Sandifur arrested</p>
<p>He is a good hearted clever man, has a large family, failed in business two or three years since and is nearly overwhelmed with debts, and informs me that he is not able to pay this fine I therefore respectfully recommend that your Excellency remit so much of the fine as you have power to do; believing the legal costs in the case will be punishment enough</p>
<p>Very respectfully,
<lb/>C. Maxwell</p>
<p>We approve the above.</p>
