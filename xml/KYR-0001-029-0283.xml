   <p>His Excellency Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Robinson.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Wesley Mullins States that at the <date when="1861-03">March Term 1861</date> of the Laurel Circuit Court He was fined Fifty dollars upon an Indictment for carrying concealed weapons, He afterwards, obtained a respite upon said Judgment, until the <date when="1863-02-20">20 day of Feby 1863</date> which time has expired and execution is now in the hands of the sheriff of Laurel County who is endeavoring to collect the fine -- Your Petitioner in addition to the facts stated in the petition upon which said respite was granted, States that he is in a worse condition now, and less able to pay the fine, than he was when the respite was granted -- He says that the rebel army under Kirby Smith passed through his immediate neighborhood last fall on their retreat from Kentucky, and took pretty much all the crop and support made by petitioner last season, and it is absolutely impoosible to pay said fine without seriously applying the petitioner and his family and Securities -- The costs above are more than can be paid without serious inconvenience and hardship He therefore prays a remission of the fine</p>
<p>Wesley Mullins</p>
<p>Sworn to before me by Wesley Mullins this <date when="1863-03-09">9" day of March 1863</date>.</p>

<p>We the undersigned citizens of Laurel County and neighbors of Wesley Mullins, believe the foregoing statements are true and that the fine ought to be remitted</p>
