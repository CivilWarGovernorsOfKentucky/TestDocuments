   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette, Governor of the State of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>The undersigned, residents in Louisville, in aid of the petition of Charles H. Meyer, dated "Louisville Jail <date when="1864-12-15">December 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1864,"</date> for release from the State Penitentiary, where he is now confined under sentence from the Jefferson Circuit Court, which was pronounced after trial upon an indictment against him for obtaining under false pretences, about forty six dollars from Mr J. B. Walker</p>
<p>Respectfully represent:</p>
<p>That they have perused the aforesaid petition of the said Meyer, and believe that it embodies the facts in the case, and that if pardoned, he will keep the promises set forth in his petition.</p>
<p>That the said Meyer was arrested on the <date when="1865-06-17">17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of June last</date> and had been kept in close confinement in the Jefferson county jail from that date until his transfer to the State Penitentiary.</p>
<p>That we are assured by W. K. Thomas Esq. Jailer of Jefferson county, that during Myers's confinement in said jail his deportment was, every way, unexceptionable, and that he appeared to be extremely penitent.</p>
<p>That we are authorized by Mr Thomas to express, as his opinion, that from the delicate frame of Meyer, and his previous active habits, a confinement during the whole of the term for which he was sentenced will be seriously injurious to his health and<pb/>
<lb/>may endanger his life.</p>
<p>That the said Meyer possesses many good traits of character, which, if sustained by his resolutions to faithfully observe the laws hereafter, would make him a good citizen.</p>
<p>That Meyer's confinement, in jail and penitentiary from the <date when="1864-06-17">17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of June last</date> until the present time, will have as decided a moral effect as his retention in the Penitentiary to the end of the term prescribed in his sentences.</p>
<p>From these considerations, your petitioners would respectfully request your Excellency to remit the unexpired portion of said Meyer's term, and by pardoning and restoring the said Meyers to his family and friends, enable him to carry out his resolutions to become an useful member of the community</p>
<p>And in duty bound will ever pray</p>
<p>Dated at Louisville this <date when="1865-02-08">eighth day of February A. D. One thousand eight hundred and sixty five.</date></p>

<p>To His Excellency the Governor.<pb/></p>
<p>The subscribing petitioner J. B. Walker was the person from whom the money was obtained and Smith the member of firm in whose name it was obtained. The undersigned acted as Atty. for the Commonwealth pro tem during the term in which Meyer was convicted and now joins in this petition, because Meyers previous station in life and his education would make him a useful member of society if he resolve to be one. The clemency of your Excellency may fortify him in such resalution</p>
