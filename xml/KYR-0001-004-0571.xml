   <p>Frankfort <date when="1864-03-15">Mar 15/64</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Governor Bramlette</p>
<p>The undersigned states that in the year <date when="1857">1857</date>, by the Owsley Circuit Court, one Jos Redwine was fined ten dollars for an offense not now remembered, for the payment of which I became security. Said fine has never been paid, and since the rebellion broke out, said Redwine has been in the Southern Confederacy giving aid to the enemy, and unless remitted the whole burden will fall upon me. John Dishman <hi rend="str">is</hi> was the prosecuting Attorney and he also is in the rebel army on service. This application is respectfully made for a remission of so much as is within the power of your excellency. I am and have been loyal to the government and state. I served eighteen months in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Infantry and the execution has been issued since my return from the army.</p>
<p>Abraham Gum</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Owsley, in Frankfort on business, are well<pb/>
<lb/>acquainted with Abraham Gum_ Know him to be a good citizen, that he has faithfully served as a solider, and join in his petition, which we know to be true.</p>
