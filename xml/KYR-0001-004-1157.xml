<lb/>Jefferson County Sct</p>
<p>Be it remembered that on the <date when="1864-08-25">25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of August 1864</date> came personally before me John Shuman and being first duly sworn, States that he was indicted by a Grand Jury empanneled in the County and Circuit of Meade, cases No 1 &amp; 2 in Case N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1. was for Keeping Tipling house, and that the same were under the following circumstances. Affiant obtained a License from the Collector of the district in which he resides a Retail dealer' Liquor License &amp; under the impression that the License so obtained was all that was required or necessary he in connection with his other Merchandize did sell Liquors being at the same time ignorant of the fact that he was violating any State Law.</p>
<p>Indictment No. 2. -- </p>
<p>In this case the affiant States that the gaming set out in the Indictment was a mere game of checkers which was very Common in the vicinity -- and one party proposed<pb/>
<lb/>to play the game for a 5 cent piece of Tobacco which was done. I did not consider that gaming and it was the first of the kind ever permitted and that would not have been done only from the fact that I did not think that I was violating any Law. I am now &amp; always have been a peacable Citizen &amp; a Law abiding man. never violated any law of the State Knowingly. and never expect to.</p>
<p>In case of N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1. the Fine is $60
<lb/>" " N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 2 " " " 100</p>
<p>of which fines the affiant has fully satisfied the Commonwealths Attorney the portion due him and makes this affidavit and application for the consideration of his Excellency Governor Bramlett. hoping that the Same will be favorably considered. I herewith sign my name &amp; testify to all the statements herein contained</p>
<p>John Shuman</p>
<p>Subscribed and sworn to before me by John Shuman, this <date when="1864-08-25">25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of August 1864.</date></p>

<p>We being Citizens of Meade County and well acquainted with the affiant John Shuman would most humbly petition Your Excellency the Governor of the State of Kentucky. to relie<hi rend="str">f</hi>ve and grant any Clemency that you may see cause to shew in this case. Mr Shuman is a man that can be relied upon. and think that he would not violate any of our State Laws Knowingly. the game of Checkers is very common in his neighborhood.</p>
