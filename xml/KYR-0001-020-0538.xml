<p>He states to your Excellency that the fine upon him is heavy and oppressive </p>
<p>He states that he is not guilty of the offence for which he has been fined </p>
<p>He declares most positively that he was not at any time engaged in in retailing or selling ardent spirits and had no hand in the sale, nor was he in any way interested in the sale of ardent spirits as charged in the ^indictment^ against him nor at any other time He states that he is afflicted and disabled from performing hard labor and he has a large family of children to support or care for. &amp; Some of his children are afflicted and almost unable to help themselves He states that he is very poor and wholly unable to pay said fine All he has in the world would not be sufficient to raise the required sum He states that he has one child who is of age and who occupies a house on the same farm with your petitioner and who did retail ardent spirits This child was not under the control of your petitioner nor was the house occupied by this child under his control But so it is your ^petitioner^ was made to answer for the alledged selling and fined therefor, when in truth he had nothing to do with it in any way and it is for this selling and no other that your petitioner was fined 
<lb/>He states that the attorney for the comth (Andy Barnett) was so well satisfied of the injustice of said fine that he forthwith ^gave^ your petitioner<pb/>
<lb/>a full acquittance of his share of the same Wherefore he prays your Excellency to remit said fine and release him from its payment</p>
<p>John D Williams</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Green County would state to your Excellency that we are well acquainted with J D Williams and we believe the statements in the foregoing petition to be true We know that he is wholly unable to pay said fine We would further state that that he is old and infirm and unable to maintain his family and could only satisfy the fine by confinement in the county Jail Wherefore we respectfully solicit your Excellency to release him from its payment</p>
