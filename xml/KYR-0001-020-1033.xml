   <p>To His Excellency Beriah Magoffin, Governor of the state of Kentucky
<lb/>The petition of T J Goodman, a citizen of Fulton County</p>
<p>Humbly sheweth:</p>
<p>That during the summer of <date when="1860">1860</date>, upon the opening of the Nashville and North Western Rail Road, upon the solicitation of ^a^ number of the citizens of Hickman, he rented a large two story house near the Depot of the said rail road, in the City of Hickman, and thereupon made an application to the Council of the said city, for a License to Keep a Hotel. Apprehensive, that the said business might not succeed, he took out said license for the period of six months only -- After sometime, he found that it was necessary to obtain a license also from the County Court; and under the supposition, that he could get it also for six months, he accordingly handed to the Clerk of the Fulton County Court, the sum of six Dollars, which would have been about the amount necessary for that purpose. Giving no more attention to the matter for sometime, he was not apprised of the fact, that his application had been refused by the County Court, for the ascertained reason, that it had no power to grant such license for any less period, than twelve months. Meanwhile, finding that the said Hotel was losing business to him, he immediately closed the same and forbore carrying on the same. In this condition, the matter remaining, the Grand Jury of the Fulton Equity &amp; Criminal Court at <date when="1860-11">November Term 1860,</date> indicted him for selling intoxicating liquors by less measure than one quart, without a License, being previously obtained therefor, and at <date when="1861-05">May Term 1861.</date> he was duly convicted and under the laws of the state, sentenced to pay a fine of Sixty dollars. which judgment still remains in full force against him.<pb/></p>
<p>Your petitioner respectfully representing, that he is a poor man; and that if this judgment is enforced against him, will greatly distress himself and family, humbly begs Your Excellency -- as he was guilty of a violation of the law under a misapprehension of his position and not from any design to offend -- to remit the payment of the said judgment of $60.00 -- upon his paying the necessary fees and costs incurred upon. the same. And as in duty bound, he will ever pray &amp;c.</p>
<p>Thomas J Goodman</p>
<p>To His Excellency, Beriah Magoffin, Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>
<p>We, the undersigned, citizens of the City of Hickman, Kentucky.</p>
<p>Respectfully represent -- ,</p>
<p>That we are all personally acquainted with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Thomas J Godman, the above petitioner, that his statement as contained and set forth in the foregoing petition is true. We further state that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Godman is an aged man, in very humble circumstances, but a most respectable and law-abiding man, who has never hitherto been guilty of any violation of the law, to our knowledge. We regard his case, as a very hard one; and which very properly calls for the exercise of the Executive Clemency, particularly at a time like the present. We therefore, humbly request your Excellency to grant him a full remission of said fine &amp;c &amp;c And as in duty bound, we will ever pray &amp;c.<pb/></p>

Mr Godman having gone on under the idea that all was right. went on and Kept a tavern, but before the six months had expired, finding that the business was an unprofitable one, therefore abandoned it, For this, he was indicted by the grand Jury at <date when="1860-11">November Term 1860.</date> and at the <date when="1861-05">late <hi rend="str">m</hi>May</date> Term of the Fulton Equity &amp; Criminal Court, was duly convicted. and under the laws of the commonwealth Sentenced to pay a fine of Sixty dollars -- </p>
<p>I beg to state to your Excellency that I regard this as a case of great hardship and one in which the executive clemency ought very properly to be exercised,</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
