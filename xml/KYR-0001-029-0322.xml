   <p>To His Excellency Governor Robison
<lb/><date when="1863-04-01">April 1<hi rend="sup">s</hi> 1863</date></p>
<p>Your Petitioner, Benjamin Huffman, of Fayette County Kentucky, was on Tuesday last fined, in the Lexington City Court, the sum of fifty dollars for the offense of carrying concealed weapons. I made no defense to the charge as it is true that I did carry the weapon; but it was done under the following circumstances which I hope you will think sufficiently extenuating in their character to induce you to excuse me for this time. About two months since I came to Lexington as a witness in a case in Court: I was at a neighbors house before I started and foolishly put his postol in my pocket; after I had been in Lexington a while I got to drinking and when at the House at which I eat dinner, I met with Mr. Diamond the Captain of the Night Watch &amp; he was showing a pistol which he said was a very fine one. I thereupon pulled out the one I had, and which belonged to my neighbor John Winchester, &amp; showed him what a fine one I had. </p>
<p>I do not own a pistol myself &amp; am not in the habit of carrying any weapon. I on said day raised no disturbance with any one &amp; offered to shoot no one. This is the whole case and in view of the fact that I will have to pay about $26 -- costs, I trust that you will think that this will punish me sufficiently and that you will remit the said fine.</p>
<p>B,, F,, Huffman</p>
<p>We recommend that the above named fine inflicted upon Benjamin Huffman be remitted.</p>
