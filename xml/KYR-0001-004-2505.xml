<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Gov. Bramlett
<lb/>Dr. Sir</p>
<p>Robt. Eastham Esq of Boyd County went the security of a man by the name of Robt. Christy for his appearance at the Boyd Circuit Court on a charge of Gr. Larceny for the sum of three hundred Dollars; bond was forfeited &amp; Judgment at this term for the amount in favor of the Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> -- I have been solicited by the best citizens here to ask you to remit the Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> part of it, upon the ground that M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Eastham went the security of M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Christy believing honestly that the takeing of the watch with which Christy was charged with, was all a joke, &amp; not felonious, &amp; did not want to see Christy lay in jail &amp; his family suffer when he honestly believed him to be innocent -- the watch turned out be a different man's from what Christy believed at the time, &amp; Christy failed to make his appearance, getting scared over the seriousness which the matter assumed. M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Eastham is not a man to shield a crime in any form but is one of the most efficient men in bringing it to justice, &amp; under the peculiar circumstances under which he was innocently betrayed into this case, I think it but right for me to make this statement, &amp; ask your clemency for him</p>
