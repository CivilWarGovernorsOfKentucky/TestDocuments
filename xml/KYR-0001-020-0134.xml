<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Govenor Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the instance of many of the neighbors, of the family of one Presley Ashley: who was convicted of Man Slaughter, in the Jefferson Circuit Court: about two Years ago: and at my own instance: I write to ask you for the interposition of executive clemency: towards him, and that your Pardon may be extended to him: The Homicide occured in the lower parts of this County in what is called the Pends -- Settlement: upon Sudden quarrel -- superinduced, by very imprudent conduct of the deceased; towards Ashley. who was laboring under the belief that He had been dishonored in his family by the deceased; and whilst under this feeling; and belief, the deceased unfortunately interfered with Ashley<pb/>
<lb/>at his own house. which terminated so fatally and unfortunately:</p>
<p>Ashley was shown to be honest and brave, and faithful to a point in his engagements: His wife and children, have been and am now in the neighborhood, and their lot greatly commiserated by all. the children are promising in manhood, and I feel that <hi rend="str">in</hi> the exercise of mercy towards him now would be well bestowed upon an unfortunate human being who has suffered much.</p>
<p>I am very respectfully
<lb/>Your obt Servants
<lb/><hi rend="underline">E. S. Craig</hi></p>
