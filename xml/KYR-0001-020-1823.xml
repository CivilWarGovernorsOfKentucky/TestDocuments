   <p>Louisville <date when="1862-04-29">29 April 1862.</date>
<lb/>Hon. Beriah Magoffin, 
<lb/>Governor of Ky. 
<lb/>Dear Sir;</p>
<p>Inclosed you will find a petition of A. P. Gorsuch for a remission of a forfeiture, dated <date when="1861-10-24">24 Oct. 1861</date>. I will say, this is a meritorious case, and one that demands Executive interposition by all means. this old man has nothing but some household comforts with a helpless to support. Besides his son would never have gone away, if a system of arrest had not been inaugurated here, that frightened many away who had done nothing, and would have remained. This has since been seen but too late by there who started it. The guns, I understand, were retained by all the Union men of said company. I suppose some of the recruits took away theirs, but not at the instance of Capt J. G. Gorsuch for the <hi rend="underline">company</hi> who not go away as such. I am in hopes you will send <hi rend="underline">to me</hi> the remission of the forfeiture before next monday, so it may be filed to prevent the <hi rend="underline">judgment</hi>. </p>
<p>Your very Respy. 
<lb/>Jeff. Brown </p>
