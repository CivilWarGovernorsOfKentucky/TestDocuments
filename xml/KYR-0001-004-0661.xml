   <p>To His Excellency Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. E Bramlette
<lb/>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. of Ky.</p>
<p>The undersigned W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> M Heaton, states that he was tried before the Police Court of Shelbyville Ky, on the <date when="1864-04-13">13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of April 1864</date>, &amp; a verdict &amp; Judgment rendered against him for $10.00 for a breach of the peace, committed by shooting at one Picket, who was also tried &amp; convicted &amp; fined in a smaller sum by half. That Petitioner was drawn into the difficulty, without fault. He had acted as clerk for the enrolling officer, and Picket, concluded to insult him, &amp; drew his Pistol &amp; threatened to shoot him, if he batted his eye. Petitioner had not spoken to Picket. So soon as he got a chance to do so, he drew his Pistol to defend himself, against Pickets assault, &amp; shot at Picket several times but did not hit him. He was arrested &amp; tried as stated. The witnesses present &amp; Picket were all secessionist &amp; would not state what Pickett had done to provoke the difficulty, but said they could not recollect. The mob of the Jury who tried him were also secessionists. He is conscious that he<pb/>
<lb/>was not to blame in the affair, &amp; therefore prays to have the fine remitted, &amp; as in duty bound he will ever pray &amp;c</p>
<p>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> M Heaton says the statements of the foregoing Petition are true</p>
