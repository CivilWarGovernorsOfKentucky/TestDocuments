<lb/>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bramlette 
<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir </p>
<p>Mr Saml Miles the bearer of this visits you in distress - about 8 or 9 months ago his son W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Miles was arrested under a charge of three robberies in one night &amp; held to bail in 1000$ each case when court sat in Ballard County Bill failed to come up &amp; his bonds with his father the bearer ^security^ was forfeited &amp; since a Jugt went on These. Execution is in the sherrifs hands &amp; levied on the old mans land &amp; tobacco also he has &amp; not enough to pay the Jud<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of $3000 in the aggregate. &amp; is advertized for sale &amp; so the old man &amp; his wife are about to be <hi rend="str">harmless</hi> homeless - the defendant Bill Miles has joined Forests band- The old man as you will see is quite ignorant &amp; I believe when he went security thought his son innocent, however I suppose he did what any parent would do- from the evidence I cannot say any thing in favor of his son I only feel sorry for the father- The old man comes up and wishes to pay my perquisites &amp; get from you all the leniency you can properly show- The old gentleman has always born the name of an honest man an I am Told- I suggest the propriety of letting him off with all that is coming<pb/>
<lb/>to the state but $1000 &amp; give him one year on that, it added to my perquisites will be $1900- I suggest further that if in a year he will produce Bill Miles for Trial to let him off with the $1000</p>
<p>Your ob
<lb/>P D Yeiser</p>
<p>P.S. I wrote you recently in regard to some respites you had given in Ballard &amp; Graves countys for 1 year in which you made no savings for costs &amp; my perquisites, so that now the sheriff will not levy for that much or clerks issue executions, I suppose this was an oversight- further the fines respited were replevied &amp; no provision made to hold the security in replevin bond the respite not understanding-</p>
