<lb/>Hon Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E Bramlette.
<lb/>Frankfort Ky.
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I heard from Lt Dawson yesterday that the Presidnet said he would abolish marshall law on tomorrow, and that he would dispose of the negro troops by mustering them out as rapidly as possible. Genl Grant said he had already given a synopsis of an order to that effect. That he had been through the Country and was satisfied that the necessities of the Country demanded this.</p>
<p>The Palmer &amp; Smith quarrel is still boiling. Rousseau is now here &amp; favor Palmer's retention and says Brisbin is the author of all the trouble and intimates that Palmer has no authority<pb/>
<lb/>to reverse him -- Palmer turns the whole thing on the negro as everything now must necessarily turn. It may now be truly said that thirty millions of freemen, to free the negro, have enslaved themselves.</p>
<p>The rights interests &amp;c of the negro now absorb Everything.</p>
<p>The atty Genl will be in Kenty before you get this <hi rend="str">under</hi> <hi rend="str">you</hi> wherefore this visit, may be answered in the negro question, although I Know nothing cirtainly of the purposes of the visit -- </p>
<p>I hope you will <unclear/> to the attempt made by Palmer to place you in a false position politically before the people. So much of the controversy has been published that there may no longer by any <unclear/> concerning the manuscript sent you.</p>
<p>I am respectfully
<lb/>C D Pennebaker</p>
