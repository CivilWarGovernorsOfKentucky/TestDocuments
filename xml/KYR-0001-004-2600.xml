   <p>New Castle <date when="1865-10-05">Oct 5 65</date>
<lb/>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I send this morning the petition of sundry citizens of the county asking the President of the United States to pardon Col Humphrey Marshall He has taken the amnesty oath and filed his petition for pardon, which he wants strengthened by that of his former neighbors and friends and by your official endorsement</p>
<p>Whilst we deprecate the <hi rend="str">position</hi>course of the petitioner which has ^brought^ this great trouble upon him, we can now only look at him as humble penitant asking mercy and pardon from<pb/>
<lb/><hi rend="str">from</hi> his fellow man. under such circumstances ought we to withold our aid</p>
<p>His family are in absolute want. they have informed me that for weeks at a time they have lived without a morsel of meat. Too proud to ask although they so sorely needed help -- Leaving the man and his misdeeds entirely out of the question, is not the condition of an inocent, unoffending &amp; helpless family a sufficient appeal to our generous nature: to induce us to grant the poor boon of our influence to have restored to them their natural protector &amp; benefactor.</p>
<p>I think I know you sufficiently well, to know that an appeal on behalf of the distressed is never heard in vain by you<pb/></p>
<p>With your official endorsement of the petition. forwarded by you to the proper authorities at Washington I feell confident the pardon would at once be granted.</p>
<p>Hoping that you will give the matter your earliest attention -- </p>
<p>I am Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Your 
<lb/>Obt friend &amp; Svt
<lb/>I N Webb</p>
<p>Please inform me what action you take in the matter -- </p>
<p>I N W</p>
