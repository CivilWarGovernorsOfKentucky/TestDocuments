  <body>
   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>Beriah M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Hopkins County and state of Kentucky have many of us heard a detail of all of the testimony and circumstances connected with the trial of Thos B Wadlington for the Killing of M A Cartwright which occured in the County of Caldwell Sometime past would respectfully State that it is our candid opinion upon a fair and impartial investigation of all the facts connected with the unfortunate affair that said T B Wadlington has been unjustly dealt with -- while we Say this we would not wish to be understood in the slightest degree to cast any censure or reflection upon the court or the officers of the court whose province it was to adjudicate in the case but we feel authorized to Say so from Several circumstances that have presented themselves previous to as well as during the pendency of the Trial. We feel satisfied in our own minds that the difficulty was not Sought for by Wadlington and that the Killing was wholly and entirely in self defence We therefore under these circumstances appeal to your Excellency in good faith and under our honest convictions of right and Justice to extend to him that mercy which his case demands And when you shall weigh the testimony in his case investigate thoroughly all the varied circumstances connected therewith we feel conscious that your high regard for a practical ^conformity^ to the laws and principles of rectitude will not conflict with that high Sense of Justice and propriety which you hold and cherish So dearly and we therefore hope that you (as we do) will come to the conclusion that this unfortunate man may not only be judged in mercy but that he may secure at the hands of your Excellency <hi rend="underline">full</hi> and <hi rend="underline">free</hi> <hi rend="underline">pardon</hi> and we your Petitioners will feel as ever Your friends truly</p>
