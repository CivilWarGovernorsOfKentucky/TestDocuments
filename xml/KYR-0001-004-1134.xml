   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned your petitioner, Green B. Million, represents that at the <hi rend="str">March</hi> <date when="1864-06">June Term 1864</date> of the Madison Circuit Court a Judgment was rendered against him for the sum of $100 besides costs as bail for James J. Kanatzar who had been indicted in said Court for shooting at without wounding and had given the undersigned as bail for his appearance.</p>
<p>Prior to the time of the shooting for which he was indicted said Kanatzar was a quiet peaceable young man and his father had died a short time before. Said Kanatzar did not commence the affray but was unavoidably drawn into it by being in company with a brother-in Law who was the party immediately engaged. As Kanatzar had been a young man of good character and standing your petitioner did not hesitate to become his security. Since that time, at a thoughless moment, Kanatzar was induced to join the Rebel Army -- was captured and at the date of the Judgment was in prison so that his appearance at Court was impossible.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner feels that it would be a hardship for him to pay it as he acted strictly in accordance with what he regarded his duty as a Citizen to a clever young man &amp; neighbor.<pb/>
<lb/>your petitioner has a considerable family and at the present prices of everything his expenses, including his Federal &amp; State Taxes, are very heavy. They are chiefly dependent on his labor for a Support &amp; <hi rend="str">he</hi> ^your petitioner^ is an industrious and hard working man -- the few negroes he had fit for labor having joined the Army -- </p>
<p>He prays your Excellency to remit said Judgment or so much thereof as the law authorizes.</p>
<p>Green B Million</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Madison County concur in the prayer of the Petition.</p>
