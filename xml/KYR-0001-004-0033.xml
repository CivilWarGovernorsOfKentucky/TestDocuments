   <p>To His Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of kentucky:</p>
<p>The undersigned Citizens of Ripley Ohio state: W<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. M. Bartley (called Bartlett), a citizen of this place was recently indicted in the Mason Circuit Court Ky and convicted of larceny and sent to the Penitentiary for one year. They have ascertained it as a fact and so state it that when the offence was committed he was in a state of intoxication. While in the condition, he is different from the generality of persons. he borders upon lunacy, and seems to have no consciousness of what he is doing. This is his first offence. He has a delicate wife and several children who are left in a state of utter destitution. In view of the circumstances the undersigned unite in what they understand was part of the verdict of the Jury and earnestly recommend your Excellency to pardon him
