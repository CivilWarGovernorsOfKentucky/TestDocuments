   <p>Wheras the fine above spoken of is the third fine for the Same offense, we petition that it Shall not be remitted. We are governed by a Town Charter granted by the State Legislature and if we are not Supported in the Enforcement of our Laws we cannot keep an orderly Town. Through the Selling of Whiskey and other intoxicating Liquors we have already had several breaches of the peace on the Sabbath. and by the assemblage of disorderly Negros in front of Sd Soergel Hotel on the Sabath Ladys have been prevented from passing along Main Street to Church. And wheras the Law abiding citizens have been in dread of a Serious riot for months on account of the Selling of whiskey in this Town in violation of our Laws and in consequence of bad feeling engendered by the disorderly action of the negroes, we humbly beg you to give your Earnest attention to this petition.</p>
