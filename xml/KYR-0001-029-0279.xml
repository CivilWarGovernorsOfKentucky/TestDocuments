   <p>To His Excellency James F. Robinson</p>
<p>Governor of Kentucky -- The undersigned would respectfully represent and state, that on the <date when="1860-11-27">2<hi rend="str">6</hi>7 day November 1860</date> -- he became security or bail for J. N -- Camp on a charge of obtaining money under false pretenses -- said bail was $250. The party failed to appear and the bond was forfeited, and Judgment rendered against the undersigned for the amount -- and execution is now in the Sheriffs hands for collection -- The facts connected with going said bail are substantially as follows -- Camp had been in Jail for weeks, had become sick and was growing worse every day, until his further remaining was dangerous to his health &amp; life -- At this time his wife arrived from New Orleans and besought every one she could to go bail for her her husband -- (who was not a resident of the state) and all declined -- She then appealed to me, and I yielded and signed the bond. He was released &amp; left &amp; has so far as I know never been heard of in this ^state^ since -- The atto. for the Comth &amp; other costs must be paid, but for the rest I would respectively ask to be relieved.</p>
