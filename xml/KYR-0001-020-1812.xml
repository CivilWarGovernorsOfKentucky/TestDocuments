   <p>Hon. Beriah Magoffin 
<lb/>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. of Kentucky, </p>
<p>Your Petitioner, A. P. Gorsuch, would respectully petition that during the summer of <date when="1861">1861</date>, his son James G. Gorsuch being a captain of a company of the Kentucky ^State^ Guard, was invited by several of his friends to bring his company out in the neighborhood of Elizabethtown to drill in camp for instruction. He returned to the City, leaving his company with their arms there, when he was arrested for misapproing state arms there, and I was called upon to go, with several others, legal gentlemen, on his recognisance, to appear at the next term of the Jefferson Circuit Court. I was informed by some of the attorneys that he had the right to hold Camp for instruction in the neighborhood, and that he violated no law by so doing. I am satisfied he had not violated ^any law^ in so doing. I knew others as well as himself had done the same thing in this neighborhood before. Upon the time of the holding the <date when="1861-10">Oct. term 1861</date>, of the said Court, the war was raging to such an extent here, the Federal Government recruiting with great vigor in this city, that it became very unsafe for anyone who did not endorse the acts of the Administration to<pb/>
<lb/>remain. Some had been arrested without any cause known to them; and the said Gorsuch became frightened and did not appear, and the recognisance was forfeited. One other ^party^ besides myself was summoned upon the forfeiture and you have remitted same; the others and more <hi rend="underline">responsible</hi> parties have gone away, leaving me as the only remaining one to pay the whole claim of Eight Hundred Dollars, the amount of the forfeiture taken <date when="1861-10-24">24th Oct<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. 1861</date>. Petitioner understands that said J. G. Gorsuch has never taken up arms against the Government, and what has become of the arms he is not informed. They may have been restored to the County Court, as to this he does not know however. Your petitioner would state that he is an old and feeble man of 69 years, with a helpless family to support, and that he is very poor, and totally unable under the pressure of the times to pay this debt if judgement be rendered against him. Indeed if he be compelled to pay it, his family and himself will be left entirely destitute of everything. </p>
<p>He prays that you may take the premises into consideration and grant him a remission of said forfeiture before judgement is taken, and he will ever pray. A P Gorsuch </p>
<p>A. P. Gorsuch says he believes the statments<pb/>
<lb/>contained in the foregoing petition are true.</p>

<p>We the undersigned petitioners join in the prayer of A. P. Gorsuch for Executive Clemency</p>
<p><milestone unit="column" n="2"/><cb n="1"/>Shortly after the Judgement above was rendered the legislature repealed the law making it a Felony to remove &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi> public arms &amp; under all the circumstances I would be glad to see this Judgement remitted</p>

<p>I know nothing of this case; but I have known Mr. Gorsuch, the petitioner for several years, and I think him a clever man, and would be pleased to see him released from this penalty</p>
