   <p>To His Excellency,
<lb/>The Govenor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your petitioners, Frederick Sloan &amp; John Blakely, would respectfully state that upon an indictment against them in the City Court of Louisville for gaming, to which they pleaded guilty, they were, on the <date when="1865-09-13">13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of Sept<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, 1865</date>, fined and adjudged to pay the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the sum of five hundred dollars, and costs.</p>
<p>They state that they have already paid to the trustee of the Jury fund (who is the proper officer, as they are advised<hi rend="str">)</hi>, to receive the same) $150 of said fine, which is the amount to which the attorney for the Commonwealth is Entitled, also the costs upon the proceeding, leaving still a balance against them of $350.<hi rend="sup">00</hi> in favor of the Commonwealth. They, therefore, respectfully petition your Excellency to remit the amount of said fine coming to the Commonwealth, feeling that they have already paid enough to punish them sufficiently for the offense of which they have been adjudged &amp; of which they admit they were guilty.</p>
<p>Added to this they would also state that from various circumstances, they<pb/> 
<lb/>have been reduced in their means, &amp; they do not wish to be compelled to apply to their friends for pecuniary aid to relieve them from arrest to satisfy the claim of the Commonwealth aforesaid against them.</p>
<p>To that end, they renew their prayer for the interposition of your Excellency's clemency in the premises; &amp; they ever will &amp;<hi rend="sup">c</hi>.</p>
<p>The defts have paid to me as trustee of the jury fund one hundred &amp; fifty dollars of the fine also the costs in full in the Case referred to in their petition</p>
