   <p>Louisville Ky. <date when="1864-01-11">Jan. 11<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> 1864</date>
<lb/>To His Excellence. Thos. E. Bramlett
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Commonwealth of Ky.
<lb/>vs. } Police Court of Louisville
<lb/>Catharine Obrien</p>
<p>Catharine was fined on the <date when="1864-01-05">5<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> of Jan 1864</date> the Sum of fifty dollars. She is a Poore Irish woman who makes her living mainly by washing. She has Several Small children dependant upon her for Sustainance, Her Husband is at the present time in the Federal Army</p>
<p>There was only one witness testified against her, and She was and Irish woman, who Seemed to be actuated from feelings of Spite &amp; malice, it was Shown on the trial that Catharine and the Witness had had a dificulty and a fight a few days before which was the cause of the above prosecution. We would here remark that ^the^ fine was for allowing Soldiers to drink whisky in her house &amp;c.<pb/></p>
<p>We ask your Excellency in view of Catharine Obrien's extreme poverty that this fine be remitted. She is wholy unable to pay anthing and unless this fine is remitted She will have to pay it by being confined in the <hi rend="underline">work-house</hi>, and in that event her children would have to suffer and perhaps starve to death. We would close by Saying that we feel confident that She is a Subject worthy of Executive clemency.</p>

<p>I think the charge made against Catharine OBryan, was fully proved. She is a very poor woman, and her husband has for a long time been a soldier in the Federal Army. The association of her husband in the Army, may have, caused the frequent visits of soldiers to the house of his wife. She is rather old &amp; humanity certainly pleads in her bihalf at least for a remission of a portion of the fine assessed against the petitioner</p>
