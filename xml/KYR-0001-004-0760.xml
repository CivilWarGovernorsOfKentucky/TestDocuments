   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Martin B Debaun would respectfully represent That he is now confined in Jail in Frankiln <hi rend="str">Mercer</hi> County on an Indictment found in Mercer <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> Circuit Court by the Grand Jury for malicious shooting at John M Alexander without wounding which is alledged to have occurred in said County of Mercer the <date when="1862-04-01">first day of April 1862</date></p>
<p>That the history of said occurence is as follows That that William Kosler who was a union home guard got into a dispute with <unclear>Werlty</unclear> Ro<unclear/> a returned confiderate soldier in regard to <unclear/> matters and ^it^ progressed to a fight between <unclear/> parties. Jno M Alexander then <unclear/> <unclear/> <unclear/> Korlon off if Robards drew his pistol and shot Korlon in the leg. Debaun being there present snatched up the pistol which fell from the belt of Roberts and fired at Alexander but without the ball taking effect <gap/> Debaun and Korlon were brothers in law and both belonged to Capt H Barnes Mercer Home guard.</p>
<p>Korlon had been shot in the leg before Debaun interfered and he feared and believed that the said Alexander who was a southern rights man would kill said Korlon unless your petitioner interfered and which he did to save the life of his Brother in law and a Brother union soldier and to prevent said Alexander from committing a felony by murdering him Koslon That Alexander was armed with a Revolver and that your petitioner could give no one except by the use of the pistol aforesaid as it would have indangered his own life to have laid hands on said Alexander at the time</p>
<p>Your petitioner states that he has enlisted in the Cavalry some two months ago and before he was put in Jail and is now an <unclear/> soldier in the 4 Ky mounted Wheelers Infantry<pb/>
<lb/>and pray that he may be permitted to return duty as that and that your excellency will grant him a discharge from prison and a pardon for the offence charged agt him as alledged</p>
<p>Sworn to before me by M B Debaun this <date when="1864-04-29">29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> April 1864</date>.</p>
