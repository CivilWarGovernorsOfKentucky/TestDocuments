   <p>Franklin Simpson County Ky
<lb/><date when="1864-12-17">17 Decr 1864.</date>
<lb/>Gov T E Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>George H Milliken ^clerk of the Simpson County Court^ was Indicted in the Simpson Circuit Court ^under^ Article 1 -- Section 17. chapter 47 of the Revised Statutes for issuing license to a couple to marry. which marriage was prohibited by the statute, the woman having a living husband from whom she was not divorced, and the marriage therefore prohibited by the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> subsection of Section 2 of said Article.</p>
<p>While Mr Milliken did not believe I could have sustained the Indictment by proof, that is, that I could ^not^ have proved that he issued the license, knowing it to have been for a marriage prohibited by law. he preferred to make no defense, and Suffered the Judgment to go by default or confession, for a fine of five hundred dollars, which Judgt was rendered by the Court, <hi rend="underline">and</hi> <hi rend="underline">the</hi> <hi rend="underline">Court</hi> <hi rend="underline">postponed</hi> <hi rend="underline">the</hi> <hi rend="underline">rendition</hi> <hi rend="underline">of</hi> <hi rend="underline">a</hi> <hi rend="underline">Judgt</hi> <hi rend="underline">expelling</hi> <hi rend="underline">him</hi> <hi rend="underline">from</hi> <hi rend="underline">office</hi> <hi rend="underline">until</hi> <hi rend="underline">a</hi> <hi rend="underline">future</hi> <hi rend="underline">term</hi>, This course was taken in order to give Mr M an apportunity, to apply to<pb/>
<lb/>the Governor to have the fine remitted to the extend of his Constitutional power and to pardon the offense as to the forfeiture of office, I know that Judge Graham desires the remission of fine, and that the clerk by the clemency of the Executive be released from the forfeiture of office, Such I am satisfied is the desire of the Community. Mr Milliken is no lawyer, and was I have no <hi rend="str">(</hi> doubt (as he states) ignorant of the Statute under which he was Indicted, He will forward a petition, I am satisfied it would be right &amp; Just to grant the prayer of his petition, and hope you will <hi rend="underline">relieve him from the fine and also from the forfeiture of his office, the Judgt for the latter not having been yet rendered,</hi></p>
<p>Respectfully &amp;C
<lb/>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> B James Atty
<lb/>for the Comth,</p>
