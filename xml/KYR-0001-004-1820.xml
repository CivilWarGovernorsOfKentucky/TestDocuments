   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Gov. Bramlette.</p>
<p>T. M. Barnes was indicted in the Grant circuit court for Suffering Gameing on his premises and was tried and convicted at the <date when="1865-05">May Term 1865.</date> and a fine of Two Hundred Dollars assessed against him -- The evidence <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>on the trial showed that Barnes was a blacksmith and that on <date when="1862-12-25">Christmas Day 18<hi rend="str">5</hi>62</date> some fifteen or twenty persons who had assembled at a grocery near by for the purpose of engaging in a shooting match and a rain coming on the party pressed into Barnes' shop and played some games of Cards and Barnes was present but whether he knew that the parties were playing for money was not clearly proved as there were two witnesses examined by The Commonwealth who were present and did not see the money and two witnesses who said there was money exposed on the table -- There was only one other occasion proved of gameing ever having taken place on Barnes premises and that was on the Sunday<pb/>
<lb/>after the said Christmas Day when one of the witnesses Henry Sturgeon who testified against Barnes, played cards for money for which he was indicted in said Court and found guilty on trial -- </p>
<p>Barnes is a poor man makes his living by hard work at his trade and is a man of orderly and law abiding habits generally, and we believe did not intend any willful violation of the <hi rend="str">land</hi> law.</p>
<p>We respectfully ask your Excellency to remit said fine or so much thereof as you may by law -- <date when="1865-05-24">May 24' 1865 -- </date></p>
