   <p>To his Excellency Governor Bramlette
<lb/>Governer of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Henry Monkedick would represent to your Excellency that at the <date when="1863-12">December term of the Kenton Circuit Court 1863</date> he was fined for selling Liquor in less quantities than a Quart in the sum of $60=, he states that he had a Licence to sell by the Quart, he states that the only witness against him was one W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Downton who stated that he was in the habit of going to Defts Grocery to get Groceries and that on two or three occasions the Wife of the Petitioner gave him Liquor which he supposed was charged in his Grocery account. that said accounts were paid at stated times, but as he had no bills he could not say certain but believed he was charged for the same and the Deft having no proof was fined for the same, although he denies that it was ever charged he states that he has paid all the costs in the case, that he is a poor man and has a large family to support, and that if there was any official committed by those acting in his absence it was done without his knowledge, approbation or consent, and he asks your Excellency to remit the fine in said case and as in duty bound will ever pray.</p>

<p>I am not acquainted with the merits of this case; but the utmost reliance may be placed in the statements of Mr. Gray, who prepared the petition. It appears to present strong grounds for Executive clemency.</p>
