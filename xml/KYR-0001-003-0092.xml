   <p>Head-Quarters District of Kentucky,
<lb/>5TH DIVISION, 23D ARMY CORPS,
<lb/>Lexington, <date when="1864-06-16">June 16" 1864</date>.
<lb/>Hon Thomas E Bramlett Gov: of Ky
<lb/>Frankfort Ky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Your letter of the <date when="1864-05-30">30" of May</date> reached these Head Quarters during my absence in the Eastern part of the state and I avail myself of the earliest opportunity since my return to say in reply that the acts of Congress of the <date when="1862-07-17">17" July 1862</date> (11" sec) (Statutes at large 2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> Session of 37<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Con. page 592) and the act of <date when="1864-02">February 1864</date> furnish ample authority for all that is being done in Ky. within my knowledge in relation to the enlistment of slaves in the army.</p>
<p>Not having been furnished with a memorandum<pb/>
<lb/>of the agreement your Excellency seems to have concluded with the President and Secretary of War.</p>
<p>I am unable to determine to what extent if any, it has been violated My orders charge me with the execution of the laws above referred to, and I hope in doing so to have the cordial cooperation of your Excellency.</p>
<p>The draft which has recently taken place, as you must be very well aware, yielded to the national armies less than one third of the Soldiers called for, and so far as I am advised volunteary enlistments have not yet made up the deficiency.</p>
<p>Hoping these statements may prove Satisfctory</p>
<p>I have the honor to be
<lb/>Respectfully
<lb/>Your Obt. Servt.
<lb/>S. G Burbridge
<lb/>Brig Genl Comdg<pb/></p>
