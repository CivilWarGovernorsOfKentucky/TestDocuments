   <p>I was a witness in the case of the Commonwealth of Kentucky against Jack Davis J<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> My proof was that he &amp; a companion took breakfast at My house, and in paying for it the said Davis paid me a dollar bill which at the time I believed to be &amp; was afterwards proven to be counterfeit -- Davis had other money in his possession, whether counterfeit or not I <hi rend="str">do</hi> did not know -- My impression from the appearance of the men was that the companion of Davis whose names was I believe Jones, was the greater rascal of the two &amp; that Davis was his dupe &amp; was placed in possession of the money to throw responsibility &amp; punishment on him</p>
<p>W M Kenney</p>
<p>The only proof in the case of Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">wlth</hi></hi> vs Jack Davis except the above was in regard to his arrest &amp; finding some other counterfeit money in his possession -- He was indicted for passing the $1 counterfeit bill spoken of by Kenney &amp; the proof in regard to his having other bad money was really not legally -- I defended Davis &amp; Jones and was &amp; am still<pb/>
<lb/>still of opinion that Davis was an inexperienced &amp; Jones a practiced rascal &amp; hence the latter made the former carry the money &amp; pass it -- He doublly hoped them to shield himself -- The appearance of the man themselves confirmed this Judgment -- </p>
<p>R L Davis</p>
<p>I heard the testimony on the trial of Jack Davis, and do not now recollect it in detail, but I have a distinct recollection of the impression made on my mind, That he had been made the dupe of a scoundrel with whom he was in company, and that it was his first offence -- </p>
