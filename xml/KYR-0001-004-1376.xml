<lb/>Gov, Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed you will find the petition of A. B. Miller -- Governor if there ever was a case that merited your clemency it is this one this young man Charles Miller was among the very first in our city to volenteer to stand by the <hi rend="underline">union</hi> he together with another brother &amp; Father has faithfully served this country for three years -- His Father is a poor man paralized in both legs so that he cannot walk one step &amp; his wife is feeble &amp; this son is the only help they Have I have talked with several Gentleman who were present at the trial -- they all agree that he ought to be pardoned -- If I did not believe him to be a Gallant &amp; true soldier &amp; not guilty, I would not<pb/>
<lb/>trouble you with this case but what I say I know to be true wherefore in the name of mercy &amp; Justice I ask you to pardon the young man, it will in my Judge meet the heartty approval of all good citizens who know him &amp; his poor parents --, The afflication of his parents &amp; their good character will plead my apology -- for this ergent letter</p>
<p>with profound Respect
<lb/>I am yours
<lb/>truly &amp; sincerely
<lb/>S. S. English</p>
