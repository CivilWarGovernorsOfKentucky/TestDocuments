   <p>His Excellency Govener Bramlett</p>
<p>Your petitioner the undersigned citizens of Boyd County would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1865-04">April Term 1865</date> of the Boyd Circuit Court a judgment was rendered against Col John S Zeigleer for permitting gameing in his premises for Two hundred and forty dollars. that the playing was done in the back room of his store house by his customers for oysters and other edibles and drinks no money was bet upon the Games, and it was in a room with the doors closed the said Zeigler we are satisfied did not know that he was violating the Law when the games wer played as there was no money bet upon them, we think Col Zeigler is worthy of executive clemency he exhausted his means in patriotic efforts to raise men for the sirvice of the United States and has been but a short time since the war commenced engaged in an effort to make a living for himself, we therefore ernestly pray your Excellency to remit the said fine or so much as is lawfull and proper</p>

<p>I truly hope your Excellency will remit the fine against our patriotic old friend Col. Zeigler -- The law of the case was against him, but in intent he was innocent, as I believe -- as he did not believe that suffering a few old friends to play for oysters would make him liable for keeping a gameing house -- then he has lost the accumulations of a life time in raising his regiment for the Union cause; he has commenced anew, &amp; in an humble way, is making a living</p>
