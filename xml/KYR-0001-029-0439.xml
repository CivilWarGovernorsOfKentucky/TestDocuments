<lb/>To His Excellency James F Robinson
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Sarah Mullins would respectfully represent that she is a woman of color, that she is about 70 years of age, that she is poor and infirm that her son Isaiah Mullins he lives with her and upon whom she is in a great measure dependent for support was on the <date when="1863-05-30">30th of May 1863</date> convicted by a jury before a justice of the peace in Nicholas County of a breach of the peace and was fined $20 and 15 days imprisonment, that her said son is now in jail. that she has a small piece of land upon which her son Isaah has commenced raising a crop for her support, that has not and cannot procure the money to pay said $20 without great sacrifice and that she had no one to work said crop for her but her son who will have to stay in jail if said fine is not paid. She says she thinks the punishment was much too severe under all the circumstance considering her own poverty and that of her son. She therefore prays your excellency for a remission of said fine and imprisonment</p>
