<lb/>Gov Bramlette</p>
<p>Dr Sir -- I learn that steps are on foot to request your Excellency to pardon William Whalen convicted of Grand Larceny at our last court -- I deem it my duty to inform your excellency that Whalen is well known in our criminal courts here. I tried the man, only the court before last for a similar offense but he was acquitted by the testimony of a man who I verily believe swore falsely &amp; who was doubtless Whalens confederate -- On the second &amp; last trial wherein Whalen was <hi rend="underline">caught</hi>, this same confederate Louis Keinor &amp; Whalen, being <hi rend="underline">jointly</hi> indicted, they were <hi rend="underline">both</hi> convicted, the one not being able to swear for the other, but Keinor escaped by an arrest of Judgement on account<pb/>
<lb/>of a slip of the (my) pen in the indictment, as to Keinors name &amp; is now awaiting a new trial under another indictment. Whalen was on bail and while on bail &amp; about the close of our court &amp; before his trial was held over by our city Judge to appear in another case, one of flagrant Robbery &amp; answer at our next <date when="--09">sept</date> court, so that when his one year in the state prison shall have expired I hope you will send him to our Jail again to answer his third offense</p>
