<lb/><date when="1863-10-27">October 27. 1863</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Gov. Bramlett
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I live in Allen County Ky where it is sometimes difficult to go before a magistrate to make oath to papers. There are many widows in that region whose husbands have fallen in battle and they want their papers fixed up for drawing from the government the pay that was due their husbands as soldiers. If I were appointed by your Excellency a Notary Public for Allen County Ky I could fix up these claims for the widows and thus save them the trouble &amp; expense they would incur in many instances in going far from home to make out their papers. I hope<pb/>
<lb/>therefore that you will appoint me a Notary Public for Allen County Ky. You will remember me as having made your acquaintance at Columbia Ky in <date when="1862-01">January 1862</date>; but if you want references as to my fitness for the office I refer you to any one you may know in Scottsville or in Allen County Ky.</p>
<p>Believe me most Muby yours
<lb/>Obt Servt.
<lb/>John S. Siddens</p>
<p>P. S.</p>
<p>Direct my commission if your Excellency appoints me, to Scottville, Allen County, Ky.<pb/>
<lb/>Gov. Bramlette.
<lb/>Frankfort Ky</p>
<p>Dr Sir permit me to Say that Mr. John S. Siddens who desires the appointment of Notary Public is a citizen of Allen County and a Loyal and competent Business man. I hope you will see proper to Grant his request</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>your &amp;c
<lb/>Jos. W. Hecter</p>
<p>I concur fully in the above</p>
<p>C. G. Morehouse<pb/>
<lb/>Allen Co
