  <body>
   <p>To His Excellency Thos. E. Bramlette,
<lb/>Governer of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned judge of the Harrison County Court would most respectfully represent that John W. Phillips was indicted at the Nov Term ^<date when="1858">1858</date>^ of the Harrison Circuit Court for the murder of John Whalin. That at the Nov. term of said court for <date when="1863">1863</date>, his bail bond for <hi rend="str">$850</hi>$1000 -- was forfeited, by his failing to appear ^(the sureties on said bonds are perfectly solvent &amp; residents of this county^ -- that he left the state in the fall of <date when="1862">1862</date> with the rebel forces, and that it has been represented that he was dead; but that such is not the fact, he is now in this or adjoining counties, and has been committing various and agravated crimes. The case for which he is indicted is a very agravated one. He is represented as a dangerous man, and one that is greatly feared by the citizens in his part of the county. He has so fer ascaped both the vigilance of the military and civil authorities, and it is hoped and believed that a reward equal to the amt that will be due the State upon his forfeited bond will secure his arrest ^or the $500 -- by law provided.^ Given under my hand this <date when="1864-02-09">9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of Feb 1864</date></p>
