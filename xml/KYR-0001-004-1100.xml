<lb/>Governor of Ky
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>In <date when="1860">1860</date> a man named William J. Hull of Henry County, Ky, was indicted in our Mason Circuit Court for grand larceny, &amp; entered into recognizance for his appearance at the next Court with Reuben Hudson &amp; David C. Hull as his surities, in the sum of $300 -- Hull did not appear, and his recognizance was forfeited; subsequently he was arrested, and at the <date when="1861-04">April Term 1861,</date> tried, convicted<pb/>
<lb/>and sentenced to the penitentiary for five years, where he now is, expiating his offence -- At the <date when="1861-07">July Term 1861,</date> judg<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was rendered on the recognizance bond, against the sureties Reuben Hudson &amp; David C. Hull, and as I ascertain is now in the hands of the sheriff of Henry county, the place of their residence, for the amount of said bond &amp; costs -- Upon this state of case I supply for these parties, for a remittance of the amt of this judgt &amp;c, all the purposes of the law have been subserved by Hull's trial &amp; conviction, and the Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> certainly cannot desire that these innocent sureties should suffer under such circumstances,<pb/>
<lb/>I therefore respectfully ask that this judgt may be remitted My law partner Col. Stanton who was Comth's atty when Hull was tried, &amp; who obtained this judgment on forfeited recognizance, fully concurs with me, in the opinion that this judgt should be remitted,</p>
<p>most resp'y your
<lb/>obt servt</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Tho</hi><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi><hi rend="underline">. J. Throop</hi></p>
<p>I understand all the costs of the judgt &amp;c &amp; attys part of the same have been paid by these sureties</p>
