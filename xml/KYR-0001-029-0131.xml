<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>J. F. Robinson
<lb/>Gov of the State of Ky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Mrs. Brafford the Mother of Lafayette Brafford who is now confined in the Penitentiary of the State calls on us to give a statement of his conduct and character. we will state we have known Mr Brafford from 8 to 10 years he has been in our employ for near that time and was at work with us at the time of the misfortunate transaction for which he was convicted.</p>
<p>We will say for Mr Brafford that during his whole time with us he was a quiet good peaceable hand and a hard working young man and we think if he had not been led astray he would at this ^time^ occupy a respectable position in society.</p>
<p>We hope and ask in behalf of his Wife Children and aged Mother that you could reprieve him and let him return home to his family</p>
<p>Yours
<lb/>Gedge &amp; Bro<pb/></p>
<p>Clerks office Kenton Circuit Court
<lb/>Covington Ky <date when="1862-12-03">Decr. 3. 1862</date></p>
<p>The foregoing signature was this day acknowledged before me by J. C. Gedge one of the firm of Gedge &amp; Brothers, who are all well known to ^me to^ be me to the gentlemen of high standing &amp; worthy of credit</p>
