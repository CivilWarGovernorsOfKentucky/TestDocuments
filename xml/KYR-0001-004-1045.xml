   <p>To His Excellency. The Govenor of Kentucky:
<lb/>Thos E Bramlette:</p>
<p>Your petitioner most trustingly and humbly begs that you will hear her feeling and feeble Petition -- William Henry who is now confined in the Jail and Penitentiary house of this State is her Son: and in the Year <date when="1862-05">1862 at the May term</date> of the Jefferson Circuit. He was indicted with one L Wright and George Thomas, for Larceny: She states that the said William Henry at the time was very young: and before that time, had never been away from home: and that L Wright who was an artful thief: Known to all the police of St Luis &amp; Louisville as such took advantage of the youth and inexperience of her Son: and involved him in the theft: at Lousiville while He received the goods at New Albany and sold a part of the same in that City: but hapily the owners pursued him and obtained all back. She says that said George Thomas has been pardoned by your Excellency upon an Exhibit of the Evidence, as produced by the atto for the Commonwealth; your petitioner says her son is still young: and she submits to your Excellency if his punishment is not sufficient: She has endeavored to raise him up in moral-<unclear>caracter</unclear>, and but for the artfulness of Wright she is certain He would never have engaged in such a thing: She most humbly prays your Excellency to pardon him: and let her take him home: and she promises that He shall never be in a like strait:</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/><hi rend="underline">V Philmot</hi><pb/></p>
<p>To His Excellency Govenor Bramlette:</p>
<p>I thought your Excellency had discharged William Henry: I could not resist the importunities of this old mother for her Son: He was the youngest of the party: and I join his mother in her petition</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>C S Craig</p>
