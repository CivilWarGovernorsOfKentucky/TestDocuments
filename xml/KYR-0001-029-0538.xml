   <p>Princeton Ky <date when="1863">1863</date>
<lb/>To the Honorable J. F. Robinson
<lb/>Govenor of the State of Kentucky
<lb/>Respected &amp; Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully represent that, at the <date when="--12">December</date> Term of the Lyon County Circuit Court the Grand Jury, at the information of D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> J D Yiezer, found a true bill against Uriah Kevil J L Satterfield Lewis Martin Jr and John Gray for taking on the <date when="--02-01">1 day of February</date> a shot gun from the said D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> J D Yiezer <hi rend="underline">without</hi> fellonious intent. These four Young men were duly tried for said offence at the late <date when="--06">June</date> Term of the Lyon County Circuit Court -- two of them proved an alibi a third that he was accidentally at the said Yiezers on his way to preaching at the time said gun was taken and were acquitted of the charge But Uriah Kevil was found guilty and fined $50<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> The circumstance that involved him in the finding was this. Captain Winston a Rebel officer in charge of a small number of men had his camp in the neighourhood of Princeton Ky And on the day specified went to D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> J. D. Yiezers for the <hi rend="str">p</hi>ostensible purpose of getting medicine and while there inquired of the Doctor if he had a shot gun who replied he had. Whereupon Winston demanded the gun and took<pb/>
<lb/>it away with him The said Uriah Kevil was with the Company of Winston at the time the Gun was taken and went away with the Company when it left On the trial Kevils attorneys acted with the impression that he was a voluntary member of the said Capt. Winstons Company and were totally unapprised of the Circumstance under which he was present at the taking of the gun. and simply pleaded in extenuation -- the Young mans Youth And his previous and subsequent good conduct And the unblemished character of his Parents Some days after the trial and finding, Your petitioners were made acquainted with the facts contained in the Affidavit of P Conway which is herein enclosed and marked A -- with the Certificate of the clerk of Caldwell Circuit Court as to his probity &amp;c Your petitioners are firmly of the belief that had the facts of said Conway been before the jury said Kevil would have been acquitted. We are the stern advocates of executing the laws of our commonwealth against all offenders. But in this case we are fully of opinion that the evidence of Conway which was not before the jury would have acquitted him, and as it was not.. The protection of the innocent, and the ends of justice, fully authorise us in this appeal to your prerogative in the Earnest hope that the $35<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> going to the Commonwealth may have<pb/>
<lb/>your executive remission for which your petitioners would earnestly pray</p>

<p>I am personal acquainted with Uriah Kevil -- think him a clever young man and if consistent with the Governors clemency would be pleased that his fine be remitted</p>

<p>The Undersigned Jurors, whose verdict was given at the <date when="--06">June</date> Term of the Lyon Circuit Court in favour of the Commonwealth vs. Uriah Kevil do not hesitate to sign this petition.

<p>P S. It would be an easy matter to obtain a heavy list of Petitioners. but. I deem it all sufficient to rely upon those whose names appear The other members of the Jury have not been visited or doubtless their names would have been obtained.</p>
