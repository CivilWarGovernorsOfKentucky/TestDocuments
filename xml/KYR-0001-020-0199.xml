<lb/>His Excellency, Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I understand that a petition will be presented to you for the pardon of James R Isaac for aiding in the Killing of John Morris in this County. I known nothing as to the facts in the case, but suppose they will be laid before you. I have been acquainted with the Deceased Morris for thirty years, or more and how that he was a kind and generous man to his friends, but a verry suspicious person, and when the least embittered, he was one of the most insulting persons I ever knew when in liquor he was turbulent and considered dangerous, I understand the fight was entirely accidental, and that one of the James R. Issacs Brothers was engaged &amp; Killed in the fight. could you consistently pardon Mr Isaacs, you would confer a favor on your friends</p>
<p>T. T. Garrard</p>
