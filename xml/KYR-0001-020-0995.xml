   <p>Sameul L. Lewis would respectfully represent to your Excellency that the following facts present a fit case in which to exercise your executive clemency. He states that on Monday last being in the city of Lexington -- it being county court day &amp; he saw a friend very much intoxicated about to engage in a fight with a stranger; that he ran up for the sole purpose of preventing a difficulty and making peace -- that without provacation this man another stranger to him drew a knife upon <hi rend="str">him</hi> and advanced upon him -- that thus attacked he drew an old and broken pistol from his pocket, not for the purpose of firing but of scaring his assailant. for this offence he has been arrested, held to bail and will be soon <hi rend="str">to give him</hi> tried for both a breach of the peace and the carrying of concealed weapons. He states that so far from being in the habit of carrying concealed weapons, this weapon has been broken for many months and ^he^ has was then in the act of carrying it to a gunsmith's to have it mended. He further states that most of the witnesses against him are men of low character, the associates of his assailant. Presenting these facts to your Excellency -- your petitioner would earnestly pray at your Excellency's hands a full<pb/>
<lb/>and complete pardon for these alleged offenses</p>
<p>Saml L Lewis</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Lexington and vicinity do unite in the prayer of the above petition.</p>
