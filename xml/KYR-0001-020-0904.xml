<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>The Govenor of Ky.</p>
<p>Allen S Brownfield was fined, at the present term of the Mason Circuit Court, fifty dollars, for carrying a concealed deadly weapon. His case was called and tried when he happened to be out of the Court House; and in the absence of the Attorney on whom he relied. He and his Attorney had both been in attendance during the day of the trial; and it was by an accident, that both were absent, at the moment, when the case was called. He had no opportunity to defend the case and it is a hard one against him. The accidental absence of himself and Attorney was no ground for a <hi rend="underline">new trial</hi>, and the Court overruled his motion for one -- made on that ground. He had his preparation made for a defence and the verdict against him was rendered without a chance for a defence. Whilst the Court, perhaps, did right to refuse him a new trial, we think his case is one for your excellency's clemency; &amp; we ask that his fine may be remitted to the extent in your power.</p>
