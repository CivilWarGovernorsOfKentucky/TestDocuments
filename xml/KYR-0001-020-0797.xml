<lb/>To his Excellency,
<lb/>B. Magoffin
<lb/>Gov. of Kentucky,</p>
<p>I was born &amp; raised in Warren County &amp; lived there until the last fifteen months. I know intimately all of the family of Rufus Jones, and no more respectable family resides in that county. I knew young Jones, and his reputation was that of an amiable peaceable &amp; worthy young man.</p>
<p>I was employed as atty for Mr Jones, at the time of the unfortunate homicide, and hence I am thoroughly conversant with all the facts in the case. And taking all the circumstances into consideration, I think no more deserving case was ever presented for Executive clemency. Upon a full investigation of the case as submitted to you upon the behalf of Mr Jones, I hope &amp; trust your Honor will arrive at the conclusion that the ends of justice will be fully subserved by a full pardon of this unfortunate young man</p>
<p>Very respectfully
<lb/>C. M. Briggs</p>
  </body>
