<p>R. J. Meyler states he was present at the trial of the above cause -- he did not know all the Jury -- does know that there was two of the Hall family on the Jury -- They are a very numerous family in Bullitt County and have extensive connections in the County -- The Defendants appeared to be wholly ignorant of law -- made no objection to the Jury -- The evidence showed an ordinary falling out between the parties and the striking of Hall by one of the Bishops -- upon provocation of words <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> showed that the difficulty was not looked for or premeditated -- His opinion then and now is, that the fine of $30 each was disproportioned to the offence committed by the most guilty of the three defendants -- W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Fox whose statement he has read presided at the trial as Justice. He has recently and for the first time been elected to that position -- He believes the fine, should be remitted and respectfully petitions therefore</p>
