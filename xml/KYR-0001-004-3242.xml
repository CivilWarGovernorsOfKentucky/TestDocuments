<lb/>Sir.</p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully represent that at the <hi rend="str">Decem</hi> <date when="--11">November Term</date> of the Jefferson Circuit Court 23 indictments were found against George Harrison and 18 indictments were found against T. Featherty and 6 indictments were found against Mike Carrot They are charged with <hi rend="str">dealing cards</hi> dealing at gaming tables. They were simply the Employee <hi rend="str">of Mr. <unclear/> <unclear/></hi>, and as there are Eighty four indictments against him it would seem to be proper to relieve them from this liability. We therefore respectfully request your Excellency to pardon the several offenses.</p>
