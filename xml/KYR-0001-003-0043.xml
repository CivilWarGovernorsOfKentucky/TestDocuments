<lb/>Dear Brother</p>
<p>I received your letter this morning was glad to hear from you you say you are here for the purpose of having me released provided I take the oath and I say that I would see the U.S. sunk into H -- l before I would disgrace myself in that way I am sorry that you have taken so much trouble as to come after me but it cannot be remedied now. Please dont get angry with me. Give William B -- my best respects. I remain your Rebel Brother &amp;c.</p>

<lb/>Dear Brother</p>
<p>I received your very kind letter this morning in which you said you was in Chicago on purpose to have me released provided I take the <hi rend="underline">Oath</hi> which I refuse. I would take a parole for a certain length of time (say 12 mo.) and respect it but I do positively refuse to take the oath of Allegiance to U. S. I am truly Sorry that you and Unkle Tom have taken so much trouble and all of no use, Give my respects to Willie B -- tell him to write to me no more at present -- I remain yours affectionately</p>
