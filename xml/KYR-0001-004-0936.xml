<lb/>To the Secretary of War
<lb/>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Stanton.
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I write these few lines to you, in regard to my husband to my husband Robert Buffum formerly a Lieut in the Ohio Vols, 21 regiments, his health being so poor he has resigned, as got as far as Louisville on his way home, and having the misfortune while there to get into trouble and now can you any way have him released or do anything for him. I will state to you plainly his case, as it has been written to me from Louisville Kentucky. He with several others under the influence of liquor went into a Store and threatened the keeper with violence, and took a pair of boots from the store, and when arrested they found the pair of boots upon his feet he left his own in return, which was proven to the court, were better than the ones he took as they were new ones he did not steal the boots but he was in liquor, which I am sorry to say, and when he drinks anything since he has been confined and suffered so much in prison is the<pb/>
<lb/>truth with which you are well aware of, and it makes him perfectly senseless. He is a good kind husband &amp; father, Oh Sir can you or will you take any interest in the affair he is one of the party of six, that arrived from Richmond a little more than a year ago and was presented by you a Medal of Honor for his sufferings. Oh Sir after what he has suffered &amp; rendered such services to our government, I cannot feel that it is right, that he should be sent away in prison for three long years to come, as he has had his trial and has been sentenced to three years in State Prison Frankfort, Kentucky.</p>
<p>If you can have him pardoned out or do anything for his welfare, please Sir to do so, by so doing you will relieve me of a great burden and make me a happy woman. Please to let me know if you can do anything for him.</p>
<p>Yours respectfully
<lb/>from his wife M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>. Robert Buffum
<lb/>Salem, Mass.
<lb/>62 Buffum St.</p>
