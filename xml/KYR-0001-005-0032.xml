<p>The interference of the Military with elections is ever to be deplored as endangering the security which the free elective franchise alone can give. But the officers who acted under the constraint of Military force should not be held Criminally accountable for an act not voluntary but constrained by duress -- I therefore order a pardon for the offence charged on each of the within named cases -- </p>
