<lb/>Dear Governor</p>
<p>I write to you most earnestly to ask of You the favor to pardon Young W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Rucker of the charge which has been found against him by a grand jury of Clark County for forgery. It is the last case of the kind that ever occurred, upon which to found an indictment</p>
<p>It grieves his father so deeply who by the way his family are entirely respectable The Jury man is in every respect of good character and no conviction could be had against him but now days we can never reach cases on our dockets.</p>
<p>I assure you that the whole County will be pleased if you release him from it and I beg of you to do so. Such favor has been exercised by your predecessors. Crittenden released Morceau from an indictment for Murder. From the County of Lawrence.</p>
<p>Yours truly
<lb/>J W Moore<pb/>
