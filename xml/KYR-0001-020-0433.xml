<lb/>Hon. B. Magoffin
<lb/>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Sir.</p>
<p>At the last Term of the Criminal Court for Jefferson county Charles Hawkins was tried &amp; convicted &amp; Sentenced to two years confinement in the Penatentiary for Malicious stabbing of Thomas Murray. The conviction of Hawkins was on the Testimony of Murray; W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Brown &amp; Jno Koenig. I have learned that Murray &amp; Brown have made an affidavit which with a Petition from the Widowed Mother of Hawkins for his Pardon will be laid before you; I know the man Koenig he has been twice before me on the charge of Pettit Larceny once before he Testified in the case against Hawkins &amp; ever since &amp; on both occasions his guilt was clearly Established his Statement is entitled to no credit that his character been Known to the Jury I am certain they would have given no credit to his statements From facts which have transpired since the Trial of Hawkins I beleive he should be Pardoned he is poor, his mother a widow &amp; without means they were unable to make such a defense as under other circumstances might have been made. I<pb/>
<lb/>Have not seen the affidavit made by Murray &amp; Brown but understand they make statements now varrying Materially the Evidence given by them to the Jury &amp; which if made then would have Insured his acquittal. hoping you may be satisfied that the young ^man^ has been unfairly dealt by on the part of the Witnesses in giveing their testimony &amp; that he is entitled to a discharge</p>
<p>I remain D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Sir
<lb/>Your friend
<lb/>Geo. W. Johnston.</p>
<p>To His Excellency Gov Magoffin</p>
<p>In consideration of the Youth of Hawkins and the anxiety of his friends, and a retraction to some extent of the statements of some of the witnesses in the case I Join in his petition</p>
