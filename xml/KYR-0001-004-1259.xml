<lb/>To
<lb/>His Excellency <gap/> Bramlett Esq<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi>
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky,</p>
<p>we the undersigned citizens of the above named County, would respectfully beg leave to represent to your Excellency, that William H. Johnston a youth who was born and raised in this County and always maintained the character of an honest &amp; industrious boy, but was unfortunately induced by the excitement in the Cuntry, and falling in Company with other youths, who were all full of the Idea of going to War, one of the boys by the name of Gainer wished to get his fathers horse to ride, knowing that his father was opposed to his going into the Service, induced young Johnston to assist him in stealing the horse, but after two days ride, young Gainer changed his mind and went home, ^leaving the horse <hi rend="str">with</hi>^ with the other boys, soon after young Johnston returned home, and was prosecuted by old man Gainer for stealing his horse, of which he was convicted at the <date when="1863-06">June term of the Circuit Court for this County 1863,</date> for four years, we beg leave to say that we do not look upon the act as a malicious theft, could the evidence all have been obtained, we have no hesitancy in saying such would have been the virdect of the Jury,<pb/>
<lb/>therefore we pray your Excellency to release said Johnston from confinement in the Penetentiary and restore him to Citizenship, and as in duty bound we will ever pray &amp;c,</p>
