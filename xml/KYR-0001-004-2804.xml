<lb/>Gov Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort Ky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>There is a Judgment in the Warren Circuit Court in favor of the Commonwealth against W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Cullin on a forfeited recognisance as a witness. Which I am Satisfied aught to be remitted my attention was called to the matter a few days Since. A number of witnesses were recognised in Same Criminal prosecution in the penalty of one hundred dollars each (Cullen being one) and they all failed to attend. Their bonds were for forfeited, and at the next term all except Cullen Satisfactorily excused their absence to the Court and were released, The excuse of Cullen was the Same as the other but being very ignorant of legal matters, did not appear Supposing the excuse of Same would be Sufficient for all, I consequently took Judgment against him by default, Cullen has Since manifested no disinclination to attend as a witness. He is very poor, and has not<pb/>
<lb/>been in actual Contempt of the Authority of the Court, I shall release to Mr Cullen that portion of the Judgment belonging to me, And hope you will think proper to remit the whole Judgment,</p>
<p>Your friend
<lb/>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> B James atty for the Comth</p>
<p>Sent remission to me.<pb/></p>
<p>Warren Cir Ct
<lb/>vs 
<lb/>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Cullen
<lb/>$100,
<lb/>Forfeiture
<lb/>Remitted
