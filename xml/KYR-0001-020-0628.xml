<lb/>Der friend</p>
<p>At the <date when="--02">Februrary term</date> of the Warren Criminal and Equity court a yong gentleman Mr Rufus Jones was tried for killing a Mr Jenkins -- The Jury found him of a less offense than murder and he was sentenced to the the penitentiary for 4 years</p>
<p>Let me say to you that the facts were about these. At the time of the killing which took place at a party, it was in a kind of <unclear/> and quarrel all excited and under the influence of intoxicating liquors and it was done in sudden heat and passion besides as I understand Jenkins had drawn rock on Jones."</p>
<p>Jones is a high toned and honorable young man and an orphan and if at himself would he one of the last men to deliberately do any one any injury, and I further think he has been punished enough and in setting him at liberty if consistant with your duty it would be received as a favor to me</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Your friend &amp;c c</p>
