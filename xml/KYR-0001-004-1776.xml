   <p>Williamstown, Kentucky,
<lb/><date when="1865-05-27">May 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1865</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency,
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramlette, Governor of Ky</p>
<p>The Undersigned, at the request of Mr. George Williams of this County, (Grant) would state that he has lately been fined the sum of $50 for carrying concealed weapons, whether justly or unjustly it is needless to say -- that he is an old man, and served in the war of 1812, and fought in defense of his country bravely -- that he being old and poor is unable to pay said fine without greatly lessening his means of support, having ^no^ one to depend upon but himself to supply his wants. He therefore prays you to remit so much of said fine as ^is^ in with your power to do, and send to my care the evidence of its remission; all of which I heartily concur in.</p>
<p>B. N. Carter J. P. G. C.</p>
