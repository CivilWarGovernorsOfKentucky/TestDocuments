<lb/>Gov Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>A Judgment for a forfeiture of One Thousand and fifty dollars, has been rendered by the Warren Circuit Court at its present term against Levi Moore for engaging in the business of a Broker, and exchange dealer without having obtained license as required by. law,</p>
<p>Mr Moore was a broker while the rebel Army Occupied this Section of Country, and the circumstances attending his case are precisely such as those attending the case of H P Allen about which I addressed you a day or two Since. The court in his opinion and Judgt in the Moore case says it is a case for the interposition of the executive I am of the Same opinion, and believe you should remit the forfeiture, to the extent of your Constitutional power, as an act of Clemency &amp; Justice to Mr Moore,</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>W<hi rend="sup">m </hi>B Jones atty for the Comth<pb/></p>
<p>From ^the proof^ in the Case and my own knowledge of the condition of affairs in Bowlinggreen, during its occupation by the rebel troops I do not hesitate ^to unite^ in asking from the Governor that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moore be released as far as may be in his power</p>
<p>Asher W Graham</p>
<p>This is a less aggravated case than H P Allen, (whose papers are already laid before you) and is entitled as we think to your favorable consideration -- </p>
<p>The brokers and bankers were a useful class whilst the Rebels were in this place -- and under the Circumstances we urgently ask You to release mr Levi Moore as far as You have the power to do so -- </p>
