   <p>We the undersigned would most respectfully State and represent to his Excellency the Governor of the State of Kentucky that some three or four years since we became the Bail of Lewis L. Pulliam for his appearance at the Henderson circuit court. Soon after becoming his bail the said Pulliam disappeared and has not since been heard from -- whither he is dead or alive we do not know.</p>
<p>Soon after the forfeiture of the Bond we petitioned his Excellency the Governor of this State to release us from the penalty of the bond which was for Six Hundred dollars and the Governor stayed all further proceedings against us for twelve months. We have heard nothing of any further proceedings against us.</p>
<p>We now would most respectfully refer the Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nr</hi></hi> to our former petition and request his clemancy and ask a full release. We are both poor and unable to pay the amt. and are kept in constant distress and trouble in <unclear/> of it. Lewis L Pulliam was the son of one of us and the brother in law of the others</p>
