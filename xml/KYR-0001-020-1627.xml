<lb/>Hon B. Magoffin,
<lb/>Sir -- </p>
<p>I write to ask the favor of your Excellency of the remission of a small fine -- and will briefly relate the circumstances. W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Senior, a Lad of about 18 years -- was fined yesterday Three Dollars for fireing a pistol within the city limits -- He is a proteg√© of the city -- was taken at infancy and raised in the Alms House -- Three or four years ago the council thinking him able to support himself bound him out to the matron of the Hospital, who took him more for her attachment to him than for any use she had for him -- And he still stays with her when he is not employed -- He was inside the Hospital Grounds &amp; fired off an old Pistol -- part of these grounds are inside the city limits, and the greater part are outside ^all were outside until the recent action of the Legislature &amp; he scarcely knew it -- ^ -- a neighbor boy saw &amp; informed on him -- The Mayor fined him just the smallest sum, and has Kindly consented to remit the costs -- The Hospital Matron went his security for the debt; rather than see him go to Jail -- until you could be heard from -- She is poor, &amp; Suneior worth nothing at all -- He is a good clever Boy -- not at all bright, and your favor will be well bestowed -- It is a small sum, but a great deal to them -- Hoping to hear from you soon</p>
<p>I am respectfully yrs
<lb/>John P. Phister
