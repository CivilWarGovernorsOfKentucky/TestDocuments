   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette Gov. of Ky.</p>
<p>Your petitioner <hi rend="str">James</hi> <hi rend="str">Schofield</hi> Wm Benson, would respectfully represent, that at the <date when="1864-10">October</date> term of the criminal court for Jefferson county Ky. he was Sentenced to the State Penitentiary for a term of 4 years, he haveing plead guilty to a charge of Stealing Some money from a man by the name of Weaver.</p>
<p>He Says that although he put in a plea of guilty, that he was not guilty, and that he never did take the money. He Says the reasons he put in a plea of guilty <hi rend="str">were</hi> were these: viz: that he had been confined in the Jail of Jefferson county for 4 or 5 months, unable to give bail; and when the trial come on he was unable to get his witnesses there; Some of whom were out of the State; and others at Munfordsville in the employ of the Government as teamsters and laborers; and he was unable to State that he could procure their attendance by the next term of the court; and even if he could have got a continuance he would have Still been compelled to lay in Jail til the next term; and having no hope of procuring his witnesses even then; and having Seen Some cases tried where <hi rend="str">the</hi><pb/>
<lb/>the parties plead guilty and threw themselves upon the mercy of ^the^ Jury get off with only one year, and others, the Same Sort of case, &amp; Sometimes in the Same Indictment, where they plead not guilty, were Sent for 3, 4, and 5 years; I was induced, in the hope of getting ^off^ with one year, and the fear of being Sent the full extent of the law, 5 years, to <hi rend="underline">plead guilty</hi> to <hi rend="underline">the charge</hi>. I was also induced by the dread of lying in Jail, to plead guilty, thinking that I had rather go and Serve one year in the penetentiary, ^than to wait in Jail 4 or 5 months,^ and then probably be in no better condition as to my witnesses than then. So I plead guilty and got 3 years more than I bargained for.</p>
<p>I am a citizen of Hamilton county Ohio; and have a kindhearted and excellent mother who is a widow; and very poor but highly respectable. My character at home is good, as you will See by the accompany letters. I appeal to my God who is my Judge that I am Suffering innocently. In view therefore of all these considerations, I do most earnestly pray that your Excellency will intervene your Executive clemency and release me from this Prison.</p>
<p>Respectfully. Wm Benson</p>
<p>He says that when arrested he gave the name of Wm Schofield, and was convicted under that name; but his name is Benson</p>
<p>Wm Benson<pb/></p>
<p>We the undersigned residents, and citizens of Louisville Ky, believing that there is merit in this case; and that it is one in which the pardoning Power would be properly exercised would recommend the Said <hi rend="str">James</hi> Wm Schofield to the clemency of the Governor; and respectfully pray that he pardon him</p>
