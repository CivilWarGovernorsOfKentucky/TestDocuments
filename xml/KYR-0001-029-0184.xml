<lb/>Geo H Roberts Esq.
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I regret exceedingly that I did not preceed in getting your fine remitted in Case of Comwlth against you as surety in a Bond for David Grant It was overlooked by the authorities at Frankfort -- Yours is a very Meritorious case as I happen to know myself -- </p>
<p>You ask me to get up a Petition -- instead of that I give you this statement as of my own personal knowledge that at the time you signed the Bond you were very drunk. insomuch as to be incapacitated for business -- I did not see you <hi rend="str">the</hi> sign the Bond, but saw you &amp; the officer &amp; your principal going into the Police office for the purpose &amp; you were barely able to toddle. -- You can send the letter to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Bush and he can make what case of it he likes -- I do not suppose I could procure signatures to a Petition, that would give it any weight -- but will make the effort to do so, if you request it -- I trust you may succeed in getting relief</p>
<p>Very Truly yrs
