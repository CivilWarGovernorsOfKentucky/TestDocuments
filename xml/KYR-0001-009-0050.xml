<lb/>Gov. Bramlette,
<lb/>Frankfort, Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I forwarded to your address, a few days ago, copies of our last two annual reports, which I hope you received.</p>
<p>You kindly promised (for which I feel deeply grateful) to cause to be prepared answers to our interrogatones concerning the administration of criminal justice in your State. I should be glad to receive the promised response as soon after the first of<pb/>
<lb/>November as may be convenient. At the same time I w<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. say that, if the work can not be accomplished by the date named, it will do any time within the month, so that we can receive the document by the 1st December. Meanwhile, I w<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. esteem it a favor, if you would drop me a single line, indicating about what time I may look for the detailed communication.</p>
<p>You would confer an additional favor, if you would communicate to me, in a brief paragraph, your impressions<pb/>
<lb/>on the condition &amp; working of your common jails. What is the organization of the system? ^Are the keepers often changed?^ Do the prisoners associate promiscuously in the jails? Is any work required of those who are undergoing penal sentences in them? What are the different classes of penal institutions in Kentucky?</p>
<p>I am anxious to get your views as to the working of your system of leasing the State prison. The principle seems to me, I am free to confess, a very vicious one, &amp; liable to the gravest abuses. What in you judgment has been found to be its practical operation? I feel extremely anxious to get at the truth on this point.</p>
<p>With great respect your ob<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. sev<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
<lb/>E. C. Wines.</p>
