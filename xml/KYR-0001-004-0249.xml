<lb/>Governor Bramlette
<lb/>Dear sir</p>
<p>We were employed by the father of George L Harrison, to defend him, against the charges for which he was recognised to appear at the <date when="1863-04">April term of the Todd Circuit Court 1863</date>. S. P. Harrison brother of George was his bail we have reason to know &amp; verily believe that S. P. Harrison used his best exertions to prevail on George to attend court &amp; stand his trial, but could not &amp; did not succeed, &amp; a forfeiture was the consequence.</p>
<p>We have reliable information, that George L.<pb/>
<lb/>has been killed since said forfeiture.</p>
<p>S. P. Harrison is a quiet obscure, well behaved man &amp; worth about the amount of the Judgements against him, &amp; we think it would be proper to relieve him, of at least one half of the amount.</p>
<p>Indeed we think all the circumstances considered that three hundred dollars is as much as he should pay, his brother was a man of bad reputation, but S. P. done right, to become security for his brother, &amp; we verily believe he done his duty in urging his brother to appear.</p>
<p>We hope your Excellency will deem it consistent with duty, to remit at least one half<pb/>
<lb/>if not more of the Judgements.</p>
<p>Mr. J. D. Christian, sheriff of our county, will hand you this, he can give full information, as to the facts. We have the honor to be your obt servants.</p>
<p>F. M. Bristow
<lb/>H. G. Petree<pb/></p>
<p><hi rend="str">Remit one-half the fines.</hi>
<lb/><hi rend="str">Tho E Bram</hi></p>
<p>Remit all of 1-2-3 &amp; 5 except fees &amp; costs -- which will amount.
