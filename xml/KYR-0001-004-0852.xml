<lb/>Governor Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the <date when="1864-05">last Term, May 1864</date>, of the Clark Circuit Court the undersigned were fined $40- each for retailing spirituous liquors without license. The undersigned keep a large grocery in Winchester &amp; have license to sell liquor as a Grocer or merchant. By neglect their license expired &amp; in the meantime before it was renewed they sold to two persons &amp; were presented &amp; of course fined They renewed their license. They state it as entirely true that they do not keep a drinking house. They keep liquors on hand &amp; good at that, which they sell by the quantity &amp; occassionaly by the quart under their license. They appeal to all who know them for the character of their<pb/>
<lb/>House &amp; their personal character They feel that they have not violated any law in its spirit</p>

<p>I know Hutchraft &amp; Reese well. They are first <hi rend="underline">rate,</hi> <hi rend="underline">high</hi> <hi rend="underline">gentlemen</hi> &amp; <unclear>pruss</unclear> an <hi rend="underline">extensive</hi> grocery establishment in Winchester &amp; do not keep a house to sell liquor by the small The statements of their petition I believe to be true. There is an <unclear>emensural</unclear> desire that they be released from the fine. It is, I, know a case of <hi rend="underline">merit</hi>.</p>
<p>Jn. B. Huston</p>
<p>I know Hutchraft &amp; Rees well. They are gentlemen of fine character, and the business of their house is <unclear>correctly</unclear> stated by Genl Huston. Mr Rees is the active partner, Hutchcraft being an invalid. Rees is remarkable for his good deportment &amp; I feel sure that his failure to renew his license was solely the result of oversight &amp; to time.</p>
