<lb/>Gov Bramlette</p>
<p>There are two Judgts in the Allen Circuit Court against Joseph Howell for $60, each for keeping Tippling house. I learn that he and his friends will present a petition for remission. I hope you will remit them, for these reasons. Howell is I suppose not a good man. He is not now however engaged in violations of law. Has been in the Federal army and made a good soldier. Is very poor, and has to scratch hard to keep his wife &amp; children from Starving. It is utterly impossible to make the fines by levy on property for he has none. He can't replevy, for no one will become his surety. He could be imprisoned on a <unclear>casa</unclear>, but that would not pay any thing and while in prison his wife &amp; children will suffer unless supported by the charity of others,</p>
<p>If you remit I shall give him a clear receipt of the portions due me, and the<pb/>
<lb/>Clerk &amp; Sheriff both told me they would do the Same as to their fees.</p>
<p>Your friend
