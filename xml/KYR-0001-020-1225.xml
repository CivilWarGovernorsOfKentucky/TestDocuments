<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Governer Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I reside near this place. And was Acquainted with Lina Snapp -- died Also with the parties accused of tarring and feathering him, And was called upon at different times to settle the difficulty between Snapp and his wife. I know that Mr Snapp had taken up with another woman in the neighborhood and that he treated his wife badly. There were six or seven that were called upon by his (Snapps) wife to Tar and Feather him, And that the balance were as guilty as the accused Mr<pb/>
<lb/>Troutman</p>
<p>Mr Troutman married and was living in Davis County, and was not able to attend the trial. Or I think he would have been cleared.</p>
<p>He is a poor but sober and industrious Man, Even more so than any of the balance of the crowd that perpetrated the deed If he pays the Fine which is very unjust for him to pay alone. it will break him up. And I think It would be no more than justice to him that the fine should be remitted I am confident that a great number of the most respectable persons in this place encouraged the Offence for which they were tried.</p>
<p>I am Sir, Yours with Great respect.
