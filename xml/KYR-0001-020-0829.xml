<lb/>To His Excellency Govenor Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>The undersigned are members of a Jury which on last Saturday in the Kenton Circuit Court found a verdict against James and Thomas Fitzgerald, fining them $100 each and confining them in the County jail for six months. The Indictment was under the State for Shooting without hurting. We were not as well satisfied with the testimony as would have liked to be, and subsequent developments incline us to doubt seriously, the shooting. We, however, think there was an unjustifiable trespass; but are confident, that $50 against each without the imprisonment would be adequate punishment.</p>
<p>John P Noonan
<lb/>John Hambrick
<lb/>Joseph Lawson
<lb/>John Maxwell</p>
<p>We of the same Jury are not satisfied that any part of the fines should be remitted</p>
