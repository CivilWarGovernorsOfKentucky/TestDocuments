<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In pursuance of what I conceive to be the duty of evry loyal man at a time like this. to <hi rend="str">keep</hi> lay before the proper authorities any information which may be of public interest I respectfully beg to inform you that Isaac Everett, who is recruiting a company in or near this city is &amp; has been a violent secessionist -- that twice he went to the southern part of the state for the purpose of joining <hi rend="str">m</hi>Morgan &amp; <hi rend="str">on</hi> <hi rend="str">his</hi> <hi rend="str">last</hi> was brought back by his relations, At the last attempt he was brought back on Saturday<pb/>
<lb/>night &amp; on Monday morning had a recruiting commission. For the truth of this you can refer to the father of the young man Isaac Everett Sr. I can produce proper evidence if necessary.</p>
<p>I have reason to believe that an application will be made to commission Turner Anderson of Mead C<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Ky in the 17<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky Mr T. A. is &amp; has been a secessionist from the beginning I know it is impossible for the appointing power to know of the standing of evry applicant &amp; conceive it to be the duty of evry loyal man to give proper information in regard to applicants who are unworthy of trust. </p>
<p>I am Dep marshall of the L Chancery Court &amp; am ready to stand to the information<pb/>
<lb/>I give at any time &amp; place required. I refer you to Hon J Speed, N Wolf, B Ballard &amp; the Union men of the city generally</p>
