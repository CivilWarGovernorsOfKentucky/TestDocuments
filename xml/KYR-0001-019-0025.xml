<p>I am deeply impressed with, the Shamefully helpless situation in which, the last legislature has left the State of Kentucky -- with a reputation for shivalry and efficiency in war unsurpassed by by an State She now stands like a fettered giant -- the sport and <unclear/> of all around us -- You have discharged your whole duty I admit; but utter no remedy^s^, -- can the people not do what their faithless representatives have failed to do^s^, -- It has occurred to that efficient men in each County might raise by subscription or other contribution, the necessary funds to buy arms &amp; ammunition -- </p>
<p>We want nothing but arms and ammunition and I will vouch for the balance,</p>
<p>I merely make the suggestion, your better acquaintance with the sentiments and feelings of the people throughout the state will enable you to Judge as to the practicability of the idea -- </p>
<p>I fear verry much that under the Existing state of things we could not procure the arms even if we had the funds -- </p>
<p>If your engagements will allow I should be glad to have your views on the whole subject -- <unclear/> we should be armed whether we stand by the Union or go with the south </p>
<p>Yours &amp;c
