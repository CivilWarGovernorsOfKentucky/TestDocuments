Half the usual price for transmission will be charged for repeating the message; and while this Company will, as heretofore, use every precaustion to ensure correctness, it will not be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission or delivery of repreated messages, beyond an amount exceeding five hundred times the amount paid for sending the message; nor will it be responsible for mistakes or delays in the transmission of unrepeated messages from whatever cause they may arise, nor for delays arising from interruptions in the working of its Telegraphs, nor for any mistake or omission of any other Company, over whose lines a message is to be sent to reach the place of destination. All messages will hereafter be received by this Company for transmission, subject to the above conditions.</p>
