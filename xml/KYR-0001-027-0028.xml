<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>I have the honor to inclose a copy of the advertisement to British subjects which I propose to insert in the Louisville papers.</p>
<p>Upon reflection in the remarks which you made with regard to the character of the evidence of nationality, it <unclear>I trust the</unclear> that it might be possible to suggest a form of certificate which would be more satisfactory than an<pb/>
<lb/>affidavit before a notary Public. On inquiry I found that the machinery of the County Courts &amp; Courts of Record appeared to supply precisely what I required. -- that certificates obtained from these Courts upon proof could be satisfactory evidence &amp; would obviate the necessity of a second examination before the exempting officer. I have therefore suggested applications to these Courts; I hope, Sir,<pb/>
<lb/>that this recommendation will meet with your approval.</p>
<p>With the exception of this point, and the additional paragraph respecting persons who have "declared intention," the notice is identical with the draft which I had the honor of submitting to you.</p>
<p>With renewed thanks for your courtesy and friendly expressions
<lb/>I have the honor to be, Sir,
<lb/>Your most obedient Servant,</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">H. Percy Anderson</hi></p>
