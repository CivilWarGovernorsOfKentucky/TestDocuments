   <p>To His Excellency Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of the Comth. of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner John Bunch would represent that he with Dr. A R Barton &amp; Lee Leforce engaged in a game of cards for amusement but to keep the game they put down some silver change. That they were seen playing Indicted and on his part plead guilty at the present term of the Court and was fined $20 -- He says when they got tired of playing each man took his money and quit as they began. That he did not intend to violate the Law by playing cards for money nor did they as they quit and each man took his money it only having been put down to keep the game but he says those who saw them playing could not tell but that they were actually playing for money. He says that he is not a gambler and never played cards for money and that he is too poore to pay the fine and do Justice to a large family He therefore asks that your Excellincy will remit the fine and he promises that he will not be guilty of a like indiscretion</p>
<p>John Bunch</p>
<p>The undersigned would join in asking that the fine be remitted</p>
