   <p>To His Excellency 
<lb/>Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky </p>
<p>Your Petitioner Julia Dean would respcetfully state, that she was indicted in <date when="1862-03">March 1862</date> in the city court of Louisville for keeping a disorderly House, &amp; on the <date when="1862-04-08">8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of April 1862</date> she was fined on said indictment $75<hi rend="sup">00</hi>/<hi rend="sub">00</hi>,</p>
<p>She humbly states that she is a widow, &amp; that her house was frequented by soldiers as they passed through the city, &amp; that she was unable to retrain their violence, &amp; from this cause her house gained the repute of disorderly. She states that she done all in her power to preserve order; but with men who had been subject for a long time, to riggid Military disciplin, it was an utter impossibility to controle them. When such men as these were permited by their officers to roam the city over, is it strange that any house they should frequent should gain the unenviable reput of disorderly,</p>
<p>Your Excellency will permit the sugjestion that all soldiers are disorderly &amp; riotous when permited to go where they please. </p>
<p>Your petitioner is a poor widow woman and unable to pay the fine imposed, &amp; she prays your Excellency to remit it.</p>
<p>With great respect
<lb/>I subscribe my self.
<lb/>Your obedient servant
<lb/>Julia ^her X mark^ Dean</p>
