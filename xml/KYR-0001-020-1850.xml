<p>Enclosed find a letter from Hon R. H. Stanton of Maysville <hi rend="underline">joining</hi> with me in soliciting your honor to remit a fine imposed on Jack Willett as pr his letter, on which I am bound as surety. This fine was imposed about two years since &amp; it was in my mind long since either remitted or paid off, but lately an execution has issued &amp; sent to the shriff of this county v.s. me Willett having gone to parts unknown. Governor I have lately paid heavy surety claims and it will distress me at this time to have this amount to pay therefore hope your honor will interpose in my behalf<pb/>
<lb/>The fine as the shriff inforcing me was sixty dollars -- The Execution is returnable in a few days &amp; hope iff not taxing you too much you will give me an early answer, &amp; will every pray &amp;c</p>
<p>I have the honor to Cer
<lb/>Your Friend
