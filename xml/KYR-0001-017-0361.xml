<lb/>To his Excellency Gov. Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I wish the appointment of Notary Public for Jefferson County. I held that office under the appointment of Gov. Powell some years ago but my commission has expired. I am a practicing lawyer in this city &amp; only wish the appointment for the convenience of taking the affidavits of my clients in the range of my own practice. For my character I refer you to Messrs Speed, Wolf, Beeman &amp; almost any one you may meet with in Frankfort from this city. If you will present my name to the Senate I will feel greatly obliged. Would it not be well to have a general law passed authorizing all regular attorneis to take the affidavits of their clients? I was accustomed to that arrangement in Carolina where I practiced many years. The gentlemen above referred to differ from me in politics but will doubtless do me Justice personally.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully yours -- 
<lb/>J. L. Clemmons<pb/></p>
