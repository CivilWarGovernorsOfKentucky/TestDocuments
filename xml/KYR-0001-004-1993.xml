   <p>To His Excellency the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner respectfully represents that he went upon the bail bond of James Gastlin guaranteeing his appearance in the Fayette Circuit Court at its ^last^ February term, to answer an indictment for "receiving stolen property, knowing it to be stolen," and that Gastlin ran away and Your petitioners bond was forfeited and he summoned to show cause at its present (June) term why judgment should not be rendered against him, for the amount thereof viz Three hundred Dollars,</p>
<p>Your petitioner says he is not able to pay this amount and gives as reasons why he should not be required to do so </p>
<p>1 That he applied to Your Secretary of State and obtained a requisition upon the Governor of Ohio for said Gastlin, secured his arrest and had him placed in the jail of Fayette County where he now is, to answer said indictment</p>
<p>2 That his expenses in securing the said Gastlin amounted to about Seventy five dollars, which is as much as your petitioner feels he ought to be required to pay.</p>
<p>3 That he has done all he could do to bring the prisoner to justice and not one thing to shield him from the punishment he<pb/>
<lb/>deserves if guilty. Wherefore Your petitioner respectfully prays that Your excellency will remit the whole amount in your control, <hi rend="underline">no</hi> <hi rend="underline">judgment</hi> <hi rend="underline">having</hi> <hi rend="underline">yet</hi> <hi rend="str">issued</hi> <hi rend="underline">been</hi> <hi rend="underline">entered</hi> <hi rend="underline">thereon</hi>,</p>
<p>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Smith</p>
<p>Thomas Smith says all the foregoing statements are true,</p>
<p>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Smith</p>
<p>W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi>. H. Lusby says he is Jailor of Fayette ^co^ and that James Gastlin, apprehended in Ohio under a requisition upon the Governer of that state, is now in the Jail of said County, <hi rend="str">placed</hi> <hi rend="str">there</hi> <hi rend="str">by</hi> <hi rend="str">his</hi> <hi rend="str">surity</hi> <hi rend="str">Thomas</hi> <hi rend="str">Smith</hi>, to answer an indictment for "receiving stolen property, <hi rend="str">knowing</hi> <hi rend="str">it</hi> <hi rend="str">to</hi> <hi rend="str">be</hi> <hi rend="str">stolen</hi>, That he does not know who procured his arrest</p>
