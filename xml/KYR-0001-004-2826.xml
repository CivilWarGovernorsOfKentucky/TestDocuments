<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Gov Bramlette</p>
<p>An Indictment for Tippling was found at the present term of our Circuit Court against James Black -- a colored man -- &amp;, although he could really have demurred the same out of Court, on account of his not being a free man, but as this might have prejudiced him in an other important matter, he did not choose thus to gratify those who were instrumental in indicting him, &amp; went into court &amp; confessed, &amp; now throws himself upon the mercy of your excellency for pardon.</p>
<p>The undersigned vouch for his character as an upright, industrious, &amp; really respected black man -- being an exception from the majority of his race, in all the elements of a good citizen, &amp; believeing, &amp; knowing the liquor to have been sold under peculiar circumstances through the agency of white men takeing advantage of him, they ask your excellency to remit the fine.</p>
