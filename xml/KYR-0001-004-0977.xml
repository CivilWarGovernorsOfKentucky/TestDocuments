<p>Dr Sir I presume that there has been a petition by John W. Baily of Edmonson County prosecuted to your favour able consideration to remit a fine of $200. assessed against him upon an indictment charging him with <hi rend="str">gamin</hi> permitting gaming in his Store house I was counsel for the petitioner and the proof Showned he had occasionally suffered some of the young men of the Town to over reach him &amp; game in his Store house he engaging in the Game; when he was under the influence of Whiskey (I say whiskey for I suppose they have nothing else there &amp; not good whiskey) and it was also clearly proven when under the influence of whiskey he was scarcely cognizance of what he or any one else were doing. The proof by every witness was he never suffered or permitted Gaming in his house when sober I am<pb/>
<lb/>Clarley satisfied from the proof of his case deserves executive clemency: the poor fellow has been unfortunate in merchansiding &amp; not able to pay the fine. from my acquaintance with him &amp; what the citizens of the Town tell me I am satisfied there is a screw loose some where in his head &amp; when under the influance of Liquor he is labouring under a species of insanity I am informed he wrote his petition himself if so I will venture you will from that discover some traces of mental allienation especially if in one of his talking modes when he wrote it</p>
