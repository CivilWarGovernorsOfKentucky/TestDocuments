<lb/>Col:</p>
<p>I will lay before you, for your consideration, a matter, which I think should be attended to -- </p>
<p>At the <date when="1863-08">August Election, 1863</date>, and in compliance with an <hi rend="underline">order</hi> issued by Lieut Col Johnson; who acted under the orders of Col Foster (65<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ind Vols) and who was at the time Comdg the Post here; Judges were appointed and sworn, to act agreeable, and according to Col Johnsons order, the tenor of which, was to let no one vote who was not in every respect, a truly Loyal citizen; unless he would first take the oath This exaction was made by the Marshal law then controlling and the Judges acted in obedience to its orders</p>
<p>During last cout, all the Judges presented to the Grand jury, which was Entirely secession; and two of the men, who presented the Judges were the, Circuit Judge, and the County Judge -- The entire Court was one of treason, and numberd out with traitors; and unless there is measures adopted for the benefit of<pb/>
<lb/>the Judges they will be apt to suffer, from the hands of such treasonable members which invariably form the Court here -- The Judges have appealed to me for assistance from the Military; and I am disposed ^to^ think that it would be nothing more than what we should do; since they were acting in obedience to Military law, and thus got themselves into the predicament; and therefore I think the military should get them out -- I am anxious to interfere in their be half, if I can legally do so; and information from you will decide that point</p>
<p>The <hi rend="underline">meanest</hi> set of secessionists that ever existed under the canopy of Heaven, live in this immediate section of Ky; and we must adopt means, &amp; severe ones too, to prevent a resistance which is almost sure to take place sooner or later, unless prevented</p>
<p>I will await your suggestions relative to this matter; and will surely try to execute any orders I may receive from you -- </p>
<p>If I had another Company here, I could pick up a number of guerrillas across the Tenn river -- Can get a Gun boat to assist me at any time</p>
<p>I am Sir your Obdt Sert

<p>The prosecution herein referred to being by Indictment, under the penal laws of the State, any fine inflicted would be for the benefit of the Commonwealth and the Prosecuting Attorney.

<p>Respectfully forwarded to Brig Gen.
