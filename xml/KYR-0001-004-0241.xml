<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Governor Bramlette
<lb/>Dr Sir</p>
<p>At the <date when="--04">April Term</date> of the Todd Circuit Court. John Bryan of this county was endited for breaking into a store House and carried away some Bottles of brandy of the value of six Dollars. his Father James Bryan became his Security in the sum of Five hundred Dollars for his appearance he failed to appear and at the last term of this court. Judgment weant against his Father for the amount forfeited. I am satisfied Bryan with some soldier stationed here in a drunken frolick broke through the window of Blacks Grocery and took the liquor and nothing else. Bryan then went off and joined the army as I am informed and believe His Father is a poor man with a large Family, he is industrious and hard working man. I am in hopes you may think proper to relieve him in whole or in part</p>
<p>Your Respt
