<lb/>Mr Green
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>There was no difficulty in getting a petition from here. As the jurors said it was the understanding before they left their room to sign a petition</p>
<p>The citizens all expressed a willingness to sign a petition hopeing he would be released</p>
<p>I stated what I knew about it, but I have been informed that the young ^man^ claimed that there was part of the money taken out, but more than I was informed of before but I can not think my husband was a thief or that he would intentionally wrong any person my prayer is that he m^a^y be released and restored to <hi rend="str">your</hi> his family, I did not get a statement of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Powell sickness but the doctor has written to the citty Physician in Frankfort as he said it would have more influence with the Governor what I received from you I will return as soon as I get back to Memphis. I will be very much obliged to you for presenting the papers to the Governor hopeing and praying it will prove successful</p>
<p>I have written a few lines to M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Powell and will enclose with the rest</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Martha, B, McCall<pb/></p>
