<lb/>Hon B MaGoffin
<lb/>Governor Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Mr, Neimiah Kitchen Stands convicted at the <date when="1860-10">oct Term 1860</date> of our Circuit Court for Keeping a Tipling house fined $60</p>
<p>I as Co atty prosecuted M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Kitchen before a Justice of the Peace &amp; fined him $60 for the <hi rend="underline">same</hi> unlawful selling</p>
<p>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Kitchen employed an attorny to plead the former conviction in <hi rend="underline">Bar</hi> -- but owing to the unskilfullness of his attory the plea did not avail him in the manner in which it was pleaded &amp; Judgment went against him It was agreed by the attony for the Commonwealth that should make this statement to your worship &amp; ask that the fine<pb/>
<lb/>be remitted My personal acquaintance with M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Kitchern is such as enables me to say to you that he is not a violater of the Law generally -- but is the reverse -- a good &amp; loyal Citizen &amp; has never to my Knowledge violated our penal Laws before. These are the facts in the case. If you ^now^ thinks this state of cause demands your clemency please direct the order remiting the fine to me at Louisa, so I can send it immediately to Mr Kitchen who lives in a remote part of the County &amp; who is very anxious to hear from his case</p>
<p>With sentiment of regard
<lb/>I am your obt Servt
<lb/>K. F. Prichard
<lb/>Co atty</p>
