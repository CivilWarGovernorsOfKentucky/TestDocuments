<lb/>Govenor Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed you will find the petition of Mary Ryan praying for the remission of a fine of $600 -- that was imposed by a Jury for Keeping a disorderly house.</p>
<p>A great many women were tried at this term of the court for the same offence &amp; the fines imposed were exceedingly excessive. I am not an advocate for women who Keep such houses, but I have that feeling in my heart that will not permit me to remain silent when I see Juries attempting to correct the morrals of our city by crushing poor unfortunate women.</p>
<p>I once appealed to Govenor Morehead in behalf of a woman of this kind &amp; he remitted the fine, &amp; said to me that he had never permitted an exorbitant fine to go unremitted when he was appealed to, His idea was that small fines should be<pb/>
<lb/>imposed, &amp; that the Govenor should not remit. This policy will redown to the interest of the Commonwealth by putting Money in to the Treasury, but where the fine is so exorbitant it becomes &amp; unjust hardship, &amp; the amount coming to the state is remitted &amp; a large <hi rend="str">fine</hi> amount goes to the City attorney.</p>
<p>If Juries are made to know that all large fines will be remitted by the Govenor, they then will impose reasonable fines &amp; they will be collected</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>J. Hop. Price</p>
<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Vanwinkle
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I enclose four dollars, which I believe is the necessary amount for two judgments. If the amounts are remitted direct to me.</p>
<p>Very Respty
<lb/>J. Hop. Price</p>
