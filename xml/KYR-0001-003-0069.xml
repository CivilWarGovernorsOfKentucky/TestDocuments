<lb/>Gov. Bramlette -- 
<lb/>Dear Sir -- </p>
<p>I regret exceedingly that so much publicity should have been given to what I supposed, was to have been a private arrangement between Col. Watkins &amp; myself. I had no idea of any application to the legislature of Ky for a loan for a few days. I supposed that you could use the money for the purpose for a short time upon your own responsibility. It seems that you were under a misapprehension. The Veterans of the 4th &amp; 6th Ky Cav. Regts were all paid at Bridgeport, Ala before they left camp. The unpaid men here were those who agreed to become Veterans, &amp; wanted pay for the two months ending <date when="1863-12-31">Dec 31. 1863</date>. I had neither money nor orders to pay for those months, but as Col W had promised the men the two months pay on arrival here, provided<pb/>
<lb/>they would agree to re-enlist when they became eligible, I told him I would pay them if he could raise the money, at once, &amp; refund in few days. These men were paid on the 21st &amp; 22<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> &amp; today I have deposited to the credit of the Trea<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> of the State of Ky at Bank of Ky, the money borrowed -- to wit $20.000.</p>
<p>Today I rec<hi rend="sup">d</hi> telegram from Pay Master General, directing me to "pay the 400 Veterans of the 6th &amp; 4th Ky. Cavly Regts. which the Gov. of Ky. has telegraphed as unpaid".</p>
<p>Over ten thousand Veterans have been paid in my pay district within the last thirty days, &amp; not one Regiment has left here without pay. But we do not pay those men who are not mustered out &amp; in as Veterans, altho there are many furlough'd.</p>
<p>Very Respy &amp; truly
<lb/>Your Obed Sevt.
<lb/>Wm. Allen
<lb/>Chief <unclear>Pay Mr</unclear> D. C.</p>
