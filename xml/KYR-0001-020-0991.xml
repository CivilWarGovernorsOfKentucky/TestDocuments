Not wishing to carry it in his hand he put it in his pocket &amp; carried it to Town and just before he delivered it up, it was seen by the witness William H Smith who indicted him at the <date when="1860-09">September</date> term of the Madison Circuit Court &amp; on the <gap/> day of <gap/> during the present <date when="1861-03">March</date> Term of said court.
