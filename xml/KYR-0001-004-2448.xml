  <body>
   <p>To His Excellency Thos E Bramblette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned members of the Court of the County of Montgomery &amp; the Bar Practising in Said Circuit Court, &amp; others would respectfully state -- that at the present term of the Circuit Court for the above County one Geo Wilson was indicted for the Crime of Horse Stealing -- committed in this County -- tried in Court, &amp; Convicted &amp; sentenced to imprisonement at hard labor for four years in the Penitentiary -- has been sent there &amp; a receipt of Harry I Todd Keeper of the same for the body filed in this Court. We would most respectfully ask the Clemency of the Executive, in his behalf for the reason, that in our opinion said Geo Wilson is an <hi rend="underline">exceedingly</hi> <hi rend="underline">simple</hi> <hi rend="underline">minded</hi> man -- represents that his home is in Wisconsin -- that he has served three years in the Federal Army=was discharged in <unclear/> &amp; seemed possessed with only one idea -- that of reaching his home -- It is a matter of serious doubt if said Wilson has or had at the time any idea, of what constituted a crime, or that he believes that he was committing any offence whatever against the law -- When overtaken he manifested no uneasiness of mind -- had sold the horse for $25 or $30 paid back the money without a word, &amp; seemed then &amp; has so ever since up to the time of his being sent from this place wholy unconscious of the fact that he was guilty of any offense whatever.<pb/>
<lb/>In view of all Circumstances connected with this case -- we respectfully ask your Excellency -- to grant a full &amp; free Pardon to this Young man -- set him at Liberty &amp; allow him the chance to return to his friends at his home in Wisconsin -- who may give him such instruction &amp; care, as will protect him in future.</p>

<p><milestone unit="column" n="1"/>I think it manifest from the facts proven on the trial and the demeanor of the prisoner George Wilson that he is a feeble-minded man and most proper object of Executive clemency.</p>
<p>R. Apperson Jr.</p>
<p>In the matter Every man who was on the Jury would sign this Paper if presented to him &amp; I think every other man who was in the House at the trial even the Witnesses also -- He is certainly a very simple youth -- had no money no Counsel &amp; no friends here -- <hi rend="underline">The</hi>-<hi rend="underline">Court</hi> here gave him Counsel Mssrs Hazelrigg &amp; Wrinn -- If this Boy can be sent to his friends at home -- he may do some service</p>
<p>Very Respectfuly
