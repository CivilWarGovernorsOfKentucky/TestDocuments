  <body>
   <p>To His Excellency, Thos. E. Bramlette,
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky;</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Trimble County Kentucky, would most respectfully and earnestly solicit, on the part of your Excellency, the exercise of executive clemency in behalf of our worthy fellow-citizen, Mr. Levi S. Baker, who was indicted and, at the <date when="1863-10">October Term 1863</date> of the Trimble Circuit Court, fined the sum of fifty dollars for carrying upon his person concealed ^a^ deadly weapon<hi rend="str">s</hi> (a pistol): we would beg to remind your Excellency that shortly thereafter, upon petition, your Excellency granted him a respite from the operation of said fine for the period of one year. That time having elapsed, of course the penalty will be enforced without Executive interposition. We would represent further that s'd Baker is a clever inoffensive citizen and that he is pecuniarily unable to pay the fine -- the costs he has paid -- and we should be grieved to witness the imprisonment of so good a man for an inadvertent violation of a law the enforcement whereof so frequently worked hardships even in peaceful times, and which in these times, is practically abrogated. We therefore pray Your Excellency to remit s'd fine and Your Petitioners will ever pray.</p>
