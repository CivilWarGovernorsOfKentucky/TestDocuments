   <p>Hopkinsville Ky <date when="1865-08-19">Aug 19. 1865</date></p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of the County of Christian and State of Kentucky, and neighbors of Richard Witty who was convicted of retailing spiritous liquors without license in this County at the <date when="1863-09">September term 186<hi rend="str">2</hi>3</date> of the Christian Circuit Court respectfully suggest to your excellency that said Witty is a poor man. That he enlisted in the army of the United States soon after the war of the rebellion broke out, and that he was soon after discharged for physical disability, and was compelled to return to Christian County: but was unable to stay at home &amp; make a living; because he had been in the army, and the county was in the possession of the Rebels: whom he was compelled to avoid -- and that under these circumstances and to prevent his family from suffering and during the time the County was <hi rend="str">not</hi> scarcely governed by law in anything, he bought a barrel of whiskey, and left it with his wife at his house for her to sell, &amp;<pb/>
<lb/>and for this offense he was fined the sum of Sixty dollars, for which amount with interest a <hi rend="underline">capias</hi> is now in force against him -- </p>
<p>In December last the Rebels took from him his only two horses, and he has been unable to make a crop. On this account and for the general reason that he has been a loyal man all the time, and has been greatly annoyed by the Rebels ever since the war began he has been kept very poor and scarcely able to support his family -- </p>
<p>In consideration of these facts, and of the slight grade of offense which he committed we humbly but earnestly beg your Excellency to remit This fine which has been imposed upon him -- </p>
<p>Very Respectfully -- 
<lb/>To
<lb/>His Excellency
