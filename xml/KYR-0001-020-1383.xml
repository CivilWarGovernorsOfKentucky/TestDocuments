   <p>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin, Governor of Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>The undersigned would respectfully represent unto your Excellency that on the <date when="1861-09-19">19th. inst.</date> he was fined by his Honor, the Mayor of the City of Maysvile, the sum of Fifty Dollars for the offence of selling spiritous Liquor by the dram without license.</p>
<p>He states that he is keeping a small grocery store in said city, by which he has been endeavoring to earn a living for himself and family. He admits that he violated the law of the city the demands of his family for subsistence having forced him to do so. He states that he is poor, and unable to pay said fine, and the payment of it would sweep from him his little stock of groceries and place his family a charge upon the public. The cessation of labor, &amp; the stagnation of business has already thrown upon him burdens which he can scarcely bear, and not having money to even maintain his family he humbly prays your Excellency to interpose and remit said fine, for which he and his family will ever be grateful.</p>
<p>Maysville, Ky, <date when="1861-09-20">Sept. 20th. 1861. </date></p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Patrick Keiffee</p>
<p>The undersigned, citizens of Maysville state that are acquainted with the petitioner Patrick Keiffe, and unite in the above prayer.</p>
<p>Respectfully,
<lb/>W W Baldwin
