   <p>To his Excellency James F. Robinson
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your petitioners respectfully represent to your excellency that the fine ag<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> William Able, rendered in the case of the Commonwealth vS. Able in the Louisville Police Court ^Should be remitted.^ The fine was upon a forfeited recognizance. Said Able having been recognized to appear as a witness in said Court &amp; failed to appear. We have every reason to believe, &amp; do believe that said ^Able^ was sick at the time he failed to appear, &amp; was confined to his bed by sickness &amp; has been confined to his house ever since.</p>
<p>respectfully.</p>
<p>Mr Able forfeited a recognizance in the City Court of Louisville having been recognized in the sum of $100, to appear as a witness in the behalf of the comlth Mr Able is an old man, &amp; a resident of Jefferson County some 12 miles from Louisville. Judging from the certificate of his Physician, who is well known, &amp; think the fine should be remitted</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>W, G, Reasor
