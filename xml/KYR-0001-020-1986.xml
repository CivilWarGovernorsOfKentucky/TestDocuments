   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Thomas Jackson states that at the <date when="1862-02">Feby Term 1862</date> of the Fayette Circuit Court two indictments were rendered against him &amp; one for keeping a tippling house &amp; the other for keeping a disorderly house -- At the <date when="1862-06">June term 1862</date> the indictment for keeping a disorderly house was tried &amp; he was acquitted, On the trial the only evidence against him among the numerous witnesses examined by the Commonwealth was the proof of Davis who said he he purchased whisky 3 times &amp; Sanders who had purchased only once &amp; while all the other witnesses on both sides found that he had always refused to sell liquor in quantities less than a quart. Upon this testimony he was advised that on the indictment for keeping a tippling house, he would be fined and to save cost it would be best to admit a judgement, Although he was not guilty he consented to said judgemnent and now prays your excellency to remit the fine. He desires that he sold whisky to Sanders, Davis or any one to be drunk in his house -- He denies that he kept a tippling house, He keeps a grocery &amp; private entertainment and has an orderly house -- The witness Sanders had quarrelled with him &amp; was<pb/>
<lb/>under a bail bond, because of his threats against petitioner. </p>
<p>Your petitioner prays a remission of said fine</p>
<p>Thomas Jackson </p>
<p>The undersigned unite in this petition and ask a remission of the fine of Thomas Jackson. </p>
