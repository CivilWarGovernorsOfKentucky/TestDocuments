That the verdict of the Jury was against him and he was adjudged to confinemet in the Penitentiary for two years and that he is now suffering that penalty,</p>
<p>Your petitioners would state that s<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> Johnson is an old man with a family ^consists^ of his wife and several children, That the proof though considered strong enough to <hi rend="str">him guilty</hi> authorize the verdict against him was not <hi rend="str">of</hi> conclusive against him,</p>
<p>In consideration of his age, and of the wants and condition of his family who we understand to be desirous to move to ^the state of^ Pennsylvania and of the possibility of his being innocent of the charge the undersigned would most earnestly but respectfully urge <hi rend="str">upon</hi> the exercise of executive clemancy in his case and grant his pardon and restoration to liberty.</p>
