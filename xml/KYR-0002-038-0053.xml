<lb/><date when="1864-03-11">March 11" 1864</date>.
<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>The Govnor of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I would respectfully submit the following to Your gracious consideration.</p>
<p>There has been appointed and commissioned as 1" Lieut in Simmonds 1" Indp<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Ky. Battery of Light Artillery (over two (2) 2" Lieut who have seen service as officers over two (2) Years. one (1) of said Lieuts have commanded the Battery fourteen (14) or Eighteen (18) Month.) a Sergeant By name (Ja<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> B. Flack) one of Cap<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Simmonds favorites as this Serg<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> has been one of the Cap<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> principal agents in his <unclear/> on Government having been A. Q M. Sergeant when Cap<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Simmonds was act A. Q. M.</p>
<p>This Flack! <hi rend="underline">Personally</hi>! -- is of very low origin. Lazy, Slovenish. and Dirty. he is as unprincipled as he is Dirty. he is a consummated Vilin, or at least a scheming Rascle.</p>
<p>He has done all in his power to discourage re-enlistments in the Battery. both by Example and advice. Though he proposed to the undersigned that if -- he could get a commission he himself would re-enlist.</p>
<p>These facts have been written to Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Boyle, but it has had no Effect. Though they can and will be proven if this Man (Flack) should be Mustered. which is not the case yet, as the command is not entitled to an other Lieut. in it's present Diminished Number<pb/>
<lb/>Though there are but two (2) 2" Lieut now on Duty in the Command nor has there been for nearly twenty (20) Months</p>
<p>Hoping the above will meet your earliest attention and kind consideration</p>
<p>I have the honor to remain
<lb/>With much Respect
<lb/>Your Obdt Sevt
