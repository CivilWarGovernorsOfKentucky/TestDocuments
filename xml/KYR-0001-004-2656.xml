<lb/>Gov Thos. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort
<lb/>Ky
<lb/>Dear Governor</p>
<p>Your letter received, and matter will be attended to in time -- I will see you as soon as I can get away -- </p>
<p>I write this morning in behalf of my old friend and neighbor James E. Gillespie, formerly of Boyle, now of Washington Co, who goes to see you, begging your clemency in behalf of his son Henry Gillespie, who has been convicted to six years &amp; six months imprisonment for manslaughter -- the killing of J B. Lawrence in Washington Co. Ky.</p>
<p>I know M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gillespie to be one of the best of men -- I know all his family -- His three boys were in the Federal Army and served their time in the field and in rebel prisons, except Henry, who was discharged honorably -- He was<pb/>
<lb/>a true patriot and a good and faithful soldier -- He was when a youth a most excellent young man and as his misfortune deserves consideration -- He has a wife and child -- dependant on him for a support -- His father is poor and scarcely able to defray the expense of going to Frankfort to implore mercy for his son, and to beg you to pardon him -- I am persuaded from the record, and from my knowledge of the character of young Gillespie that it is a case for exercise of Executive clemency -- The testimony of Powell and <unclear/> on pages 33 and 34, show excuse for Gillespie<hi rend="sup">s</hi> shooting, and unquestionably casts such resonable doubt as to have entitled him to acquital -- It was no doubt the result of too free use of spirits, but it is still a case of interpotion and doubt, and for executive clemency Considering all the facts, the character of the young man, my knowledge of him, his conduct for this past three years, and the confidence that may be reposed on his future good conduct, I appeal to you on his behalf with confidence and hope.</p>
<p>I would come in person and make the appeal, with the record in the case, but I can not leave for several days -- I do hope you<pb/>
<lb/>may be able, with a sense of your duty, to pardon the young man, and gladden the heart of his venerable father, himself and his wife and friends -- </p>
<p>I believe this is a case for exercise of clemency and mercy, and I beg you will examine the record and petitions at your earliest opportunity and relieve the poor old man from the further anxiety and expense.</p>
<p>Very Truly
<lb/>Your Friend &amp; obt srvt
<lb/><hi rend="underline">J. T. Boyle</hi></p>
