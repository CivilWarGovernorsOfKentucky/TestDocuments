<lb/>Rockcastle County, <date when="1862-08-21">Wed. aug. <hi rend="underline">21</hi> 1862</date>, 9 p.m.
<lb/>Capt. S. B. Brown.</p>
<p>I have ascertained to a certainty <hi rend="str">to a certainty</hi> that the rebels are in great force at and below London. About 1000 Cavalry at London and three or four thousand infantry beyond there towards Barboursville. I have seen several there who were prisoners, and four different men who were with waggons tell me that they laid in the woods and saw the infantry passing for half a day towards Barboursville. They have destroyed everything south of here and we are feeding the last corn we can get: we cannot live here -- there is nothing more for horses -- it is all nonsense to talk about feeding the little patches of green corn to our horses, that would starve the women &amp; children &amp; kill our horses.</p>
<p>There are also four hundred rebels at M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Vernon. They are threatening me from both positions &amp; some danger of them getting between me &amp; Richmond.</p>
<p>The Country is pefectly desolated. How the people are to live here I can't see.</p>
<p>My position here is not tenable. The force in front is overwhelming, and we can get nothing more for our horses &amp; nothing for ourselves in another day or two, &amp; no support following me that I know of; assistance must<pb/>
<lb/>come quickly or the position at Cumberland gap will be lost and heavy forces will be marching on Richmond &amp; Lexington.</p>
<p>Now gentlemen stir yourselves or you go up. This is no idle talk you must wake up to the danger of your position.</p>
<p>Starvation will compel me to retire to where I can get provisions which I will do slowly, expecting to have assistance sent speedily.</p>
<p>Telegraph the substance of this to the Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> and send this letter to him.</p>
<p>If there were no forces in front of us we could not live here: everything destroyed.</p>
