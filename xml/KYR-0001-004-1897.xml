<lb/>His Excellency Thos. E. Bramlett
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir: -- </p>
<p>A young man by the name of Thomas H. Skeens is now confined in the Kentucky state prison, His father James Skeens comes to Frankfort for the purpose of Soliciting Executive clemency in favor of his son -- </p>
<p>I have been acquainted with said Thomas H. Skeens for more than Twelve years, last past, He was a very industrious well behaved and orderly young man, He enlisted in the Service in the Summer of <date when="1861">1861</date>, in 20<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Regt. Ky. Vols. He had the reputation of being one of the best soldiers in the regiment. Both officers and men praised him for good conduct and bravery at all times, He had re-inlisted as a veteran some time<pb/>
<lb/>before he was arrested in Louisville If guilty of the offense for which he has been sent to the State prison, He must have been led into it by associates or must have fallen into bad company for he has uniformily Sustained a character above the suspicion of crime.</p>
<p>He has lived in this county for many years, in fact, was almost raised here and every body that knows him will testify to his good character industry and good morals -- </p>
<p>The petition which his father will present to your Excellency is Signed principally by citizens who live here and who know the young man -- and the greater portion of their signatures I know to be genuine.</p>
<p>I am very Respt.
<lb/>Your obt Servant
