   <p>To His Excellency B Magoffin Govenor &amp;c
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Allow me to introduce to you Mrs White the mother of the unfortunate boy Mortimer Peck, She visits you for the purpose of obtaining a pardon for her boy He has been in jail already for about four months He has been very unfortunate in his habits evidently which has led to his present disgrace, I am Satisfied it is by all means better for him if he would be reclaimed to be set at liberty I know he nor his friends have anything to pay the fine and really think his a very suitable case for the interference of Executive Clemency. On the petition you will find the names of Eight of the jurors, all I understand who have been waited upon Mrs. White is a very estimable<pb/>
<lb/>lady reduced to want but honest and upright a lady of fine intellect and good attainments of refined sensibilities, and on her account as well as his I hope you will consider her suit with favor.</p>
<p>Yours truly
<lb/><hi rend="underline">C, <unclear/></hi></p>
