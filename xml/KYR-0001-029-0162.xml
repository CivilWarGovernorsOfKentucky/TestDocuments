   <p>Frankfort Ky.
<lb/><date when="1863-01-31">Jan 31<hi rend="sup">st</hi> 1863</date>,
<lb/>To His Excellency, James F. Robinson, Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Whereas, it is known to us, the undersigned your petitioners, that the <hi rend="underline">Subject</hi> of this memorial, who was confined in the penitentiary of the State of Kentucky on the <date when="1859-10-25">25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of Oct. A. D. 1859</date>, under sentence of court by judgment of conviction in Jefferson Cir. for the term of <hi rend="underline">ten</hi> <hi rend="underline">years</hi>, &amp; for the crime of burglary, has up to this day served faithfully in execution of said sentence of conviction, and, at all times, without murmering or repining, but, with apparent cheeerful: and, though <hi rend="underline">blind</hi> for fourteen years, without the possibility of recovery of his sight has never, to our knowledge, shirk from any duty; but in strict obedience to orders acting faithfully,</p>
<p>That <hi rend="underline">your</hi> <hi rend="underline">prisoner,</hi> <hi rend="underline">Charles Sullivan</hi>,<pb/>
<lb/>being in no sense a pauper, but, of right in possession of ample means for a comfortable maintenance and that his family and friends in the City of Louisville being in circumstances of pecuniary independence; we, feel not onlly safe in asking his restoration to liberty, but, earnestly, and anxiously pray <hi rend="underline">Your</hi> <hi rend="underline">Excellency</hi> to grant in his behalf this <hi rend="underline">Executive</hi> <hi rend="underline">clemency</hi> </p>
<p>In asking the consideration of Your Excellency upon our petition, we feel that it is <unclear/> we ask pardon, if it shall seem incompatible with the publlic welfare to grant our prayer. But. we believe the object, one of mercy: which if granted, will confer an inestimable favor upon the <hi rend="underline">poor</hi> <hi rend="underline">blind</hi> <hi rend="underline">prisoner</hi>: almost the only comfort left to<pb/>
<lb/>an afflicted sister who had, of physical comforts in plenty, but pines for the Society of the brother of her infancy</p>
<p>Considering these facts: viz. the invalidity of your prisoner, the evidence of the end of the judgment, and the favor it will confer upon an afflicted sister, to restore by the Executive pardon, one so needy and really worthy, we believe will be a subject of commendation by all good people, and a sense of gratification, at any rate to us your memorialists.</p>
<p>We therefore trusting to the native goodness of Your Excellency, shall feel safe with this representation to you and satisfied with its determination and may Heaven bless those named.<pb/></p>
