<lb/>To his Excllency Gov. Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I address you this letter in behalf of Geo. W Thompson, who was fined for selling Sprituous Liquors to a minor Some three or more years since and Petitioned your predecessor for a remittance, but he only respited the fine for a time and now there is an Execution in the hands of the Shiriff for the amt due to the Com,w'th he having paid the Attys fee and costs hopes that you will see his original Petition and if consistent remit the amt due the state, Geo W Thompson is less able he says to pay now than he was when the fine was assessed, As he has been Sick and lingered long with the worst kind of case of small Pox; which cost him a good deal, he has not been fined since and is a verry clean gentleman and a compliance will never be forgotten by him</p>
<p>Respectfully Yours,
<lb/>S. C. Perrin.</p>
<p>N. B. Enclosed please find $2,00 the fee in case the fine is remitted please answer soon</p>
<p>S. C. Perrin</p>
