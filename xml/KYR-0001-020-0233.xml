<lb/>Dear Gov -- </p>
<p>I was shown a petition to day signed by a number of Citizens of this County, asking the pardon of Dr. Milton Mize, who stands charged with passing counterfeit money</p>
<p>The cause has been pending for some years, no trial has been Had. I am not fully acqainted with all the facts in the case. Cannot say that He could be convicted. the witnesses against Him are scattered in vairous parts of the country, it is very difficult to get them all at court at one time -- It is a very Expensive prosecution -- Dr Mize <hi rend="str">is very</hi> <hi rend="str">respectfully</hi> is well connected -- His relatives are generally as Highly regarded as any persons in the mountains -- This is the only charge that I have ever Heard against Him; From my acquaintances with him I have doubted His sanity -- </p>
<p>So far as I am posted the petition contains the truth, in every particular -- a pardon would give very general satisfaction</p>
<p>respectfully
<lb/>Your obt Servt.
