<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Govr. Bramlette -- </p>
<p>The woman Mrs Cosden who presents a petition to you for the pardon of her husband is very poor, has infant children, and we believe is an honest and religious woman -- </p>
<p>Her husband was indicted for stealing meat &amp; potatoes &amp; some other things from a flat boat. There were some doubts about his guilt in our minds and he was compelled to go to trial without a witness.</p>
<p>The Jury found him guilty &amp; Fixed his term<pb/>
<lb/>in the Penetentiary at one year.</p>
<p>His wife is anxious to obtain his release -- Her Petition is well signed. The two persons owning the property said to have been stolen are among the signers. Their names are William Wadell &amp; Thomas O'Hern</p>
<p>Mr. Turner who made the arrest also signed the petition -- </p>
<p>If you can pardon him it ^will^ gratify the friends of the unfortunate lady who presents the petition.</p>
<p>Most Respectfully
<lb/>Baird &amp; Price
<lb/>Attos at Law
<lb/></p>
