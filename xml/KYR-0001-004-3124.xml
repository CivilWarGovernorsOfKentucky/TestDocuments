<p>To his excellency Thomas E. Bramlette Gov &amp;c</p>
<p>At the present session of the Circuit Court of Fayette County, Robert Haydon, a colored man, was convicted of Grand Larceny, and sentenced to one years imprisonment in the Penitentiary. The proof was that a ham weighing some 25 pounds was stolen a ham was found in his possession, which was identified to the satisfaction of the jury as the stolen ham, but which identificatin was hardly conclusive. The specie value of the meat stolen was known to be about $4.16 just barely making the crime grand larceny This negro has been in ail already over two months and a half. His family need his services: his previous character has been good: his punishment has been already ample, and we respectfully represent that the case presents a proper one for Executive clemency. While it is true that the law ought not to be broken with impunity by negroes, it is equally true that no greater severity of punishment ought to be inflicted upon these poor ignorant creatures than upon white offenders</p>
<p>Your petitioners will ever pray &amp;c
