   <p>To His Excellency the Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> of Ky.</p>
<p>The undersigned represent that Mason-Brown Parker, a very respectable, clever gentleman has been fined at the present <date when="--10">Oct<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">o</hi></hi></date> T. of the Mason Circuit Court, for permitting gaming in his house, the sum of $200. This fine falls heavily on M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parker who is a poor man, &amp; is peculiarly a hard case, as he has been absent for most of the time during the last six months, &amp; when the offense was committed for which he has been fined: yet it seems this would not exonerate him in the eye of the law, we therefore respectfly request y<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Excly to remit the fine, as the sum to be paid the att<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">o</hi></hi> for the Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> will be quite heavy, &amp; as much as M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Parker can afford to pay.</p>

<p>In this case the party fined does not remain at Maysville or know what is going on -- He rents this place of business to enable a personal friend to earn a support. This friend has not lived<pb/>
<lb/>to his contract but he is not able to pay the fine Were I Governor I would remit this fine but Mr Parker would have to close his house or remain at it and see that the law was not violated I recommend the Executive to <hi rend="underline">remit</hi> this fine</p>
