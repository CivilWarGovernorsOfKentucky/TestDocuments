<lb/>Gov Bramlett
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Herewith I send you the petition of Noll &amp; Jones for pardon. The petition has been signed by a large portion of the best Citizens of our County, irrespective of political parties &amp; former prejudices.</p>
<p>The fathers of these two young men are poor and not able to expend large sums of money in conducting the defence of their sons. They are both unwaveringly loyal to the government; and one of them (Nall) during the war lost all he was worth in consequence of his loyalty.</p>
<p>The statements in the petition in regard to the immediate circumstances of the killing I have no doubt are true. And the statements in regard to Dials character I know to be true. In view of all the circumstances I think if there ever was a case which merited the intervention of Executive Clemency that this is one.</p>
<p>Please let me here from you at your<pb/>
<lb/>earliest convenience &amp; oblige</p>
<p>Your Obdt Serv
<lb/>C, W, Cook</p>
