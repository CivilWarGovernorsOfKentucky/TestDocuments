   <p>To His Excellency Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E. Bramlette Governor of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Anderson County and neighbours of A C Thomas would respectfully ask of your Excellency to release the said Thomas of a fine of 60 dollars which was adjudged against him at the <date when="1864-07">July Term of 1864</date> of the Anderson Circuit Court for keeping a tippling House, -- We are satisfied that it will be oppressive on him to collect this fine off him -- He is a poor man with a family entirely dependant on him for support, which he has to do by his labor -- That he is an industrous and sober man, and a good citizen and is far from wishing to violate the law as any man -- We therefore earnestly but respectfully ^ask^ that you will release him of his fine, for we know that it will be oppressive and distressing to himself &amp; family for the Same to be collected of him -- </p>
