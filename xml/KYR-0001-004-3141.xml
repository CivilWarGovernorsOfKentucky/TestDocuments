   <p>Governor Thos. E Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>My young friend Mr Laf<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">e</hi></hi> Joseph. goes to Frankfort in a new mission of charity. to obtain a pardon for an unworthy brother of the long robe.</p>
<p>He asked me to give him a few lines along, thinking that I have some influence with you in matters of pardon, upon the simple ground. that I never sign petitions for mercy, such as are usually circulated.</p>
<p>I would ask your kind consideration of Mr. L. E. Meyer's case, as I am fully convinced, that he was sacrificed to the ambition of some of his volunteers counsel in short, he was made a stalking horse for showing off <hi rend="str">some</hi> Southern eloquence A plain common sense defence would most likely have cleared him, as you will see by the statement of facts, signed by Judge &amp; Attorney. Having drawn on his brother, &amp; telling Mess. Pelle, Knoop &amp; Co not to present his check till next day. it looked very much like the representation of a future event But this seemed to plain: something more fanciful had to be put up for a defense &amp; he was slaughtered.
