<lb/>Gov. Bramlitte
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I may perhaps be a stranger to you, apparently but I have often seen you but in humble positions still you may recollect me. I am Engaged in the practice of Law here and have been for the last 12 years having served as presiding Judge and Clerk of the Kenton County Court. In my practice I find it frequently inconvienent to have affadavits taken and particularly at this time in fixing up papers that go before the provost Marshall &amp;c</p>
<p>Therefore I would be pleased and accomodated to have you send me a commission as Notary Publick for Kenton County and in so doing you will oblige</p>
<p>Your <hi rend="underline">friend</hi>
<lb/>S. C Perrin</p>
<p>N B. Lafayette Brafford sent a Petition to be relieved of a fine of one hundred dollars assessed against him at the <date when="1865-03">March Term of Our Kenton Circuit Court 1865</date> will you please see his Petition I think you would do him an act of Justice in remitting so far as you can his fine please direct to me</p>
<p>Yours
<lb/>S. C. Perrin<pb/>
