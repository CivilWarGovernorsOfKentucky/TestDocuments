<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>There was some difficulty here the other day on the occasion of firing guns in honor of Major Anderson and some of the dirty submissionists were very much incensed at Foster Tim Berry &amp; others for talking &amp; acting as they did which was nothing minor less than announcing that they believe the orthodox doctrine of the right to secede. Some two or three of them out of pure malice had him arrested for carrying concealed weapons and Ed Hawkins find him fifteen dollars on this day, which I have gone security for &amp; will have to pay unless Beriah does something for me to kind enough to attend to it for me. and I will remain as ever your most Kindly</p>
<p>A. S. Berry</p>
<p>P. S. I have written to Beriah for myself</p>
