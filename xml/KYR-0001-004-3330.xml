   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>The Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned, citizen of Indiana, respectfully represent that the bearer, G. W T. Safford is an honest, meritorious and respectable citizen of said state, who visits your Excellency with the view of providing a pardon for his brother in law, James Woodward ^who^ is now confined the Penitentiary of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Woodward was, as they understand, convicted at Louisville, in <date when="1863-06">June 1863</date>, of horse stealing From what the undersigned have been able to learn, they are inclined strongly to the opinion that Woodworth, who had been in the army for some time, had concluded that it was not a violation of the civil law for him to take property as a soldier, and that the horse was taken under this erroneous impression.</p>
<p>The undersigned are personally acquainted with Mr Woodward before he entered the army, and they can truly say that he was, up to that time, regarded as a straight forward, steady &amp;<pb/>
<lb/>reliable young man.</p>
<p>If compatible with the laws and interests of the people of Kentucky, Mr Woodward could be pardoned the balance of term of service, it would be greatly gratifying to his aged Mother &amp; his sister, who are very deserving &amp; highly respectable, and also to the undersigned.</p>
