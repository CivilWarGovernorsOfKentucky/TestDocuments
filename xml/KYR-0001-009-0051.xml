   <p>THE STATE OF WISCONSIN.
<lb/><figure type="seal"><ab>FORWARD</ab></figure>
<lb/>BOND-CHANDLER.
<lb/>BY JAMES T. LEWIS, GOVERNOR.<figure type="hr"/>
<lb/>THANKSGIVING PROCLAMATION.<figure type="hr"/></p>
<p>Peace again smiles upon us. The work of death has ceased. The authority of the Government has been fully established, and traitors, who once defied it, now bow in humble submission. The accursed institution of African slavery has perished. The Union established by our fathers, cemented anew by the blood of their patriot sons, send forth a brighter and purer light to the oppressed of other lands.</p>
<p>The people of our State have enjoyed the blessings of health and prosperity, and the privileges of education and divine worship. Our territory has not been polluted by the tread of the invader. Our substance has been preserved.</p>
<p>For these, and the many other favors and blessing which our Heavenly Father in His goodness has vouchsafed to us, in providing for our wants and guarding us from danger, we should thank and praise Him. While we enjoy the gift let us not forget the giver.</p>
<p>Feeling that we should express our gratitude and thankfullness for all these favors and blessings, I, JAMES T. LEWIS, Governor of the State of Wisconsin, in accordance with a time-honored custom, do hereby appoint
<lb/>Thursday, the <date when="1865-11-30">30th day of November, A. D. 1865</date>,
<lb/>a day of Thanksgiving, Prayer and Praise to Almighty God; and do recommend to the people that they meet on that day, in their usual places of worship, and
<lb/>"Praise God from whom all blessings flow,"
<lb/>thank Him for His goodness towards us during the year that has passed, and ask for the continuance of his favors and blessings.</p>
<p>[L. S.]</p>
<p>Given under my hand and the seal of the State in Executive Chamber at Madison, this <date when="1865-10-28">28th day of October, in the year of our Lord one thou-sand eight hundred and sixty-five</date>.</p>
<p>James T. Lewis.
<lb/>BY THE GOVERNOR:
<lb/>LUCIUS FAIRCHILD, Secretary of State.</p>
