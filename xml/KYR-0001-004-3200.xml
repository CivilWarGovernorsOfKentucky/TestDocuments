<lb/>Hon Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Gov of Kentucky</p>
<p>We would respectfully represent to your excellency that at the <date when="--05">May term</date> of the Graves Circuit Court Judgment was rendered against N C Pitman committing for a breach of the peace for $25 and at the <date when="--11">present Nov term</date> <hi rend="str">another</hi> another judgment was rendered against him for $5 for breach of the peace committed in <date when="1863">1863</date> during the great excitement of the War. Mr Pittman belonged to Gregory's state Guard and was a bold fearless advocate of the Union cause which we believe to be the cause of his being indicted scarcely a union man in this disloyal part of Kentucky has escaped a persecution from a rebel as the Law is in the hands of Rebels who use it as a Machine to oppress union men our only hope is to look to your Excellency for pardon and as Mr Pitman is a poor man we would earnestly ask that you interpose in his behalf and relieve him as far as you can</p>
