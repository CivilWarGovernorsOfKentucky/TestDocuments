<lb/>Hon Thos E Bramlett
<lb/>Governor of Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir;</p>
<p>I have at last obtained the Replevin Bonds upon which the executives issued against Col. Hennin and Chas Dupere, which bonds were given in satisfaction of bail Exin v. Heiner. You remember when I saw you the difficulty was that you did not have copies of the replevin Bonds.</p>
<p>I am in hopes you will exercise your clemency in behalf of these parties. The only name that Garis did not appear, was that when the war broke out, he was in Memphis, and was taken away by the Confederate conscription. It is hard that these two parties should shuffer by Garis.</p>
<p>Your Very Respy
