   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Gov Bramlette -- </p>
<p>The undersigned says he is a manufacturer of Cigars in Cincinnati</p>
<p>That some months ago he was in Lexington Ky, and there, without dreaming he was violating any law, showed some of his Cigars openly to several dealers, and on then being pleased sold some to several, Recintly on coming to Lexington he was arrested for offering to sell by sample goods manufactured out of the state, and was fined by the County Judge one hundred dollars &amp; costs -- which amount he has handed to the Judge who promises to hold until a remission of the fine could be solicited from you, The Judge himself declared that he did not think I had intentionally violated the law.</p>
<p>Under the Circumstances I beg your excellency to relieve me as far as you can of the fine, I am a young<pb/>
<lb/>man just beginning life and the loss would be very great to me.</p>
<p>I am very Respectfully
<lb/>Your obt St
<lb/>S. Euphrat

<p>I was counsel of Mr Euphrat in the above case, and I do not believe there was any purpose in him to violate the law -- </p>
<p>Geo B Kinkead</p>
<p>I concur in the above, &amp; hope your Excellence will remit the fine</p>
<p>W. S. Downey</p>
<p>I do not believe Mr Euphrat intended to violate the Peddlers act though in my <unclear>judgment</unclear> he do so in several instances under the law and therefore join in the recommendation for a remission of the fine except officers fees &amp; &amp; costs</p>
