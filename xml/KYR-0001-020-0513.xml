   <p>Felix Mion was fined twelve months ago in three cases -- for selling liquor to slaves, one case thirty five dollars -- one twenty five dollars &amp; one Fifty dollars -- The two first he has paid -- The last he wants the Governor to remit -- I was counsel for Mion, and although the proof was against him, yet it was plain that he was ignorant of the law upon the Subject -- He is a foreigner, can only speak part of our language -- had but recently come to the Country -- He is quiet, peaceable &amp; poor man with a wife, and two small children, &amp; his wifes mother to support -- and is industrious &amp; honest -- To remit the fine would in my Judgt be a proper exercise of Executive Clemency.</p>
