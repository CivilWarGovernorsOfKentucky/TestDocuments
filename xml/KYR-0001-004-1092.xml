   <p>Bowling Green Ky <date when="1864-08-03">3 August 1864</date>
<lb/>Gov Bramlette,
<lb/>Frankfort Ky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>A Petition will Shortly be presented you, Asking the remission (to the extent of your Constitutional power,) of a fine, on forfeiture, of the Warren Circuit Court. Against H P. Allen for engaging in the business of a broker, and exchange dealer, without license; the fine being $1050..</p>
<p>Although Mr Allen violated the revenue laws, as charged in the Indictment, the Circumstances attending the Case are peculiar, and in my opinion present strong reasons for executive Clemency.</p>
<p>Mr A engaged in said business during the time the rebel Army occupied and invested Bowling Green, in the winter of <date when="1861">1861</date>-<date when="1862">2,</date> at a time when the said Army was flooding this Country with Southern Currency and Confederate trash,<pb/>
<lb/>Called money, and when a license could not have been obtained, from the regular and legitimate Clerk of the County Court, without danger of arrest, and maltreatment, by the Said Army. By trading in that Currency however, the citizens of the Country were enabled to dispose of the otherwise worthless Currency which the army forced upon them, to him, and thus avoid irreparable injury. His business was for those reasons, of signal benefit to the Community. And for those reasons. I am fully satisfied the interposition of the executive would be Just and proper.</p>
<p>Respectfully &amp; C.
<lb/>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> B Jones Atty
<lb/>for the Comth.</p>
<p>Remit</p>
  </body>
