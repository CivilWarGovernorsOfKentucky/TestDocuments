<p>The petition of Charles Eaves and M. D.

That said Hartman failed to appear at the next term, having left the State, without <hi rend="str">the knowledge of your</hi> any connivance on the part of your petitioners. That said Hartman at the date of said recognizance resided in the town of Greenville, Ky, and pledged his word to your petitioners not to leave the state, and to appear in discharge of his recognizance at the next term of the court. That your petitioners have received information, which they believe to be true, that said Hartman removed to the State of <hi rend="str">Missouri</hi> ^Iowa^, and there enlisted as a soldier in the volunteer service of the United States, and was killed in battle at the battle of <hi rend="str">Wilsons creek</hi> ^Shilo^. <hi rend="str">That said prosecution against Hartman has been tried.</hi> Wherefore, as your petitioners are poor and have families to support, they respectfully ask your Excellency to remit said Judgment on said forfeited recognizance</p>
