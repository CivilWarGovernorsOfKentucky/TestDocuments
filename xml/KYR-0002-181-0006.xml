   <p>Headquarters Kentucky National Legion,
<lb/>INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE,
<lb/>Frankfort, Ky., <date when="1865-05-08">May 8, 1865</date>.
<lb/>GENERAL ORDER
<lb/>No. 3.</p>
<p>For the purpose of expediting the organization of the Companies of Active Militia for the Kentucky National Legion, it is <hi rend="italic">Ordered:</hi> That when <hi rend="italic">forty</hi> recruits have been obtained, they may be organized with one officer -- a First Lieutenant -- and mustered into the service of the State; they will be immediately called into active service, and furnished with arms, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Officers engaged in recruiting Companies will notify me as soon as they obtain forty recruits, and officers will be appointed to hold the election and muster them into the State service.</p>
<p>Where a full Company can be recruited in a short time, it will be better to defer the organization until the number is obtained.</p>
<p>By order of the Governor.
<lb/>W. H. HAYS,
<lb/><hi rend="italic">Inspector General of Kentucky.</hi></p>
