   <p>To his Excellency Governor Robinson</p>
<p>Your petitioner Reuben Malone (a free man of color) states he was induced to become the surety in a recognisance of Betsey Cowan (a free woman of color) conditioned that she should appear to answer a charge of felony at the <date when="1862-05">May Term 1862</date> of the Adair Circuit Court in having enticed away a slave the property of D. C. Hardin Esq -- The bail bond was for the sum of One Hundred Dollars -- </p>
<p>Your petitiooner was induced to beleive the woman Betsey Cowan was innocent of the charge against her -- He is satisfied no sufficient proof of guilt could have been brought against her on final trial from talking with attorneys who prosecuted and defended the said negro. He has made diligent efforts to have said negro brought to justice and trial, He is very old, not able to pay the amount of the fine without serious inconvenience, his home now being levied on by the Sheriff to satisfy the fine aforesaid -- therefore he prays that said fine &amp; forfeited recognisance be remitted -- </p>
<p>Reuben Malone</p>

<p>This petition is signed by both the attorneys who prosecuted &amp; defended in the case referred to, and also by P W Hardin the principal witness for the Com"th -- who is son to the Prosecutor and a practising Attorney -- </p>
<p>I am satisfied it is a meritorious Case and if it suits the views of your Excellency to remit the fine it would gratify -- </p>
<p>Yours Truly
