   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>The Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your petitioner, Abner Mason, respectfully represents, that upon an Indictment, returned against him, in the City Court of Louisville, on the <date when="1860-10-30">30th day of October A.D. 1860,</date> a judgment was rendered upon a verdict on said indictment for a fine of $500<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi>, for gaming.</p>
<p>The part of said fine ($150<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi>) which belonged to the prosecuting attorney, and the costs of the court, your petitioner has long since paid; about the same time, he made application to the then Governor of Kentucky, for a remission of the balance of the fine.</p>
<p>Your petitioner, has, all along, until today, believed that the remission was granted; but on examination of the records, he has ascertained, that it was only a respite, and was granted on the <date when="1860-11-16">16th day of November, 1860</date>, as your Excellency will find by reference to the State Records.</p>
<p>Your petitioner states that on today, a <hi rend="underline">capias pro fieri</hi> has been sued out against him, for the matters of fine, aforesaid, and he is liable to arrest and confinement thereon, in the city Workhouse. Your petitioner therefore prays, in view of his limited means, his also having paid as above stated, and the further fact that he has unfortunately become crippled for life in the left arm, and besides having a large family dependent on him for support that Your Excellency will extend to him your Executive clemency and remit the Commonwealth's portion of the fine aforesaid, which has been respited only.</p>
<p>And, as in duty bound, your petitioner will ever pray &amp;c.</p>
<p>A. Mason.</p>

<p>To His Excellency, Gov Bramlette,</p>
<p>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir: At the time referred to in the foregoing petition of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Mason, I was the prosecuting attorney. The statement of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Mason that he paid my part of the fine &amp; the costs of the prosecution are true. I have also Examined the records here and find that a respite only and not a remission, was granted. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Mason is a cripple and in view of the fact and the others stated in the petition, as well as his having made the payments mentioned, I hope your Excellency may find it consistent with your feelings to Extend to him the Executive clemency prayed and <hi rend="underline">remit</hi> the portion of the fine coming to the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Very Truly, Yr obd't servant.

<p>To His Excellency Gov Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I was conversant with the facts of this case at the time, and state unhesitatingly that the prosecuter Powell in this case, done it through malice to Mason and also that the said Powell is notoriously a man of bad reputation. And I hope you will find it consistent with your duty to remit the above.</p>
<p>Very Truly Your
