   <p>Covington, <date when="1861-01-10">Jan 10. 1861</date>,
<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>B Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of Ky:</p>
<p>I have no acquaintance with Ferdinand Hack -- but have learned somewhat of him by enquiry and was present at the time of his trial. I am satisfied that he is not a malicious or dangerous person and that his habits are those of a hard working man. The gentlem<hi rend="str">a</hi>en on the Jury who tried him are among our best citizens, some of them being school Trustees in this city and all of them honorable high minded men: I<pb/>
<lb/>heartily Join with them in recommending Hack to your Official clemency, I am in no ways related to Hack and have no interest in recommending him, beyond the sense of satisfaction in seeing him dealt with as Justice tempered with mercy requires. Did I not believe that it would be proper and beneficial to exert your power to pardon in his favor, I could not <hi rend="str">be</hi> allow myself to address a word in his favor. I know &amp; feel the necessity in this city of dealing severely with the rowdies that best us, but as I feel satis-<pb/>
<lb/>fied -- entirely satisfied that Hack can in no sense be numbered with that class, I respectfully Join in soliciting his pardon.</p>
<p>With great respect
<lb/>Yours Truly,
<lb/>John, P. Harrison</p>
<p>I concur in the statements of the foregoing letter_ and would further state that I assisted in the defense of the party, but from the peculiarity of the case the jury could not do otherwise than they did. They have however submited his petition &amp; I join with them asking your favor in his behalf -- </p>
<p>most truly
<lb/>Your obt. svt.
<lb/>G. Clay Smith</p>
