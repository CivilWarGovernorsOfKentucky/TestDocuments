<p>Your Petitioner Robt W Lowery senior would state that at the <date when="1859-07">July Term 1859</date> ^of Mercer Circuit Court^ he was by a Jury found guilty of the offense of Keeping a Tippling House &amp; Judgment rendered against him for sixty dollars &amp; costs. He states that he opened a Tavern in the Town of Harrodsburg and in said Tavern House sold spiritous liquors, before he obtained license to keep Tavern. He sold &amp; permitted the spiritous liquors to be sold under the belief &amp; impression that he had a right to do so &amp; that the obtention of license at the next regular court would cover this previous selling_ That he did obtain the License to keep a Tavern in the same home &amp; at the same place when the ardent spirits were sold from the proper court. that in the previous he acted innocently &amp; ignorantly, had no intention a such to evade the Law, &amp; am only what he believe he had the right to do &amp; obtain &amp; paid ^for^ the License under the belief that he was thereby complying with the Law. Wherefor he prays that the fine be remitted.</p>
