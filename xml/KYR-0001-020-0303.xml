<p>Your petitioner Jacob Neace respectfully represent to your excellency, that at the <gap/> Term of the Breathitt Circuit Court, he was Indicted for malicious stabbing and at the <date when="1859-10">October term of said Court 1859</date>, was tried upon said indictment, and the Jury found him guilty of stabbing in sudden heat of passion, and fined him Fifty Dollars and imprisoned him six-months in the county jail of Breathitt county. Your petitioner further represent to your excellency, that he is a very poor man, and has a large family to support and his only method of obtaining that support is by daily labor; and if compelled to lay in jail six months and pay said fifty Dollars, his wife and little children will undoubtedly suffer; He further represents that at the time he stabbed Nathan Fugate, there were a great many persons throwing rocks at your petitioner, said Fugate being one of the number, several of the rocks hit him on the head and face, before he stabbed said Fugate, and he only stabbed him in necessary self defense. Wherefore he prays your Excellency to remit said fine and imprisonment</p>
<p>Jacob Neace.</p>
<p>We the undersigned join in the above petitioen, and recommend Jacab Neace as a fit subject of the Executive clemency.<figure type="hr"/></p>
