<p>Robert P Steenbergen being duly sworn deposes and says that there is a judgment against him ^for $45.00^ and also a judgment against Benjamin F. Steenbergen ^for $40.00^ in the Washington Circuit Court on an indictment for selling whiskey to a slave,. that said whiskey was legally and properly sold as said Steenbergen believed, said slave having what purported to be an order from his master but which order the owner of the slave denied giving on the trial that the prosecution was prompted by a bad state of feeling existing in the neighborhood on the part of those who carried on the same which arose from some very angry litigation that had been conducted in the shape of two slander suits &amp; a prosecution for enfanticide &amp;c with said Steenbergens on one side and the persons who conducted said prosecution against them for selling whiskey &amp;c on the other. -- </p>
<p>Wherefore he would respectfully ask that said fines be remitted</p>
