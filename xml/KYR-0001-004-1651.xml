<lb/>To Gov. Bramlett.
<lb/>Dr. Sir.</p>
<p>At the instance of our Clients Joseph Short &amp; John Harding. we write you on the subject of Executive interposition in their favour -- we may be biased in their favour owing to our employment, as we know &amp; so do you that Counsel sometimes are, We feel however no hesitancy in saying to you that we have satisfactory reasons for the belief that; our clients did not design to Rob. or steal. we think it probable that under the influence of drink, they may have and likely did abuse the authority given them by the Military to arrest suspected persons: but in this<pb/>
<lb/>they are liable to an action by the prosecutor, we have little doubt one year ago had we been able to try the case they would have been cleared &amp; but a combination of circumstances was brought to bear at the trial, that we were unable to resist -- This sir is our view of the case and impartial we think we have satisfactory evidence of the actions of others tending much more strongly to implicate them criminally than the evidence in this case does these parties, and they have been praised by individuals &amp; the public -- &amp; these men are to be made <hi rend="underline">examples</hi> of -- </p>
<p>we think the question is was the act done with an intent to Rob or steal. -- only in that event ought they to be convicted or even tried -- the evidence did not convince us that they were guilty -- we have known<pb/>
<lb/>them a number of years, or rather Short -- Hardin since he grew up -- we knew his Father &amp; grand Father, they have been regarded as highly reputable, never heard aught against them until this affair:</p>
<p>we hope sir you may deem the case of that character to admit of executive Clemency, &amp; that you will give them the aid prayed for.</p>
<p>we are sorry to trouble you with so large a statement, but could not say less, in truth -- </p>
<p>truly yours -- 
<lb/>Rountree &amp; Fogle<pb/></p>
<p>To Gov. Bramlett.
<lb/>Frankfort.
<lb/>Ky</p>
