<lb/>To his Excellency Governor Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort Ky.
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>Permit me to introduce to your notice Edward Baker a most brave &amp; gallant Soldier formerly a member of my Regt. who was seriously and permanently injured for life while Serving in the army, being wounded no less than five times, Your Excellency will see from Mr Baker's papers that there have been several indictments found against him for keeping what is termed a Jenny Lind Table, and allowing minors to play upon it, of which the said Baker pleads innocent of, and from my accquaintance and personal Knowledge of the character of said Baker, I am satisfied he is not guilty as charged in the indictments
<lb/>over<pb/></p>
<p>I therefore earnestly recommend said Baker to your Excellency's consideration for executive clemency, he not being able to defend the suits, having lost all his money &amp; property last December by Gen Lyon's raid. I have the honor to subscribe myself your Excellency's</p>
<p>Obedt Servt
