   <p>Louisville Ky <date when="1861-08-30">Aug -- 30 -- 1861</date>
<lb/>His Excellency. B Magoffin,</p>
<p>I learn that a petition for the pardon of W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> A Huff -- (now confined in the state prison) for larceny has been presented to your Excellency, and that the petition does not state any of the proof in the case, and I am requested by the Mother of Huff to write you a statement of the case, Myself and G W. Hite were the attorneys for Huff and also Stephens who was arrested with Huff -- they were both Very young at the time and indicted charged with stealing Jewelry from the store of John Doran in the City of Louisville, the proof according to my recollection was about this -- Dorans Store was Entered in the night and a quantity of Jewelry Stolen, the Jewelry was subsequently found upon the lot of Huffs father in Louisville burried in a box, Suspicion rested upon Stephens &amp; Huff. they were both arrested, they had been Very intimate associates, Huff denied his guilt while Stephens Confessed his, and Denied that Huff knew anything about the matter or had any thing to do with the larceny, I was Satisfied upon the trial that the proof did not Warrant the conviction of Huff -- and I am yet of the Same opinion, I thought this and think yet, that the Jury convicted Huff -- more upon the ground of his having been an -- associate of Stephens than from any prooff agaisnt Huff -- the lot where the jewelry was hid was just as accessable to Stephens as Huff, and I believe that Huffs is a case that will Warrant your Excellency in granting him a pardon</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>W C. Price<pb/></p>
<p>P. S.</p>
<p>G W. Hite is absent from the city or he would unite with me in the above statement I think, for we have talked the matter over frequently and agreed in our statement of the case and that the proof did not Warrant the Conviction of Huff -- </p>
<p>Price</p>
