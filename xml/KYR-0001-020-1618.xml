   <p>Honorable B. Magoffin
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>The Petitioner, Jeff Brown would respectfully petition and represent unto your Excellency that on the <date when="1861-09-07">7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of Sept 1861</date> he was induced by James G. Gorsuch, a Captain of Company in the State Guard, who had been arrested upon a charge in the City Court of Louisville for misapplying state arms, to go upon his recognizance ^of $800.00^ with four others Viz. A. P. Gorsuch his father, H. F. Simerall, Judge John Joyes and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> L. B. Bates, for his appearance at the next term of the Jefferson Circuit Court. The said Captain Gorsuch represented that he was at Camp near Elizabethtown, with his company drilling for instruction in military tactics, as he had a night under military law and regulations, as petitioner was informed by officers in the State Guard higher in rank than Captain He was further induced to do this, as it was represented to him that the other sureties were large property holders, with the exception of one only, and he in good circumstances, and that no risk would be incurred, but merely<pb/>
<lb/>desire his name to give the defense a character in way of numbers.</p>
<p>Since that time, the State of Kentucky has become deeply involved in the present revolution, and said Gorsuch failed to make his appearance at the last Circuit court, and the recognizance forfeited. Your petition is now summoned to <unclear>answer</unclear> &amp; pay the forfeiture.</p>
<p>He will represent that the said Simerall, Joyes and Bates, the responsible sureties to said bail are now absent from the Commonwealth, or without the power of the process of this court, and your petition will be compelled to pay the judgment (which soon will be obtained) unless interposed by Executive clemency. Your petition states that he is a poor man, and no available means to pay ^with^ under the present pressure of the times -- that he has had a sick family for the last year, taking him much away from business, and costing him much money. He states that it will be a ruinous hardship upon him to be compelled to meet the consequences of the pending action He prays a release from the same.</p>
