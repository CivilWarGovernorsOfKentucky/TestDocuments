   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor &amp;c</p>
<p>At the present session of the Circuit Court for Fayette County Robert Haydon a colored man was convicted of Grand Larceny and sentenced to one years imprisonment in the Penitentiary.</p>
<p>The proof was that a Ham weighing some 25 lbs was stolen: a ham was found in his possession, which was identified &amp; the satisfaction of the Jury as the stolen ham <unclear/> <unclear/>tification was hardly <unclear/> <unclear/> The specie value of the stolen <unclear/> was prov<unclear/> to be about $4.16 first barely making <unclear/> crime grand Larceny. This negro has been in Jail already <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> over two months and a half. His family need his services: his previous character has been good: his punishment has been already ample and we respectfully represent that the case presents a proper one for Executive clemency. While it is true that the law ought not to be broken with impunity by negroes, it is equally true that no greater severity of punishment ought to be inflicted upon these poor ignorant creatures than upon white offeners.<pb/>
