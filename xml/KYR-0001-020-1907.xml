   <p>To His Excellency Governor M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin </p>
<p>Your petitioner Thomas Dunn would represent that he was fined at the late term of the Pendleton Circuit Court <date when="1862-04">April the <gap/> 1862</date> the sum of $25 for standing a stud horse without license. He states that he had forgotten when the term of the Court commenced and did not attend. If he had attended no fine would have been imposed upon him. He was the owner of a stud horse "Bill" and farmed him to one John S Merrill who paid the sum of $5 and took out license to stand said horse. He stood the horse at different points a part of the time at the house of Petitioner Hence he was indicted as he supposes. After the season was out petitioner traded the horse off. He herewith files as a part of this petition the licence to stand said horse. He prays your Excellency to remit said fine. </p>
