   <p>Franklin Ky <date when="1865-09-23">23 Septr 1865</date>,
<lb/>Gov Bramlette,</p>
<p>Judgment has been rendered in the Allen Circuit Court against John H Decker of Monroe County as the bail of W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Decker for $500.. I learn that John H Decker will Shortly. forward you a petition for the remission of the Judgt. to the extent or your power.</p>
<p>I promised him that I would state his standing &amp; reputation in his Community. I have known John H Decker for Several years. He is an exceedingly honorable and clever gentleman, and is a poor man. His son W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Decker, is about grown and with the exception of the Single offense for which he was Indicted, his reputation is good.</p>
<p>I learn from a reliable Source, that the offense for which he was Indicted was Committed under the following Circumstances. He had started to Join the federal army and at Jimtown in Monroe County fell in with two other men (who proved to be thieves) who induced him to drink to intoxication, and while in that condition the three left together and in a little while they Committed the theft. The persons whose property was stolen and<pb/>
<lb/>those residing in that neighborhood attach very little blame to young Decker. H did Join the Federal army for a year made a good Soldier, and at the close of this time of Service was honorably discharged. I regard the case as one Justifying executive clemency</p>
<p>Your friend
