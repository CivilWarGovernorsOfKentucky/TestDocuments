   <p>The Undersigned Citizens of Lexington represent to the Governor of Kentucky that Frank Tankersley has been fined in the Lexington City Court in <date when="--02">February</date>, $50. &amp; costs for carrying a concealed weapon, and was on the <date when="--03-07">7" day of March</date> committed to the work house. He is a poor young man, not yet of age, with no friends or relations who have any means to pay the fine; &amp; unless relieved by Your Excellency he will be kept in the work house several months. He has no father or mother, &amp; an only sister ^about 18 years old^ who has no depdendence but him, her other brothers being in the Union Army.</p>
<p>The youthfulness of Tankersley &amp; the dependence of his young sister on him appeal strongly to the clemency of Your Excellency.</p>
<p>We respectfully request that his fine may be remitted -- </p>
