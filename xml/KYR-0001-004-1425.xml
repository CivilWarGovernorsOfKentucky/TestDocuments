   <p>To the Hon Thomas E Bramlette Governor of Ky</p>
<p>The petition of W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> O Chalfont of Dover Mason County Ky who states that for the past two years he has been the keeper of a retail grocery in said town and for the year terminating in the <date when="1864-11-07">7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of November 1864</date> he was regularly licensed to retail spiritous liquors ^(as a coffee house keeper)^ in any quantity he chose</p>
<p>He states that during said time he was engaged in retailing spiritous liquors he endeavored to meet all the requirements of the law, and in no instance violated it willfully -- In one or two instances however young ment under 21 years of age and whose appearance and conduct and associations indicated them to be men of full maturity, drank liquor at his bar and paid for the same, and this petitioner had no knowledge that he had violated the law by selling to <hi rend="underline">minors</hi> until at the <date when="1864-04">last April</date> Term of the Mason Circuit Court he was indicted therefor by the grand jury of the county and at the <date when="1864-10">october Term</date> of said court a fine was adjudged against him of <hi rend="underline">fifty</hi> <hi rend="underline">dollars</hi></p>
<p>He states that when he sold said <hi rend="underline">minors</hi> his liquors he believed them to be of full age and that he was justified in that belief by their appearance and general conduct and that in no instance did he intentionally violate the law in said cases</p>
<p>He believes therefore that as he committed said offence ignorantly and unintentionally that the <hi rend="underline">spirit</hi> of the law was not violated by him and he therefore prays the Governor of Ky to remit said fine</p>
<p>Wm O. Chalfont</p>
<p>State of Kentucky Mason County</p>
<p>Sworn to and subscribed by W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> O. Chalfont<pb/></p>
<p>before me a justice of the peace for said county this <date when="1865-01-23">23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> day of January 1865</date></p>
<p>Tho A Curran J P M C</p>
<p>To his Excelency the governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Dover Mason County Ky and vicinity respectfully join with W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> O Chalfont in his petition to your Excellency to have the fine remitted which was imposed upon him at the <date when="1864-10">last October</date> Term of the Mason Circuit Court -- because we believe he did not <hi rend="underline">intentionally</hi> violate the law, and was ignorant of the fact, that young men to whom he sold liquor were <hi rend="underline">minors</hi></p>
