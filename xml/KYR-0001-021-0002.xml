<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>The Governor of the State
<lb/>of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>A short time since I sent you a requisition from the Governor of the State of Louisiana, for the arrest of one Rebecca Langley and Elizabeth Benoit as <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>fugitives from justice from the parish of Orleans, supposing them at that time to be within your jurisdiction but before they could be arrested they had fled from the state of Kentucky, and are now in the state of Alabama, but they are travelling from state to state and as my authority ends in your state. I should feel obliged if you return me the requisition or afadavi<hi rend="str">d</hi>ts on file in your office so that I may obtain a requisition from the Governor of Louisiana upon this or any other state in which the said persons may<pb/>
<lb/>be found. Please forward as soon as possible from Adams Express to Memphis Tenn in care of J. Hencage Carter</p>
<p>I remain
<lb/>Your excellency's
<lb/>Obedient sevt
<lb/>J. A. Lattin</p>
