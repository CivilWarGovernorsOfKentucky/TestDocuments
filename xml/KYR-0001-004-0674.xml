   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your Petitioners respectfully represent that on the <gap/> day of <date when="1864-03">March 1864</date> the Kenton Circuit Court, sitting in Covington, imposed a fine upon them of Two Hundred dollars <hi rend="underline">each</hi> and costs. The indictment upon which they were tried charged them with allowing gaming in their house in said City and the evidence consisted entirely in the testimony of one witness who stated that he had several times played cards in the house of the Petitioners for money. Upon Cross Examination, he said that he had been instructed by one of the Defendants that he must not play for money or anything else and that he did not know that either of the Defendants ever knew of his gambling in the house. In as much as the Statutes declare that the mere proof that gambling was carried on is sufficient evidence that the occupants of a house knew of it unless the contrary be <hi rend="underline">clearly proved</hi>, the Jury felt themselves bound to find against your Petitioners. Your Petitioners at the time spoken of by the witness were keepers of a coffee House in Covington for which they<pb/>
<lb/>had the proper County and City Licenses, but since have abandoned the business and gone to other employments. They are men of but small means and make a livelihood by their own industry in various lawful occupations such as from time to time fall within their reach. The proportion of the fine that enures to the Commonwealth's Attorney is about sixty dollars from each of one hundred and twenty dollars <hi rend="str">from both beside the</hi> which with the Costs in the case make a very heavy sum for them to pay and they respectfully petition that the remain of said fine be released and that they may be pardoned of the same. And this they will ever pray.</p>
<p>G. W. Jones
<lb/>W. <unclear/> Hays
<lb/>Attest John P. Harrison</p>
<p>The statement of the testimony in the above petition is correctly stated and the facts as to the means &amp; condition of the petition are as stated and the costs are as much as they can pay without distressing them</p>
