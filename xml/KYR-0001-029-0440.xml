   <p>To his Excelency the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. -- </p>
<p>Your petitioner J H. Cayce will state that at the Dec<hi rend="underline">r</hi> Term of the Fulton Circuit Court ^from <date when="1861">1861</date>^ he was fined the sum of sixty dollars upon a charge for keeping a Tipling house, in Fulton County, He states that prior to the finding of the indictment against him he obtained a License from the County Court of Fulton County Ky to keep a Tavern at Caye's Station in said County which tavern he kept &amp; his Grocery or bar room he kept in a house a short distance from his Tavern house, believing at the time that it was no violation of law but for this he was evicted, &amp; find, </p>
<p>He states that it seemed to be the impression of some attornies with whom he advised &amp; they so instructed him that it was no violation of law &amp; in fact the Commonwlth attorney who was then acting gave him the same opinion -- And when he was indicted he went to Hickman to make his defence &amp; the attorney who was then acting Col Corbit advised him not to make any defense, as judgment would have to go against him in any way &amp; that the facts presented to the Governor he had no doubt the fine would be remitted, He states that he some time since prepair &amp; sent on a petition, together with the letter of Col Corbit, but has as yet received no answser -- Wherefore he asks for remission of said fine,</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">J H</hi>, Cayes<pb/></p>
<p>We whose names are hereto annexed respectfully request the Governor to remit the fine of M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Cayce, we have no doubt he acted in Good faith &amp; did not intend to violate the law. He is a man of limited means, Has a large family &amp; recently he &amp; his wife were seriously wounded in Columbus Ky, at their tavern by a deranged man, from which he has not yet recovered &amp; probably will never entirely recover,</p>
