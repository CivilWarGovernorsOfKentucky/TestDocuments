<lb/>Dr. Governor,</p>
<p>At the <date when="1862-11">Nov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Term 1862</date> of the Casey Circuit Court,- a Judgment was rendered ag<hi rend="sup">st</hi> him him for $25=00. besides costs &amp; for Standing a Stud horse, without haveing first taken out a License.</p>
<p>I am well Satisfied that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Rice had no stud horse, at the time though a man had left a Stud horse at his house &amp; he did let him to some <hi rend="str">Mar</hi> 2 or 3 mare merely to accommodate the neighbours. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Rice tells me (&amp; I am well satisfied that such is the case) the he did not know that there was any Indictment against him or he would have attended to it. The country was in great confusion about that time the Rebbles haveing taken the only negro boy he had &amp; some other property he was so much excited interrupted that if the Shff served process on him he has no recollection of it. Now M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Rice is a hard working man has a large &amp; helpless family &amp; no help If consistant with your feeling to remit the fine &amp; cost you will confer a great favour on M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Rice &amp; family. I think it would be an act of Justice to Mr Rice &amp; would meet the approbation of the neighbours &amp; county. I am well acquainted with Mr. Rice<pb/>
<lb/>&amp; family and as an act of Justice &amp; kindness would respectfully Solicit your Excellency to remit the Judment &amp; cost.</p>
<p>Your friend truly
<lb/>Addison Williams</p>
<p>Encose the Remission to me or W J Rice</p>
