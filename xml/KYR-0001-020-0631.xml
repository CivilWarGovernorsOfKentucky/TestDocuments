<lb/>Warren Kentucky
<lb/>His Excelency B Magoffin
<lb/>Frankfort Ky
<lb/>Dr Sir.</p>
<p>This will be handed you by one of my old-Long-tried and Special friends Mr S A Gossom of this County. Who visits your City for the Purpose of <hi rend="underline">appealing</hi> to your <hi rend="underline">Clemency</hi> in behalf of his Nephew Rufus Jones lately Sent from this county to the State-Prison for killing Jenkins.</p>
<p>There Seems to be but one opinion So-far as I know or have herd, and that is, that the young-man who was killed and Jones were raised in the same Neighborhood and had always been Friends, that previous -- Malice, had not previously existed, and but for the accomplice (who was previously cleared) and other associations at the time unfortunate, the difficulty would not have happened. There were three Famillys, influential &amp; numerouse, <hi rend="underline">immediately</hi> connected in their associations and otherwise, whose Peace &amp; happiness have been greatly Afflicted from the result of this affair, and while the Young Man whose Untimely -- death was the result was my <hi rend="underline">Kinsman</hi> by blood, yet I do not believe that the continuance of Jones <hi rend="underline">in</hi> <hi rend="underline">prison</hi> will additionally-attone for the Crime committed, that the atonement ^Sympathy^ of all the Parties concerned, have been Mutual &amp; Reciprocal in a great digree, and of the Executive-Clemency and Pardon could consistantly be extended, it would perhaps, Save the young-man which now <hi rend="underline">under</hi> the circumstances is the <hi rend="underline">thing</hi> <hi rend="underline">most</hi> to be desired. At the Special Instance of my friend S A Gossom. I address you this note, hoping that Such action on your part as maybe consistant with your official duty &amp; the excercise of mercy be observed.</p>
<p>With great respect your friend.
<lb/>John Durnam</p>
