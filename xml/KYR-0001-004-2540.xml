   <p>Louisville <date when="1865-10-14">Oct 14. 1865</date>.
<lb/>Hon Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Gov. of Ky
<lb/>Governor</p>
<p>I have the honor to make the following statement of facts <hi rend="underline">Edward Saxon</hi> at one time soldeir in the Legion got drunk in this city; and possibily while laboring under mania a potu stole a pair of pants At the Examining trial which was held before Esquires Clement and Matlock Saxon was required to find bail in the sum of $<gap/> to answer.</p>
<p>At my urgent solicitation and at the solicitation of his comrads Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Rousseau who used to be his regimental commander offered himself as bail. It was impossible having been his Colonel, to refuse<pb/>
<lb/>him At the next term of the Jeff Circuit Court Saxon came forward and promptly stood ready to answer until the last evening of court when the pressure was too much he left, The Grand Jury refused to find an indictment against him</p>
<p>Under these circumstances I would respectfully request a remission of the entire bail, before Judgment. Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> R did only what every officer was bound to a do knowing that Saxon heretofore and while in the Army ^had^ borne a character unimpeached and unimpeachable</p>
<p>I was attorney for Saxon and can certify to the truth of facts stated</p>
<p>Resply
<lb/>Selby Harney</p>
<p>I have appled to Messrs C &amp; M to sign this<pb/>
<lb/>I join in the foregoing petition</p>
<p>Jo<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> Clement Justice of the peace Jeff Co Ky</p>
<p>I join in the request of the applicant</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Sam</hi><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> <hi rend="underline">Matlock</hi> J. P. J. C</p>
<p>I think it would be a proper Exercise of Executive Clemency to release a Surety where the Grand Jury refuse to find an Indictment against the principal -- His presence in court is not Necessary to the ends of Justice</p>
<p>Geo W Johnston.
<lb/>(Judge Jf<hi rend="sup">n</hi> Ct Court)</p>
<p>I heard the testimony before the examining court and join in the request of the applicant</p>
<p>E. W. Rutledge C, J, C.</p>
<p>When I became bail as stated above I believe young Saxon innocent &amp; do not doubt his innocence now of the <hi rend="underline">crime</hi> of theft whatever may have been his <hi rend="underline">acts</hi> -- </p>
<p>But at any rate he<pb/>
<lb/>was not indicted &amp; it would seem a little hard as well as unjust to have the bail bond enforced -- The Justices &amp; the constable who <unclear/> in the examining trial, Join in this petition to remit -- I hope the Governor may think it proper to grant the petition &amp; remit the forfeiture</p>
<p>very Respectfully &amp;c
<lb/>Lovell H Rousseau</p>
<p>Jefferson Cir Ct
