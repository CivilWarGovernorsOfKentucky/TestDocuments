<lb/>Hon. Beriah Magoffin.
<lb/>Gov. of Kentucky.
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Preston Troutman was fined at our last court the sum of three hundred dollars. The fine is excessive. he is poor and has a family and is unable to pay it, he was not present at the trial as I am informed on account of the sickness of his wife; other dependants, who were present, were acquitted &amp; were more concerned in the transaction than Troutman as has come out since the trial; I respectfully request you to interpose in his behalf.</p>
<p>Your Respectfully
<lb/><hi rend="underline">W</hi><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> <hi rend="underline">B</hi> <hi rend="underline">Thompson</hi></p>
