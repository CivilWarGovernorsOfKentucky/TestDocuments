<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>B. Magoffin Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I take the liberty of troubling you about a small matter on behalf of a citizen of our County. small as it is however I can assure your Excellency it is a matter of some importance to this poor man.</p>
<p>A fine for a common breach of the peace was Some time since assessed before a Justice of the peace of Green County against <hi rend="underline">Fidella Warren</hi> of said County for &amp;15.00^cts^ and cost; the last amounting to more on about as much as the fine -- Two persons were taken up for the offense. Warren being one.. the real guilty party, (as I am told the fact was -- ). was released and by a combination between the prosecution &amp; this released Deft, the whole offence was saddled upon Warren &amp; he was accordingly fined, &amp; the guilty party let off Warren is a very poor man with a wife &amp; several little children they depend solely upon his labor to live. his friends have aided him in paying the cost <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>. The fine is still unpaid -- He petitioned your Excellency some time ago through D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> D P White for a release of the fine. &amp; I suppose the petition is now on file. I respectfully call your Excellencys attention to this case. I do this at the Earnest request of the wife and friends of this poor man. who are now in a helpess and very dependent Condition -- all they have if sold would not pay the fine and the consequence<pb/>
<lb/>will be that he will have to go to Jail and there, not only not pay the fine, but incur more Cost to the Commonwealth &amp; render more -- miserable &amp; wretched his already suffering family.</p>
<p>We humbly concur that it would be an act of charity &amp; humanity. (small as the fine is) to release this man from its payment for which your Excellency will receive the thanks and prayers of this poor but meritorious family.</p>
<p>I hope your Excellency will pardon me for this troubling you with as small a matter as this -- but the cause of suffering humanity is my plea &amp; apology</p>
<p>I have the honor to be
<lb/>very respectfully
<lb/>your obdt servt
