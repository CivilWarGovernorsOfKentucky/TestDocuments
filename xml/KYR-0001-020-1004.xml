   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your petitioner Sam<hi rend="sup">l</hi> O Berry respectfully represents that at the <date when="1859-02">Feby Term 1859</date> of the Fayette Circuit Court he was fined $250 on an indictment for a disorderly house -- He states that at the time said fine was rendered there was a strong prejudice against the keepers of groceries in the City of Lexington which induced juries upon presumption alone to render verdicts against all who were indicted. He is &amp; has always been a quiet &amp; orderly citizen &amp; denies that he ever suffered or permitted any noise or disorder of any kind about said store -- He has not been in the grocery business for some time, is in poor circumstances &amp; has not the means to pay said fine -- Unless remitted by your Excellency he must go to the jail of the county to satisfy the capias -- </p>
<p>He respectfully asks a remission of said fine -- </p>
<p>S,, O,, Berry<pb/></p>
<p>Knowing Sam<hi rend="sup">l</hi> O Berry to be a peacable -- quiet &amp; well behaved citizen, we recommend to his Excellency the Governor a remission of his fines &amp; unite with him in his petition</p>
