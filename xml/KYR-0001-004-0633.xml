<lb/>Governor Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed you will find a petition from the Jurors who tried the case of Andrew Hast for carrying concealed a <hi rend="underline">Pistol</hi>. Said Hast is a young man not more than 19 or 20 years of age, he drives an Omnibus, &amp; his home is some eight squares from the stable &amp; this distance he has to travel at night, &amp; for safety he carried the pistol for which he was fined. It is true that he was not driving an Omnibus the night the pistol was found on him. His Father is dead &amp; his mother has several small children who in a great measure are dependant upon the subject of this petition.</p>
<p>We unite in the prayer of the Jury &amp;c
<lb/>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Baird &amp; Price<pb/></p>
