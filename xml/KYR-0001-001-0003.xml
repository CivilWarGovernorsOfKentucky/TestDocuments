   <p>PROCLAMATION.
<lb/><figure type="seal"><ab>UNITED WE STAND DIVIDED WE FALL</ab></figure>
<lb/>Commonwealth of Kentucky,
<lb/>EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,
<lb/>Frankfort, <date when="1865-04-21">April 21, 1865.</date></p>
<p>In view of the sad calamity which has fallen upon our country by the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the President of the United States of America, it becomes us as a people to humble ourselves before a Merciful God, and pray Him that the sin of our people, which has culminated in such great crime, be forgiven, and we purged from our iniquity, and be again restored to His favor, and to peace and unity amongst ourselves.</p>
<p>For this purpose, Thursday, the <date when="1865-05-04">4th day of May, 1865,</date> is hereby appointed as a day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer.</p>
<p>On that day the people of Kentucky are invoked to suspend all secular business, and, at the usual hour for service, attend their respective places of worship, and engage in the solemn and earnest observance of the day as one for humiliation before God, and prayer for His forgiving mercy and sustaining grace, in this our day of afflication.</p>
<p>THOS. E. BRAMLETTE, Governor of Kentucky.</p>
