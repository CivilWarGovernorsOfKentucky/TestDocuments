   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>Your Petitioner F. C. Carr would most rescpecfully state unto your Excellency that at the <date when="1860-12">Dec Term 1860</date> an Indictment was found against Whit Henry in the Fulton Equity &amp; Criminal court for Gaming in the house of another without his Knowledge or consent, and Bail was fixed on said Indictment of $100, and a Bench Warrant issued on the same, and on the <date when="1861-03-28">28<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of March 1861</date> your Petitioner went upon a Bail Bond as the surety of said Henry for his appearance at the next <date when="--05">May Term</date> of said Court. At the said <date when="--05">May Term</date> nothing was done in the case and as we had no courts here after that till <date when="1863">1863</date> when the said Henry was tried and fined twenty dollars &amp; costs, and at the same term of the Court the said Bail Bond was forfeited, and at the <date when="1864-03">March Term 1864</date> of the Fulton Circuit Court after a summons having been served on your Petitioner a Judgment was rendered against your Petitioner for the sum of one Hundred dollars_</p>
<p>Now your Petitioner would state that that he is a young man, with a dependant family upon him for support, and at the time he signed said Bond, he never expected to incur any liability upon said Bond, the said Whit Henry was a young man born and raised in this county and was present at the <date when="1861-05">May Term 1861</date> of the Court<pb/>
<lb/>but when this Rebellion had broken out, he like many other young men went into the service of the so-called Confederate States army &amp; has remained there ever since, &amp; has left no property behind him out of which any part of said debt can be made_</p>
<p>Your Petitioner would state that he has ever been a worthy, loyal citizen of this Commonwealth and it will be a grevious hardship to his family to have said Judgment to pay, &amp; he respectfully asks your Excellency to remit the same_</p>
<p><date when="1864-03-28">March 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1864</date>
<lb/>F. C. Carr<pb/></p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Fulton County Ky. are acquainted with F. C. Carr the Petitioner and concur in stating it would be a just act of Executive clemency to remit the Judgment against him for our Hundred dollars of <date when="1864-03">March Term ^1864</date>^ of Fulton Circuit Court_</p>
