<lb/>To His Excellency Gov J, F, Robinson
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>Allow me to submit to your consideration, that on the <date when="1861-10-12">12<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> of Oct 1861</date>, I enlisted in Company, H, 16<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky Vol Infty, as private since which time I have made a faithful soldier and let my position be as it may, I expect to continue in the service until the close of the war.</p>
<p>But feeling satisfied that I could do more good for the cause as a Recruiting Officer, I write you for information as to how I should proceed to get a commission under the late call upon Ky for 20,000 volunteers.</p>
<p>At the time of my enlistment I was employed in the capacity of a Deputy Sheriff in Fleming County Ky, and had been for nearly 3 years, prior to which time was employed as Deputy Clerk in the county clerks office, in the same county, for three years, and had become well acquainted all over the county, and know if a commission was given me I could do good my Brother-inlaw is the Sheriff of my County and has considerable acquaintance throughout the adjoining counties, having been acting in this capacity for a number of years, and he would do all he could<pb/>
<lb/>for me. I am twenty-five years of age. My Parents are dead, and I have two Brothers in the same company to which I belong. </p>
<p>If recommendation is required I refer you to Judge S W Andrews, and Hon W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> S Botts, Legislator from Fleming County.</p>
<p>Your Truly
<lb/>John L. Dorsey<pb/></p>
