<lb/>To Mr John L Scott
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the instance of Mr Gothelf we enclose you some papers, relative to a petition to the Govenor signed by the Jurors who tried the case praying the Go<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">v</hi></hi> for the pardon of one Kaufman Kramer: It seems that the Governor declined at the instant because of having received a letter purporting to be from Chas L Stancliffe Chief of Police, of the City of Louisville from the representations in said Stancliffes letter, random statements were made: which if true Mr. Gothelf would feel mortified that he interposed and besought the pardon of this old man: but through your kindness He was enabled to get a copy of the aforesaid letter<pb/>
<lb/>and upon the exhibition of the letter to the Chief of Police: It turns out that it was written by a young man in Mr. Stancliffes office who gave what he had heard some one say about Kaufman Kremer: (possibly a vindictive Watch man:) Mr. Stancliffe upon examining into the matter ascertains that the rumors are not true &amp; withdraws the letter which was written to the Govenor: which said letter please find enclosed and by calling the attention of the Govnor ^to the same^ you will very much</p>
<p>oblige Yours 
<lb/>Craig &amp; Elliott</p>
  </body>
