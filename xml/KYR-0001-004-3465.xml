   <p>To His Excellency the Honerable Thomas E. Bramlett govenor of Ky. we the undersigned Citizens of Jackson County would Most Respectfully Represent to your Honer,, that at our <date when="--11">Last november term</date> of our Circuit Court that James Hellard was sentenced to the peniteniary for the term of one year Charce with <hi rend="str">the</hi> Larceny now we will say to your Honer that we do not Believe from the testimony that Hellard stole the Articles name in the Indictment But Believe that his wife did steal them they Being Bed Clothes and weareing clothes and one table cloth. the proof seemd to Be that James Hellard was som Eight Miles from Home the night that the goods was stolen and Returned Home the next Morning. when the owner of the goods were searching for them and non of them was found in his possession nor on his premises. But his wife had taken some of the Bed clothing one sheet and a table cloth to a neighbor woman and cut them up and got her to Make them up, and when the neighbor woman Braught them Home in a few days Hellard was at home and the owner of them was still Looking after them and found the Articles in the House of said Hellard and Him and His wife were Jointly indited and Hellart on this proof was convicted... Hellards wife was the oaldest daughter of one of our citizens who had a small Estate and her father had given her But Little and she Being a woman of small Intellect and of verry high predjudices and her father seemed to be giving of the Most of his Estate to his two younger children which Excited Hellards wife and cause her to commit the offence By takeing of her Brothers wifes property, and she not nowin as we think the penalty of the Law in such cases<pb/></p>
<p>Mr Hellard is a verry poore Man and has Left a Large family of small children at home and is in great need of his servises at home and is a Man of verry ordinary Intellect and has Ben Raise verry Ignorantly and hardly nows the prenalty of the Law in such cases</p>
<p>Now all of the primary conciderd we would Most Respectfully Ask your Honer to pardon said Hellard and Let him come home to his Little children</p>
