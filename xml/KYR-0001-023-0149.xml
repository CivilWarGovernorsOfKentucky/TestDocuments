<lb/>B. Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>It affords me pleasure to enclose you an editorial written by my friend -- an old Christian County Democrat -- Geo. C. Bronaugh, upholding the action of the Democratic Governor in opposition to that of a Democratic (?) Legislature.</p>
<p>It reflects the sentiments not only of nineteen twentieths of the Democracy, but also of a large portion of the <hi rend="str">De</hi>opposition.</p>
<p>I call your attention to it because I think it is about as able an article as I have seen &amp; further because it is written by an old acquaintance and friend with whom a few of us in this<pb/>
<lb/>county co-operated when there was something more in Democracy that the mere name, and when to be a Democrat <hi rend="str">in</hi>excluded a man from all hope of position; and not only so, but to some extent deprived him of even social intercourse with the Aristocracy of "Rags" -- Terrible wasnt it?</p>
<p>I am gratified to find your veto so universally endorsed</p>
<p>Very truly
<lb/>Yr friend
<lb/>Henry J. Stiles</p>
<p>Make Mayor Copy the article. The Register is published at Madisonville <hi rend="underline">Hopkins Co</hi> Ky -- </p>
