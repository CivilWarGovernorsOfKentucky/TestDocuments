   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thos. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Ann Murphy would respectfully represent that at the <date when="--03">March term</date> of the Lexington City Court she was tried for the offence of "Selling Liquor to slaves" and fined in the sum of Fifty Dollars; That she is poor, lone woman with an infant child dependant on her for support; That she has been in Kentucky only for a short time and that formerly she was a resident of Iowa and that she was not aware that under the laws of Kentucky it was prohibited to sell to negroes the same as to other persons and it was wholly in consequence of her ignorance in reference to this matter that she thus sold as above stated.</p>
<p>In view of these facts she would respectfully ask your Excellency to remit said fine except fees and costs and she will ever pray.</p>
