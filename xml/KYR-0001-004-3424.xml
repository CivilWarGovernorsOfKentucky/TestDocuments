   <p>To Hon Thomas E. Bramlet
<lb/>Govenor of the Coml<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> of Ky.</p>
<p>Your Petitioners represent to your Excellency that at the term of the Allen Equity &amp; Criminal Court <date when="1861">1861</date> there was a Judgement rendered agst one Dilingham Myze of this county for the sum of thirty five Dollars with costs from a charge of a Breech of the Pease We represent that we have known Mr Myze for several years and that he is a quiet good citizen and is not in the habit of getting into difficulties but is a very peaceable man We know that he ought not in Justice to himself &amp; family be required to pay the fine referred to. We believe the difficulty into which he was thrown was not induced upon his part. He is a very poor man &amp; has a large family with a widowed mother to support who has lost one son in the service of the U. S. &amp; has an other and only son except said Dillingham servd in the Union Army. Your Petitioners think that if there was ever a case that requires the interposition of the Executive clemency this is certainly one</p>
