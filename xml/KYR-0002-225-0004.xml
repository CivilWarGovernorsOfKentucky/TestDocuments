I with many Others think that we greatly Stand in need of arms to protect our homes. I have it from Reliable Source to day that men in the Country have Commissioned Robing. I have Know dout as to the truth of the case Some of the party is now under arrest. There is many circumstances that cause me to believe that we greatly Stand in need of arms I can make up a home guard Company of good sober Study Citizens. Now sir you being one of the board if we organize a home guard company according to the act of the Leg-<hi rend="str">islater</hi>islature We wish to know of you if we can get arms. It is thought by a good many that We cant get any I tell them that I think different This much I know that we will be copeled to pay our portion of taxes to pay for the State arms therefore we think that it is our right that We Should have our Cote of arms I understood to day that our Compnay in our County is like to get 44 stand. I wrote a few days ago to J, S C, Garrard for information about arms and have not Received any answer yet, You will please do me the favor to answer me by Return Mail and give me all the necessary information<pb/>
