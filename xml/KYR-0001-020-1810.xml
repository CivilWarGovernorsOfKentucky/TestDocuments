<lb/>Hon. B. Magoffin</p>
<p>Dear Sir. At the present Tirm of the Carter Circuit Court a Judgement was rendered in behalf of The Commonweath agast Robert. A. Horton. of Said County. and rendered alone against him for 500$ on one of the Secuitys of William K. Elliott Indicted for Felony. Elliott. Forfeited his bond last October from <hi rend="underline">no</hi> fear of the Conse quences of the prosecution, but because of the political diffences existing in the county. Mr Hortons four securties all left about the same time for the same reasons. and no Judgement can, or has been taken against them and There property<pb/>
<lb/>since they left has been taken by private creditors and thus the whole 500$ and cost is likely to fall on Mr Horton which is unust. and in these times and in a Section of the State, in which money is so difficult to obtain must ruin him. Now 150.$ and all costs he must pay and this will greatly oppress him. I. Trust your Excellency will pardon me when I urge you by all that is just and proper. to <hi rend="underline">remit</hi>. all of this Judgment, which under the Law. Executive Clemency will reach. and allow me to assure you will not only have benefited a <unclear/> friend of yours, but as a public Servant acted properly</p>
<p>your friend

<p>Governor McGoffin I hope you will find enough in the case of R A Horton to Justify your interference in his behalf the case is just W K Elliott. a brother of Johnathan Elliott. got into an unfortunate difficulty with his brother J<unclear>os</unclear> &amp; killed him was Indicted tried once &amp; Ten of the Jury for his acquittal; a year ago he was recognised in the sum of $500. with R A Horton &amp; four others as his securities last fall the <hi rend="underline">Home</hi> <hi rend="underline">Guard</hi> with a squad of Government troops succeeded in running out &amp; driving into the South not only Will K Elliott but also all co,securities; &amp; came near drawing Horton off. likewise at the <date when="1862-04">Apl Term 1862</date> (Just closed). a Judgment is given agt Horton for the $500. This amount would break up &amp; ruin Horton &amp; as the forfeiture was brought about by the action of the governement &amp; agents it would be cruel to break up &amp; ruin a worthy man that the government may pockett the $500 </p>
<p>I hope this plain statement of facts will enable you to come to a just conclusion</p>
<p>If you should remit please inclose it to me that I may get it to Horton safely there is no safety in the mail above here.</p>
<p>respectfully yr obt
