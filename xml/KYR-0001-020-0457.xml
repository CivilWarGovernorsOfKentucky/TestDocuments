   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of the State of Kentucky</p>
<p>At the present term of the Kenton Circuit Curt Ferdinand Hock was fined $50 and imprisoned for six months for the offense of maliciously cutting one Lawrence Miller with a barlow knife</p>
<p>The facts as proved are as follows:
<lb/>Hock was sititng in a bar room in Covington one night <date when="1860-11">last November</date>, when Miller came in, and began at once to quarrel with him, Miller then twice assaulted him, by violently seizing him, and by pushing him about, and forcing him twice into a sitting posture. It was proven, that after Hock had been a second time assaulted by Miller and pushed down, he arose drawing from his pocket a common Barlow Knife, with which he struck Miller on the face, and made a cut, not at all dangerous upon the face of Miller, all this was proven to have occurred consecutively and without any perceptible lapse of time,</p>
<p>These are all the facts proven in the case, and in view of<pb/>
<lb/>Hocks excellent character as a man of peace and good order of industry and intelligence we deem this a case eminently entitled to executive clemency, and release from <hi rend="str">at</hi> <hi rend="str">least</hi> the penalty of <hi rend="underline">imprisonment</hi> as now adjudged against him,</p>
