<p>Your petitioner further states that he is a member of the Home Guards at Winchester and did not feel safe without a weapon to defend himself against attacks from Southern men and sympathiser, and hence he carried a weapon, which was carried not with any intention of disreguarding the law but that he believed that the safety of his person demanded such a precaution Wherefore he prays to be discharged from his liability for said fine as far as in your power lies.</p>
