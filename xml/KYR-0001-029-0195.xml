<p>The Court then introduced Mary Franklin who stated that she went with her sister Elizabeth to the mill bottom as stated by her and Kennedy becoming rough &amp; violent in his manner she ran off &amp; Kennedy after her, who soon returned to where the sister was, but she very much alarmed ran home -- </p>

<p>The undersigned was the Attorney for the Com'th on the occasion of the trial of Kennedy &amp; White which resulted in their conviction for the Crime of Rape -- To the best of my recollection the above recital comprehends the substance of the testimony before the trial Jury</p>

<p>Patrick White Pettn for Pardon } Enclosure</p>
