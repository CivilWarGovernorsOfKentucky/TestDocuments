<lb/>Genl.. J. M. Harlan
<lb/>Dr Sir</p>
<p>By the request of B. S. Newton I write you some facts which I know in relation to his Son W<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. B. Newton who was indicted by the Grand Jury of our County, in <date when="1864-05">May 1864.</date></p>
<p>I was on the Grand Jury that indicted him, and the facts were of that description that it was necessary to find a true bill against him, but the Jury were Satisfied, that their intentions were not so much to Steal or rob. but they were in big drunken frolic and acted very imprudently and might have been punished. but not to the extent that a man ought who intended to steal &amp; rob. and Mr<pb/>
<lb/>B S Newton is little or wholly able to pay his Bail bond, indeed if he has to pay it, that together with his own debts will ruin him &amp; his helpless family,</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope you will do all you can to relieve him from the penalty of his bond.</p>
<p>Respectfully
