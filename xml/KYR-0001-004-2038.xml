<lb/>Montgomery County Ky. <date when="1865-08-29">August -- 29. 65</date>
<lb/>Liut. Col. Oliver A. Patton</p>
<p>Yours of the <date when="---27">27<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi></date> inst is before me,, as I desire to try &amp; do Something for you in your hard fate. I hasten to reply -- </p>
<p>I am Satisfied you belonged to the Confederate Army as early as the first year of the <hi rend="underline">war</hi>, that Brig. Genl. John S Williams did Send you to KY -- to recruit &amp;,,c -- &amp; understood you were once exchanged as a Captain -- then again taken a prisoner, &amp; I read in a Richmond paper the names, of Prisoners, Specially exchanged at Charleston, S. C -- &amp; your name was on the list of exchange as Lieut. Col. yourself &amp; others told me you were the Man, I also know you must have Suffered &amp; endured great trials &amp; hardships for the Cause of the South -- </p>
<p>Its true the Confederate States <unclear>were hard</unclear> <unclear/> for horses, to Mount the Cavalry &amp; officers were permitted by <hi rend="underline">authority</hi>, to press &amp; take horses to mount their <hi rend="underline">men</hi> as a matter of military <hi rend="underline">necessity</hi> those facts I am willing to give in a Deposition or Come in person to your Parole. It may be better or Safer to take my deposition, if needed, as I expect to go to Geo. on business in the later part of September &amp; may not return by your Court -- I truly regret to hear of your Suffering &amp; persecutions <unclear/> <hi rend="underline">poor</hi> <hi rend="underline">confeds</hi> have a hard time<pb/>
<lb/>I am not an exception, its true I am not indited for Horse Stealing, plenty of as good Soldiers as I ever could be are indicted in this Country -- I dont think it all will amount to much, only gratify the Spleen of a few radicals &amp; emancipated felons -- I am indited for treason in various forms &amp; Sued for Damage that would now amount to over $125,000 -- for the alledged Robbery of the Bank in Mt Sterling by Genl Morgans men -- I am not charged of having any hand in the Robery -- only was along &amp; they claim all, that was along are liable for the damage &amp;c -- they have my property attached &amp; taken from me, therefore I have no resources left me to Subsist upon I have to Sponge &amp; feed on <hi rend="underline">friends</hi> -- I feel anxious to get away from this Section -- We Cannot do any business here -- If we speak out or express our opinion, we are told we have no right to say a word, that we Rebels are held responsible for all the troubles in our County -- I asked <hi rend="underline">one</hi> the other day if he thought, the Negroes would been freed &amp; all this tyranny allowed, if Confederate Canon had triumphed &amp; gained of Independence but its no use to talk with Such beings -- </p>
<p>Yours truly
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> Johnson</p>
