<lb/>Gov. Bramblett:
<lb/>D Sir:</p>
<p>Inclosed find two Petitions for the remission of fines -- They are not numerously signed, but all who were applied to signed them, signatures to any given number might be obtained but it was deemed unnecessary,</p>
<p>One of them is signed by Eight of the Jury who rendered the verdict, The others of the Jury not being convenient to town were not applied to -- I am personally acquainted with the defendants Know their cases are meritorious, and am free to give the assurances that they will not again be indicted for a similar offense<pb/>
<lb/>They are quite poor and a remission of the fines will greatly relieve them</p>
<p>Trusting you may find yourself able to grant them the relief they ask, I am Gov.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>your Obt Sevt
