   <p>Bowling Green Ky <date when="1865-02-17">Feby 17/65</date>
<lb/>Dr J D Duncan</p>
<p>Sir -- thare has or will be a petition presented to Gov Bramlet asking him to release Francis Porter of allen county Ky of certain charges or indictments against him for robing stealing &amp;c the precise reading of the petition I cannot repeat -- </p>
<p>Porter was one of the worst scoundrels in this section of country he assisted in robing indiscriminiately and one accasion himself and others made a raid on scottsville robed the stores and fired on the Federal hospital which containd sevral sick and helpless soldiers one of them had been helped just outside of the doore he was murdered in cold blood -- I was in command of the post at scottsville at the time Porter was captured his <hi rend="str">only</hi> reason for his conduct was he was compelled to obey orders -- at the time of his capture he had with others in their passesian goods that they ha<hi rend="str">y</hi>d but a<pb/>
<lb/>few hours before stolen at rock hill Barren county Ky -- his cravat was <hi rend="str">off</hi> ^a piece of a^ silk dress stolen from the wife of one of the men of the 52 Ky vols the soldier recognized the silk as being a part of his wifes dress and charged Porter with haveing him badly which he did not deny -- If suck men as Porter are to be turnd loose I think soldiering had as well be put to an end</p>
<p>Respectfully yours &amp;c
<lb/>J. H Grider<pb/></p>
<p>Porter</p>
