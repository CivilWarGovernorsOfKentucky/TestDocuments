<lb/>Govr, Bramlett,</p>
<p>Dear Sir our court for the Spring Term here closed on yesterday, <hi rend="str">A</hi> a, Mr Calvin Dyer, was tried during the term, and found Guilty of having in his possession stolen property I sat by and heard the whole trial, the proof in my opinion was barely sufficient, to warrant the verdict of Guilty; upon the application for a new trial, there was disclosures made by affidavit, that I was of opinion would induce the court to grant a new trial, in this I was mistaken; taking the whole case of Dyer under consideration; I do believe it presents a fair case for executive clemency, I hope you will interpose in his behalf; very Respectfully</p>
<p>your Excellency's,
<lb/>obedient servant
<lb/>Ja<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. M. Rice</p>
