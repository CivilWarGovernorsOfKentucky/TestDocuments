   <p>To His Excellency,
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramlette
<lb/>Gov of Kentucky
<lb/>Honorable Sir</p>
<p>We the undersigned Jurors who convicted Patrick White under an inditement as accessory to the crime of Rape at the <date when="1862-02">February Term of the Campbell Circuit Court in the year 1862</date> in the City of Newport would respectfully represent, that said White was indited as accessory to the crime mentioned along with one William Kennedy as principal and that under the law as instructed by Judge Samuel Moor are were compelled to find them guilty and fix the term of years at twenty for each_that said White was in company with the said Kennedy at the time that said Kennedy committed the act mentioned in a Grove near this City- that said woman, who was of bad character or in other words a prostitute, and was outraged as appeared from the testimony by Kennedy only- that said White was never indited for any offense under our criminal law before. And in view of these facts we would respectfully but unguilty request Your Excellency to afford a pardon to the said White who has already served in the penitentiary of this State during the last two<pb/>
<lb/>years- We further represent that the prosecution <date when="1864-02-12"><hi rend="str">Feb 12</hi><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="str"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi></hi><hi rend="str"> 1864.</hi></date> Elizabeth Franklin stated on <hi rend="str">Newport Ky.</hi> the trial before us that Kennedy ^<hi rend="str">above</hi>^ had connection with her at the time of the alleged rape &amp; that White immediately thereafter had connection with: Whereas we are assured now by the evidence of the Mayor who held the examining Court &amp; other unimpeachable evidence that <hi rend="str">Kennedy above</hi> Elizabeth Franklin swore before the examining court that Kennedy alone had connection with her, having two connections within a very <hi rend="str">moment</hi> ^few^ minutes <hi rend="str">of</hi> of one another. Had we known at the time that we convicted White of this great discrepancy &amp; of the very bad chracter of the prosecution we could never have convicted White upon her testimony.</p>
<p>We think this case calls aloud for the clemency of the Executive &amp; Sincerely hope that White May be speedily released.</p>

<p>At the request of Senator Fisk I state that I was acting as Atty for the Com'th on the trial and Conviction of Peter White for the Crime of Rape</p>
<p>The prosecuting Witness was at the trial conspicuously pregnant.</p>
<p>Her Chracter as regarded Chasity was proven to be bad_ but as to veracity good.</p>
<p>I think Peter White, who has never served, (as I am informed) faithfully that ^(2)^ years of his time is a fit subject for Executive Clemency</p>
<p>Respt. &amp;c W E Arthur.</p>
<p>I am requested to add a word of explanation of one of the foregoing facts in my statement_to wit_The pregnancy apparent upon the trial was evidently, by a comparison of dates, not caused by the act for which White and his Co-Defendant were prosecuted</p>
