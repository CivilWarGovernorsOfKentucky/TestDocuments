   <p>Head-Quarters Military Agent,
<lb/>WESTERN DEPARTMENT.
<lb/>Louisville, Ky., <date when="1865-08-21">August 21<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> 1865</date>.
<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> E. Bramlette. Govorner.
<lb/>Frankfort. Ky..
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have the honor to respectfully ask, that you will write a letter to Major Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Palmer asking him, to, in so far as it is possible with the public to wit, commute the sentances of Kentucky men in Military Prisons in his Department, who have been guilty of no greater offence than desertion. That now that peace has returned to bless our land, "Justice' may give her seat to 'Mercy'. And to recommend to his consideration the cases of all Kentucky men, whom I may lay before him. I shall bring none but cases, which in my opinion deserve clemency. A letter of this kind inclosed to me from Your Excellency, will most undoubtedly have great weight, and will very greatly facilitate my labor<pb/>
<lb/>in procuring the release of these men, I have sixty nine men whose cases I am presenting for pardon. The assistance the letter I desire will be invaluable to me.</p>
<p>The men are very grateful for what I have done, and in advance, for what I hope to do for them.</p>
<p>Please reply at your earliest convenience</p>
<p>I am Very Respectfully, Sir,
<lb/>Your Obedient Servant,
<lb/>W DeB. Morrill
<lb/>Col,, and Mil. Agt Gen Kentucky,.<pb/></p>
<p>Mil</p>
