Hudson, which were replevied by Adam Rogers one for $66.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi> the other for $72.<hi rend="sup">55</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi> on the <date when="1863-09-28">28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> September 1863.</date> Hudson is insolvent and worthless -- Old Mr Rogers is about 83 years old, and has been weak in mind and body both for several years, wholly unfit for business, and besides has been almost ruined by this war, when the battle on the <date when="1862-08-30">30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> August 1862</date> was fought near this town, His house was used as hospital for our wounded Union soldiers for nearly two months -- He was forced to leave his home -- His servant had to cook, wash, &amp; wait on the sick and wounded in his house, being from 25 to 50 in number. His cattle were killed for beef, his grain consumed, &amp; his farm despoiled -- The Rebels carried off nearly all his horses, and now executions to pay the judgments af'd have been levied on his <unclear>tittle personally</unclear></p>
<p>You will confer a lasting obligation on him by remitting the amount of the two bonds aforesaid less<pb/>
<lb/>fees &amp; costs. &amp; you will be sustained in so doing, by all who know the facts -- please act in this petition at once &amp; favorably, &amp; we will ever pray.</p>
