<p>Sometime the first of last Summer Jessee McCormick was apprehended charged with the crime of Robery in forcing from one of our Citizens two Mules. The proof elicited in the Examining Court, was in Substance, that M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cormick belonged to the Rebel Army, and Just before the evacuation of this place (Bowling Green) by the Rebel Army M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cormick was sent out by his officer to press some Mules for said Army, In obedience to the order, he pressed two Mules &amp; carried them to the Army &amp; delivered them to said Army. The proof also showed that he took the Mules against the earnest protestations of the man from whom the Mules were taken. He M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Cormick <hi rend="str">the then</hi> asked the man from whom the Mules were taken, which Mules he prepared to spare (there being a number together) he told him that he had a choise if any were taken. McCormick took the two pointed out. The Court upon hearing the proof required McCormick to enter into a Bond of Four hundred Dollars for his appearance at the last <date when="--08">August</date> Term of the Warren Equity &amp; Criminal Court. The following persons were his securities on said Bond to wit William Halselby, James M. Halsell<pb/>

Jessee M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cormick failed to appear consequently his Bond was forfeited, at the last term of the Warren Equity &amp; Criminal Court, the Securities having no legal defense, they through me respectfully petition your Excellency if consistent with your sense of right to relieve them from the responsibilities resulting from the forfeiture aforesaid, I have had an interview with the Commonwealths Attorney of this district (W B Jones) who is cognizant of all the facts in the case who says that he will ^not^ throw any obstacles in the way of this petition, I send this in the care of my Friend the Hon J. R. Andrews and who is acquainted with all the parties, from whom you can get any information in reference to these petitioners that you may desire. They are all poor men except William Halsell who is a man in moderate circumstances, all except the last mentioned are hard pressed to pay their debts. They will receive it as a very great kindness if you willl relieve them, I have given the substance of the proof as I recollect it being present at the trial in the Examining Court being there the Attorney prosecuting</p>
