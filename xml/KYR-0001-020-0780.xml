   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>Gov. Magoffin</p>
<p>Jonathan Greer of this county was tried and convicted of manslaughter at the present term of our court and sentenced to five years imprisonment in the penitentiary.</p>
<p>I am informed by his lawyers and others in whose statements I have entire confidence that the killing was in defense of his, Greers, son, who was attempting to vindicate the character of his sister who had been slandered by the deceased. The facts are set out in a petition which will be presented to your Excellency and<pb/>
<lb/>which is signed by some of our best citizens who were cognizant of them. It is supposed that, if the facts of the case had been strictly admissible as evidence -- that is all that preceeded and pertained to the affair which resulted in the homicide, the verdict of the jury would have been an instant acquitted; and I am inclined to think that such would have been the result without any doubt. But many, indeed the most important circumstances attending it, were ruled out as inadmissible, and hence the convictions.</p>
<p>I have known M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Greer since my childhood. He has always borne a good character.<pb/>
<lb/>Has demeaned himself as a quiet law abiding and peacable citizens He is allied by marriage to one of the most numerous and respectable families of our county, and much solicitude is felt in behalf of his family. He has a wife and large family of children all dependent upon him for support. And from what I have heard, it was his desire to protect and guard the character of his daughters and the life of his son, that superinduced the difficulty which has resulted so unfortunately for him.</p>
<p>I feel confident that his case is one that merits the favorable consideration of your Excellency, and have no doubt whatever<pb/>
<lb/>that your interposition in his behalf would give satisfaction to his neighbors and our citizens generally.</p>
<p>Very truly &amp;
<lb/>Respflly
<lb/>Yr friend
<lb/>Henry J. Stites
