<lb/>His Exelency Gov Bramlette
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I have canvassed the county of Shelby for the purpose of raising a company of Mounted men to defend the county from the depredations of Guerrillas I have only Succeeded in recruiting eight men The citizens are very backward about turning out, I had an interview with Capt Hedden of Mt Eden He says he has some fifty men at his command I think if they were armed &amp; equiped they would be of immense benefit to the<pb/>
<lb/>county and State</p>
<p>This county now has Serveral Squads of Guerrillas and horse theives in it, a company of good men would soon releive the citizens of their fears <hi rend="str">S</hi> and Save them their property <hi rend="str">for them</hi></p>
<p>Any refference in regard to myself can be had by enquiring of Col Cochran ^at Shelbyville^ under whom I Served in the 2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> Ky Cav also Maj Harding Capt R H George under whom I have Served</p>
<p>This county needs a company of Mounted men in it badly There is no telling how much good they could accomplish under the command of vigilent officers<pb/></p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>yours

<p>To the Gov, and by him refered. Has tried to raise a company of mounted men for the defense of his county against raids -- has succeeded in raising only eight men. Had a conversation with Capt Hedden of Mount Eden. The Capt informed him that he had fifty men at his command. Thinks if these men were armed and equiped they would be a great benefit to the county &amp; state Are several Grla bands in his county -- Refers to several persons in regard to his character -- <figure type="hr"/></p>
