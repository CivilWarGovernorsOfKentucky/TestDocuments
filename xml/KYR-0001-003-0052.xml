   <p>State of Indiana,
<lb/>EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,
<lb/>INDIANAPOLIS, IND.<hi rend="italic"> </hi><date when="1864-01-14"><hi rend="italic">Jan</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1864</date>.
<lb/>To the People of Indiana:</p>
<p>The quota of Indiana, under the last call of the Presidnet for three hundred thousand men, was about nineteen thousand. This number was reduced by credit to 16,141, on the <date when="--10-20">20th day of October</date>, when the President's call appeared. The returns are not in, so that the exact numbers can not be given, but it is safely estimated that between thirteen and fourteen thousand men have been recruited in the State for the old and new regiments since the last mentioned date. This leaves a balance against the State of between two and three thousand men, which is undoubtedly covered by the re-enlistments of veteran Indiana troops in the field. By express order of the War Department the re-enlisted veterans are to be credited upon the quotas of the several States to which they belong.</p>
<p>The re-enlistment of the veterans in the field has far exceeded the most sanguine expectations of the Government, and thousands have volunteered for a second term where perhaps but hundreds were expected. This result is of the most gratifying and auspicious character, but it requires no argument to prove that if the re-enlisted veterans are largely counted upon the quotas of the several States, that the Government will come far short of getting three hundred thousand additional men called for by the President, and necessary for military operations during the next spring and summer. In this way another call by the President may become necessary, and in order to avoid the renewed liability of the State, and to render to the Government that full and complete support which is due from the State, I earnestly exhort the people of the various counties and townships yet in arrears, to make all necessary exertions to furnish the number of volunteers required of them, under the apportionment of the quota heretofore published. To do this will be the only security against a future draft. I trust the various recruiting officers, county and township authorities and military committees will not relax in their exertions until the quota of the State has been completely filled by the enlistment of men within the State. It is much easier to do this now that at any future time, and the efficient support rendered to the Government, and the example set before the nation, will be of the most salutary character.</p>
<p>O. P. MORTON,
<lb/>Governor of Indiana.</p>
