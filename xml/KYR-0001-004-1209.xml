   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>the Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>At the <date when="1864-08">August Term of the Boyle Circuit Court, 1864,</date> the Undersigned was indicted in 2 cases for unlawful gaming, and in each case a fine of $20 was inflicted by the Court</p>
<p>The undersigned represents that he is not a gamester by profession; indeed he seldom engages in play. And on the occasions, for which he is fined, he was ^not^ gameing for money, but for refreshment merely, and neither by himself, as those engaged hath been, was it thought they were violating any Statute. He regrets it, and promises your Excellency not again to have occasion to appeal to you for executive clemency,</p>
<p>He therefore respectfully asks for a remission of said fines</p>
<p>Danville. <date when="1864-09-24">Sept 24' 1864</date></p>

<p>The Undersigned Citizens of Danville unite in the prayer of this petition<pb/></p>
