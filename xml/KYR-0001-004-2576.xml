   <p>To all whom it may concern.</p>
<p>The Subscribers would, represent that whereas they understand that there is pending in the Calloway Circuit Court a prosecution for robbery against Joseph Miller, charging him with taking guns and pistols, the property of R. B. Rose, and whereas we are Satisfied from competent information that Said Miller was not near the house when the alledge robbery was committed at Said Rose's and was not in any body connected with it, or party thereto, but was following the party who actually took Said property, in order to get a mule of his which they had impressed to ride and that Said Miller has been a Law abiding man, innocent of that and all other crimes and although 53 years of age he has Stood up in defense of his Country as a home guard and afterwards Joined the Regular U. S. Army and faithfully Served his time out that, and now finally Since these things are true, and Said Miller has thus retained a good name unscathed or tarnished throughout a Long life. Save by Said prosecution. We believe that justice to him, to ourselves and the welfare of the country, demand not only that he Should be honorably aquited of Said charge, but that Said prosecution Should be dismissed as groundless, and unjust to the reputation of himself and family. And we would State<pb/>
<lb/>that this is not intended to reflect upon the grand jury, who found the bill as will appear by there having fuller information Signed this instrument, but it is one purpose to Say these facts before Our Commonwealths Attorney that he may if he in his discretion think best by and with the consent of the court grant our Said request, of the Grand Jury</p>
