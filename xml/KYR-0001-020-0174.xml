<p>Your petitioner, Wm Goodlow, would respectfully state that at the <date when="1860-11">Nov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Term 1860</date> of the City Court of Louisville, he was fined fifty dollars on an indictment for carrying concealed a pistol -- He states that he is a young man &amp; never has been in the habit of Carrying any weapon &amp; it was purely accidental that he had this weapon about him</p>
<p>It was not his purpose to carry a concealed weapon -- He was in Company with three or four of his Young friends at the Commercial Hotel, (where y<hi rend="sup">r</hi> petitioner had been boarding) &amp; where he was well acquainted -- at the time, the pistol, which belonged to the Hotel, was laying on a table, &amp; the young friends &amp; petitioner were playing innocently together, when your petitioner slipped the pistol into his pocket to play off a joke; &amp; when he afterwards left the Hotel, he forgot all about having the pistol &amp; it was found in his pocket &amp; he was indicted &amp; fined for it as above stated.</p>
<p>He prays your Excellency, therefore, to Exercise towards him your clemency and to remit the fine, &amp; especially as your petitioner is of limited means, dependant on his salary in a merchandizing house for his support; and as in duty bound, he ever will &amp;<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi></p>
