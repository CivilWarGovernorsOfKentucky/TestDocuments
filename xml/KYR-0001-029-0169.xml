<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>James F Robinson</p>
<p>Respected Sir at the <gap/> Term of the Fulton Equity &amp; criminal Court James H. Cayce was fined Sixty dollars for Keeping a tippling house I was commonwealths attorney for this Judicial district at the time, and the facts as developed by the testimony was these, M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Cacey had Tavern licens, to keep a tavern at Caceys Station on the Mobile &amp; Ohio rail road in Fulton County this state, The house that<pb/>
<lb/>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Cacey sold Whiskey was upon the same lot that his Tavern house was on but not under the Same roof. Cacey Exhibited his licens upon the trial, But the court was under the impresion, that a man who had Tavern licens Must sell his liquors or keep <hi rend="str">in</hi>^a^ Bar under the same roof of the house that was licenses as a Tavern and so Instructed the Jury, I know that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cacey was acting in good faith under his license, and really thought that it would make no<pb/>
<lb/>difference in law so he sold liquor or kept his Bar on the same lot that his Tavern house was, on, I have known M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Cacey a great While and Know that he is strictly a law abiding man and would no act in violation of law knowingly, he has therefore Sent your Excellency a petition, asking your Excellency to remit so much of the fine as in your power to remit</p>
<p>very Respectfully
<lb/>Your obedient Servant
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> H Corbett</p>
