<lb/><date when="1864-01-13">January the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1864</date>
<lb/>His Excellency the governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>I was in court when the fines spoken ^of^ in the foregoing petition were assessed and I was fully Satisfied from all that was developed on the trial that the old man (Gough) was wholly unconscious that he had violated the laws of this Commonwealth, by performing the acts for which he was Indicted - he is quite an<hi rend="str">d</hi> old &amp; poor man a good quiet peacible &amp; honest citizen &amp; if relieved as prayed for in the foregoing petition he will sin no more yours respectfully</p>
<p>Hiram M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Elroy<pb/></p>

<lb/>Relief Refused
<lb/>Tho E Bramlette<pb/></p>
<p>To His Excellency T. Bramlett
<lb/>Gov. of the Commonwealth of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir.</p>
<p>Your petitioners (the subscribers herto) would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1862">Spring terms 1862</date> and <date when="1863">1863</date> of the Union Circuit Court Mr. J. Gough was fined twice by said Court once at the <date when="1862">Spring term 1862</date> the sum of ten dollars for retailing liquor without a license and the other at the <date when="1863">Spring Term 1863</date>. for selling in an open place twenty dollars both suits attended with burdensome costs. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Gough is a good citizen of our county an old man now in the Sixty Eighth year of his age and laboring for his own support and said fines are very burdensome to him Wherefore we petitioner humbly pray Your Excllency to remit said fines and release the poor old man from their burdens</p>
