<lb/>Governor Thos. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Some time since I sent you a petition requesting your Excellency to remit a fine imposed upon me as surity upon a forfeited recognisance before the Hopkins Circuit Court. I desire to know if the petition was received &amp; hope that it was that you may see proper to grant the prayer of myself &amp; friends</p>
<p>The fine is only one hundred Dollars yet it is a large Sum for me to have to pay for no violation of law. I delivered the man up into the custody of the Hopkins Circuit Court its officers &amp; believed that I had then discharged my bond.- I would be pleased to know if my petition had been received and Considered by you &amp; hope that you may see proper to remit the fine- Very Respectfully </p>
<p>John. P. Price
