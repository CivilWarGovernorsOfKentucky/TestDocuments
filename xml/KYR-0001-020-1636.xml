<lb/>Dear Friend</p>
<p>Little Charley Petty comes to you asking a small favor which in my opinion under all the circumstances <hi rend="str">I think</hi> it will be well enough for you to grant. The offense that Charley is charged is his first and from the evidence in the case I think the verdict was not only unjust but even <hi rend="underline">cruel</hi>. Charley is quite young &amp; very sentitive &amp; confinement in Jail would most probably have the effect to degrade him in his own instruction &amp; thus have a bad instead of a salutary effect besides it occurs to my mind that the severe penalties of the law were only intended to reach men who were continually engagings in <unclear/> &amp; breaches<pb/>
<lb/>of the peace. Charley's father and mother are very much mortified over the affair and he has promised them to sin no more and ^I^hope it will agree with your notions of offical duty to interfere in his behalf.</p>
<p>We never whatever here since you left</p>
<p>Very sincerely
<lb/>Your friend
