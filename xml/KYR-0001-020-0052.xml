<p>Norphat Jones states, that he is a near neighbor to Thomas B. Wadlington, and has been intimately acquainted with him and his family for a number of years. He states that Thomas B. Wadlington is a good and kind neighbor a peaable and law abiding citizen and such is the general opinion of his neighbors. He further states, that he does verily believe that manifest injustice has been done him by the verdict of the jury. He states that he has been acquainted with the deceased <hi rend="str">and</hi> Cartwright ever since he was a child, and that he is and has been regarded as a violent, quarrelsome and very dangerous young man, and has been so generally regarded by his neighbors.</p>
<p>He further states that he does verily believe that the evidence of Prince and Blalock made a false impression on the minds of the Jury and induced the Jury to bring in a verdict, which in his opinion is wholly unjust, and does violence to the best interest of society.</p>
<p>He further states, that from his acquaintance with all the parties, and his familiarity with the ground and place where the killing took place, and the manner of the killing, and who commenced it he is induced to believe, that the evidence as detailed by Prince and Blalock as to who commened and brot on the difficulty is and was not true, and he does varily believe, that the kill<pb/>
<lb/>ing of Cartwright was in self defence.</p>
