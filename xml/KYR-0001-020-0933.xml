<lb/>Respected sir</p>
<p>At the <date when="1861-04">present April</date> term of our Equity &amp; Criminal Court H H Lock &amp; Nathan Goldsmith were each fined $50. under the law against selling spiritous liquors to minors and I understand that they have Petitioned your Exelency to remit said fines I therefore state that if you can consistent with your duty remit said fines that it would confer a lasting favor upon me as I <hi rend="str">am</hi> was the minor to whom the Spirits were sold for which they were fined I am not Twenty one years old and was in my Twenty first year at the date of said sale and believe they though when they sold me the spirits that I was of full age I do not believe that they hadd any intention of violating the law in selling me the spirits for which they were fined I am personally acquainted with Mess Lock &amp; Goldsmith and Know them both to be clever Gentlemen and believe that their case merits executive clemency.</p>
<p>Very respectfully
