<lb/>To his Excellency Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky
<lb/>Frankfort.</p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully State, that at the <date when="--06">June</date> Term of the Caldwell Circuit Court the Grand Jury returned into said Court, four Indictments charging them with keeping a Gaming House, setting up a "Jenny Lind" Table, upon which money property or other thing of value was won and lost -- two Indictments charging them with permitting minors to play upon said Table -- They state that they never did keep a Gaming House intentionally -- That they were the keepers of a retail grocery and drinking Saloon That they purchased said Table for no other purpose than to afford recreation &amp; amusement to their Customers and to attract custom to their House -- That their posted rules forbid all betting of every sort character and description That no Money was ever won or lost upon said Table and that all that was ever bet upon said Table was Liquor and Cigars and this without their knowledge -- They accompany their statement with the sworn statement of the Witnesses set down at the foot of the Indictment, that your Excellency may have the whole facts before you -- We are young Men with families and poor. We lost largely by the raid of the Rebel General Lyon and the payment of our debts is troubling us a great deal. We have never had an Indictment or Presentment against us before although we have been in business for the last eight or ten years -- And should your Excellency<pb/>
<lb/>fail to relieve we Shall be broken up and we again aver that it was never our purpose to violate the law </p>
<p>During the time we had said Table Our Soldiers were stationed at this place and they took possession of said Table when they pleased and did as they pleased against our remonstrance We again appeal to your Excellency to relieve us, it is the first time we were ever charged as violators of the law and ^it^ Shall be the last And by so doing You will save us from great loss <hi rend="str">to</hi> <hi rend="str">us</hi> and enable us to provide for our families -- We never permited any Minors to play upon the Table after we learned what the law was -- </p>
<p>E H Daniel &amp; Bro.</p>
<p>R T &amp; E H Daniel state that they believe the above statements to be true</p>
