<lb/>To His Excellency Thomas. E. Bramlette.
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>We the undersigned citzens of Harrison County, would most respectfully represent to his Excellency, Thos. E. Bramlette. Governor of Commonwealth of Kentucky; That at the <date when="1862-11">November Term of the Harrison Circuit Court for 1862,</date> John. H. Jackson was indicted for the crime of horse stealing, That he entered into bond in the sum of Five hundred dollars, with A. L. Hieatt &amp; George N. Burnes as his sureties, for his appearance at the <date when="1863-05">May Term 1863,</date> of said court, Jackson left this state in month of <date when="1862-12">December 1862,</date> and it is supped went to the state of Illinois, though nothing certain is known, as to his whereabouts. The motion to forfeit the bond was continued from court to court, upon the court's being satisfied; that the sureties were doing all in their power to bring Jackson to trial, The mercy of the court being exhausted, judgment was rendered against the sureties for the amount of the bond, We are fully satisfied that the sureties have done all they could to have Jackson arrested and brought to trial, and that they are in no way to blame for Jackson's default. The sureties are poor men, and it will be an unexpected and overwhelming misfortune to them, if they are subjected to the payments of this bond. Knowing this to be a case worthy of Executive clemency and mercy, and<pb/>
<lb/>feeling so well assured that it is a pleasure to your Excellency, to grant pardon to the innocent &amp; worty, we most respectfully recommend the said A. L. Hieatt and G. N. Burnes to your most merciful consideration.</p>
