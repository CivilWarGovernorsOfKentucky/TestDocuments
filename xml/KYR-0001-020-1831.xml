   <p>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, </p>
<p>The undersigned would state that on the <date when="1860-03-08">8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of March 1860</date> a warrant was issued by Thomas W Sellers a Justice of the Peace for Woodford County, against John M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Coy who was charged with felony. That upon the examination, before an examining. Court of sd Charge, Said M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Coy was held to further trial but allowed bail at the sum of $250#. That he gave bail, in said sum with one Philip Hendricks as his Security. That the condition of said bond was that said McCoy would appear in the Woodford Circuit Court at the April term next succeding the date of said bond, to answer said charge and would at all times render himself amenable to the orders and process of said Court in the prosecution of said charge and if convicted would render himself in execution thereof, or if he should fail to perform ^either of^ the conditions, that he would pay the Commonwealth the sum of two hundred and fifty Dollars. This bond was dated <date when="1860-03-08">8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> March 1860</date> and acknowledged same day. </p>
<p>Petitioners state that said M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Coy failed to appear in said Court at said April term in the charge of his bond and the same was forfeited, and Judgement rendered against said Hendreth for the sum of $250 -- which yet stands against him. </p>
<p>Now your petitioners state that said Philip Hendricks is a very old, palsied and poor man, with a family. His wife also an old woman is living. His whole estate will hardly pay the judgment, and if taken in execution, will utterly impoverish <hi rend="str">them</hi> and leave miserable and<pb/>
<lb/>unhappy <hi rend="str">paupers</hi> beggars for life. We are satisfied that Said Hendricks was not privy to the flight of said M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Coy and that he was prompted only by emotions of Kindness and humanity, in signing said bond, We therefore in view of all the facts and circumstances attending this case respectfully petition Your Excellency to remit so much of said forfeiture as you have power over. We believe such an act of Clemency will meet the approval of our whole community. <date when="1862-04-07">April 7. 1862</date></p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Jno K Goodloe
<lb/>Zeb Ward</p>
