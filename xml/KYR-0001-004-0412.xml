  <body>
   <p>To His Excellency Tho E Bramlette Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Stephen Stone would respectfully State That on the <date when="1861-07-06">6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of July 1861</date> he together with Geo W Rue &amp; others became the securities of Ephraim Brown in a recognizance in the Mercer Circuit Court (in which court he was Indicted for passing counterfeit money) <hi rend="str">I</hi> believeing the s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Brown to be innocent of the charge &amp; that he would appear &amp; stand his trial That before the day of trial the said Brown enlisted in the Union Army in the volunteer Company of Capt Abram Smith &amp; in the Regiment of Col Bruce in which Service he was on the day he was recognized to appear in the Mercer Circuit Court &amp; still is in s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Service</p>
<p>That subsequently your petitioner &amp; the s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Geo W Rue enlisted in the same service &amp; were not in Mercer County to attend to prevent the forfeiture of said recognisance That at the <date when="1862-04">April Term of s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Court 1862</date> said recognisance was forfeited &amp; a summons ordered to be found against the parties which was executed<pb/></p>
<p>on your Petitioner &amp; s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Rue <hi rend="str">and</hi> at the <date when="1863-10">October Term 1863</date> a judgment was rendered against them for the sum of $250 with $380 costs &amp; Fifa issued on same on the <date when="1863-11-09">9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of Nov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 1863</date> &amp; is now in the hands of the Sheriff of s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> county who is pressing the payment thereof</p>
<p>Now your petitioner would represent that owing to this attention being called to the service in which they were engaged &amp; the general interuption to the operations of the Courts business and the Knowledge that s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Browne was in the Service of the country &amp; could not be present to stand his trial they did not appear &amp; show cause (as they should have done) why s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> judgment should ^not^ have been rendered as your petitioner surely believes he could have done indeed your petitioner really has no recollection whatever of the Service of the summons on him</p>
<p>Now in as much as your <hi rend="str">Orater</hi> petitioner is remidiless except by the interposition of your Excellency all the circumstances considered he asks your Excellency to remit s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Judgment</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Stephen Stone<pb/></p>
