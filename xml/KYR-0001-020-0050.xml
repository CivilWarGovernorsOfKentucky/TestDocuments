   <p>Kentucky Caldwell County.</p>
<p>A. J. Lamb and Joshuay Stallons state that they are immediate Neighbors of Thomas B. Wadlington and they have long been acquainted with said Wadlington and with his general moral character. They say, that his general character is that of a peacable, orderly and good citizen; and is and has been so regarded by his neighbors and acquaintances. They further state, that they are acquainted with John Prince and James Blalock; and from their acquaintance with all the parties they are induced to believe and do believe, that the verdict of the Jury predicated on the evidence of said Prince &amp; Blalock does manifest injustice to said Wadlington, and they do verily believe, that the evidence of Prince and Blalock as to the manner of the attack and killing is not true. and they believe the killing of said Cartwright was unnecessary self defence.</p>
<p>They further state from their knowledge of the general character of said Blalock they do not believe him to be entitled to credit on oath as a witness.</p>
