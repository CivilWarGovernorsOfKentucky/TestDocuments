<p>This is to certify that I was one of the Jury who tried the afsd Wm Schofield; I was about Oakland about the time the money was alledged to have been Stolen; I knew Weaver ^he was a wagon master^. The man who lost the money, or said he lost it. I heard Weaver tell about it frequently; and he never heard him tell the Same Story twice; he was So frequently drunk; and he told so many different tales about it; and he had around him Such a bad Set a men; that I was led to beleave that it was uncertain whether he lost it at all; or if he did he I am Satisfied knew nothing about who got it. I was on the Jury and was greatly Susprized that Schofield plead guilty; we could not do anything else but find him So I Sign the petition with <hi rend="str">please and</hi> earnestly ask your executive clemency.</p>
