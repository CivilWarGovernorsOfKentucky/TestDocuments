<lb/>To His Excelency the Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Honoured Sir</p>
<p>During the setting of the Circuit Court of Kenton County <date when="1860-12">December term</date> I was on trial and fined fifty dollars for carrying a concealed weppon commonly called and Known as a billey. altho found guilty I deny eaver carrying or owning any sutch wepon, tis true I was found with the billey in my hand, the circumstance of the case is this my Older Brother Jacob Metz was engaged in a meelee or fight during the Election <date when="1860-08">last August</date> I being presant but not engaged untill I saw a third party asault and strike my Brother with a billey I rushed to the resque and succeeded in taking the billey from the said third party and retaining possesion but during my temporary abesence in the circuit court my case was called and in abesence of my selfe and witnesses on the mistaken evidance of one man I was found guilty and fine assesed as above which fine I pray your Elcelency to Remit as it is unjust in toto. I applied for a new trial but the press of buisiness debard me. I will venture to take the liberty of enclosing the affidaved<hi rend="sup">s</hi> in the case that your Honor may not think that I am attempting to impose &amp;c I could if requisite obtain all most the entire city as endorsers of my Good character and peacable disposition. but when a Brother is assaulted with a deadley weppon, it is cowardly, and unbecoming a son of Kentucky to not attempt a resque I resqued my Brother taking the deadley weppon from his oponant, which constitutes my onley crime for which I was tried and fined fifty dollars<pb/>
<lb/>I being a man of familey with limited means I think it extreemely hard if I should be compelled to pay said fine. I therefore most Respectf Pray you Excelency to Remit &amp;c</p>
<p>I will ever pray &amp;c
<lb/>Phillp Metz</p>
<p>To His Excelency Govenor of Kentucky
