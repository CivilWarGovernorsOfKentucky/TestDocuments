<p>This day W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Brown appeared before the undersigned and stated under oath that he was with Charles Hawkins at the time of his difficulty with Thomas Murray for which he was sentenced to the Penatentiary, when said Murray approached said Hawkins holliering at him in a loud voice in menacing language to which Hawkins said to him, why are you pursuing me on the streets in this manner when you Know said enemies who only wish a pretext to annoy and give one trouble -- but Murray being drunk still pursued him, when Hawkins turned upon him and cut him two or three times with the small old Carlow Knife, which is now shown me that the act was one of sudden impulse on the part of said Hawkins and without any previous malice whatever as both him and Murray had<pb/>
<lb/>been on terms of friendship up to that time</p>
<p>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> ^his X mark^ Brown</p>

<lb/>been friends</p>
