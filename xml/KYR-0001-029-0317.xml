   <p>Bowling Green Ky. <date when="1863-04-18">Apl 18th/63</date>
<lb/>To the Hon J, F Robinson Governor of Ky</p>
<p>Your petitioners beg to present the case of Charles Buckhanan, who was fined by the Warren Equity &amp; Criminal Court ^at its <date when="1862-08">August term 1862</date> for Fourteen Dollars^ for permitting slaves to assemble at his house -- The circumstances as we understand them are that several negroes met at s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> house without the knowledge consent of invitation of s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Buckhanan &amp; that often they had been there a short time s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Buckhanan ordered them to go to their respective homes. It was during Christmas week &amp; the slaves were generally permitted by their masters to spend the week pretty much as they pleased -- Buckhhanan is a poor man with a family to support, &amp; works well so far as we have ever heard &amp; is not able to pay s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> fine without taking the necessaries of life from his family -- Therefore we ^(his neighbors)^ most respectfully petition that he be released from s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> fine -- With much respect we are your humble petitions</p>
