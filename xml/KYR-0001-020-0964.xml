<p>I wrote you I could show by respectful citizens of this County that Rufus Jones' punishment was not more than his case demanded. I Send you some names and there will still come more, and I for one hope he will not be pardoned, as I cannot See that it will be of no benefit to him, my reason for Judging So is the way he has conducted himself Since he Killed my Nephew Henry Jenkins his conduct has not been good, he has violated the law since he has ^a^ Inditement against him and Wilson the man that was tried with Jones for the Killing, and I no off no rason he should be discharged, as for heath I have known him all of my life he has been sound and healthy So far as I know there has been letters wrote to you on the subject and will be still more,</p>
<p>Respectfully
