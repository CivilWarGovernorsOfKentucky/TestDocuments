   <p>Madisonville Ky <date when="1861-01-30">Jany 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1861</date>
<lb/>Dear Uncle</p>
<p>I write to you at this time for the purpose of enlisting, you, if possbile, in behalf of my friends friend</p>
<p>Judge Fuquay who is my partner in business has a brother in law who is condemned to be hung at Princeton Caldwell County on the <date when="1861-03-01">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> day of March next</date> <gap/> the judge &amp; I both believe and we think from good grounds, that his brother in Law, (Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Wadlington) is condemend by false, yes basely false testimony.</p>
<p>The jury in the case I am informed (and from such a source that I can not doubt it.) have <hi rend="underline">all</hi> signed a petition to the Governor to pardon or commute his punishment to confinement in the penitentiary, so have several hundred of the Citizens of Caldwell County and so have three to four hundred of the Citizens of this County.</p>
<p>Now Uncle you will at once see my object</p>
<p>It is to induce you to use your influeence with the Governor to pardon or commute the punishment.</p>
<p>I verrily believe that the prisenor ought to be pardoned</p>
<p>If you are willing to use<pb/>
<lb/>your influence to this effect it will doubtless confer a favor on a <hi rend="str">woman</hi> woman who has been a faithful virtuous and good wife and three children (who will if the sentance of the Court is carried out, will be orphans in the full meaning of the word You will also confer a favor on your Nephew</p>
<p>The whole family so far as I know is <hi rend="str">are</hi> in good health &amp; hope yours are in the same condition</p>
<p>I would like much to hear from you on the reception of this</p>
<p>Your Nephew
<lb/>Sam C Woodson</p>
<p>P S: The Petitions will be in Frankfort by the <date when="1861-02-15">15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Feby</date> &amp; I think sooner If you think proper to use your influence please do so at the very earliest moment</p>
<p>Now Uncle I am in earnest in what I say about the matter &amp; believe I am doing a duty that I would be amiss in not doing</p>
<p>S C Woodson</p>
<p>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir</p>
<p>If you can consistant with right &amp; Do justice relieve the widow &amp; children from widow hood &amp; orphanage <hi rend="underline">indeed</hi> I Know it will do your heart good to do so &amp; it will be truly gratifying to <hi rend="str">me</hi> us to learn you feel free in doing so.</p>
<p>Yours truly
<lb/>Ben C Allen
<lb/>Tho,, Allen</p>
