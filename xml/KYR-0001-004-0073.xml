<lb/>against
<lb/>Reed &amp; others Defts</p>
<p>To his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky -- I will state in the above stated suit the cheriff had taken insufficient security on a bail bond &amp; such negligence had got to be too common with officers in this district &amp; for the purpose of rectifying it I brought the suit &amp; obtained a Judgement as in here shown &amp; by it I think the evill intended to be rectified will be reminded &amp; it is especially needed in this county -- Yet in this especial case it works a peculiar hardship on the sheriff securities who are of the best citizens, good men in every sense of the word, but the sheriff himself has absconded &amp; left his said securities to pay large amounts of his defalcations as he is hopelessly insolvent &amp; therefore I take pleasure in asking your honor to remit this Judgement -- Your excellency may rest assured I shall never in any instance recommend executive clemency unless it is in a deserving case &amp; in such case will do so whether asked or not -- though I have to say my experience shows that heretofore executively clemency has been too lavish in this district -- yet in this case I think it is deserving</p>
<p>P D Yeiser
<lb/>Coml atty<pb/></p>
<p>I concur in the statements made within by Mr. Yeiser and believe that this case presents a proper case for the exercise of Executive clemency</p>
