<lb/>Dear Harned,</p>
<p>Your note came to hand, during my absence from home. I hasten to reply without consultation with any friends, as I expect to leave for Ohio on the morning train.</p>
<p>You are in the right place to work for ^James^ Ammerman. He is committed for trial at the <date when="--04">April term</date> of the Court. He is certainly guilty of forgery and will go to the Penitentiary, unless the Gov. Bramlette will pardon him. I understand that he is willing to go into the Army, if he can escape imprisonment.<pb/>
<lb/>none of the parties will interpose any objection, and if I were at home I could get them to petition the Gov. to that effect.</p>
<p>So get Gov. B. to interpose in his behalf before the trial, and take him into the battery.</p>
<p>No especial news about town.</p>
<p><date when="--06-16">June 16</date> additions to our church.</p>
<p>I go to Ohio, to purchase a home for Joel.</p>
<p>Very Truly
<lb/>W. C Lyle<pb/></p>
