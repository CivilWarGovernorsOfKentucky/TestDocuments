He says he made no defense to the indictment, because it was true, that he had suffered several gentlemen, who were at his house, to play some games of cards for money, by way of amusement, Your petitioner says that he is <hi rend="underline">very</hi> <hi rend="underline">poor</hi>, that he has a large family, mostly little girls, wholely dependant, on his personal exertions for their support, and maintenance, and that he is actually unable to pay said fine of two hundred dollars, and that he has no friends from whom he can borrow that amount of money until he could earn it, and that if he is arrested, being unable to pay as he is that his family will suffer for the necessaries of life, and the com'th would not be benefited by his incarceration, wherefore in view of the premises, he prays &amp; beseeches your Exc'y to remit, and for ever release him from the payment of the same, or so much thereof as to your Ex'cy shall seem proper, under the circumstances<pb/>
<lb/>and by so doing you will confer a lasting obligation not only on this petitioner, but on his helpless family -- </p>
