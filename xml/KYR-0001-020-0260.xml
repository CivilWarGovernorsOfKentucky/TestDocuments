   <p>Henderson <date when="1860-12">Dec 1860</date>,</p>
<p>The undersigned would respectfully represent to your Excellency that at the last <date when="1860-06">June Term</date> of the Henderson Circuit Court; a judgment was rendered against W. F. Dickey &amp; others for the sum of fifteen hundred dollars, on their bond as bail for Curtis Dickey, held to bail by the examining Court, to appear before the Henderson Circuit Court, to answer the charge of having killed one <gap/> Cobb, They state that W. F. Dickey is the only one against whom judgment was rendered, who is at all responsible -- that he is an old man, of small means, and would be ruined by the collection of so large an amount of money from him. He is a good citizen and an honorable man, and having become bail for his son, as every man would have done, is as deserving as any man in his situation could be, of Executive clemency, The only other one of the bail, who was worth any property, was one Thomas N. Sutton, who died before the judgment was rendered, leaving a very small estate and a family of helpless children, who would be left in want should one half the amount be made from their father's estate. They further state, they do not believe W. F. Dickey or any of the sureties, were privy or consenting to Curtis Dickey's escape -- In view of the facts herein set forth, we would respectfully petition your Excellency to remit as far as you have the power, the said judgment.</p>
