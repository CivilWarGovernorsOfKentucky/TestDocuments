<lb/>Dear Gov. </p>
<p>Enclosed I send you a petition asking the remission of a fine against J. G. Everett -- I had expected to present it in person but find that I will not be able to come to Frankfort until about the <date when="1861-09-20">20<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> of the month</date> -- The replevin bond is about due and it is of great importance to Everett to keep any execution from issuing against him at this time -- </p>
<p>If you can do so, it would be a great relief to him to respite it until <date when="1862-01-01">Jan. 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> 1862;</date> and when I come up I will state his case fully -- As all executions are stayed until <date when="1862-03">March next,</date> I hope that you will be able to prevent any from issuing against him until the time named, and thus save cost &amp;c -- </p>
<p>Please have the respite, if one is granted, sent to me immediately -- <pb/></p>
<p>Your message has been quite favorably received here by all classes so far as my observation extends -- </p>
<p>Truly Yours &amp;c
<lb/>J G Carlisle</p>
<p>Hon B. Magoffin
<lb/>Gov of Ky, Frankfort</p>
