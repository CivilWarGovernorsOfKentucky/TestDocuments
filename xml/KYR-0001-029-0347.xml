   <p>To his Excellency James F. Robinson, Govenor of Kentucky,</p>
<p>Your petitioner John Haley, says that he is a laborer, and has no other means of support than by his manual occupation as a day laboror; that he has a widowed mother dependent upon him for sustenance; that recently within the last few days he was wrongfully and unjustly charged with selling spiritous liquor to slaves, arrested and tried before Lewis L. Hawkins, a justice of the peace for Mason County, for said alleged offense; but he says they failed to prove said offense against him, and one witness proved that he had drank liquor at petitioner's house, he did not prove that he had paid for it, and the said justice fined him $20 and the costs. He says he never sold or gave liquor to slaves and he never retailed the same to any person, that he is poor and the payment of said fine &amp; costs will be a great hardship upon him. He therefore respectfully asks your excellency to remit the same,</p>
