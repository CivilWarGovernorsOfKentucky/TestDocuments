   <p>To his Excellency Hon Thos. E. Bramblette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner David Lee would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1865-03">March Term 1865</date> of the Pulaski Circuit Court he was fined the Sum of $50, for selling Liquor to a slave -- He states that the only Testimony in the case was -- that in a conversation, with C. Cloench the owner of the slave, about getting the slave to take back a $20 counterfeit bill which the petitioner had got from him -- this petitioner sd he had given the negro a gallon of Brandy and $16 in money. Your Petitioner states that the slave never did get any liquor from him and the witnesses were mistaken as to the statements made by him in the conversation, because at the time he denied ever letting the slave boy have any liquor. There was no proof before the Jury that he had sold a drop to the slave, He asks that the sd fine be remitted</p>
<p>David Lee</p>
<p>I know the facts of the case and they are as stated by Mr Lee The fine should be remitted -- </p>
