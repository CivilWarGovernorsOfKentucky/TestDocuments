<lb/>To His Excellency J F Robinson
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Dear Sir; From a knowledge of your Patriotic zeal for the Union &amp; fidelity to the interests of Union men I am encouraged to send you a correspondence in reference to myself. Believing you to desire the welfare of all truly loyal men I am in a measure relieved of that embarrassment natural to one writing under similar circumstances my object in communicating with you is that you would lend your influence in securing me a situation as chaplain in some Regiment. I am now a union refugee in this city. It is unsafe for me to take charge of a congregation in Kentucky, simply because I felt it my duty<pb/>
<lb/>when the Rebel Morgan first invaded my native ^state^ to buckle on a "revolver", shoulder a double barreled shot gun, &amp; go with other native Kentuckians in purusit of the robber (for he is but little less). I am conscious that to do the whole duty of a chaplain is quite laborious; yet I have concluded I would rather undergo fatigue for men, fighting for my Country, than go back into Kentucky and have a tolerably easy time and yet be insulted by secessionists. It does not become me to recommend my own qualifications. I will only make a few statements, which I should do. I am a member of the Kentucky Conference: a graduate of Dickinson College (Penn): a Son of the Rev Wm M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>D. Abbett so well beloved by the Senate and House of Representatives. Let this suffice. If it is <hi rend="underline">necessary</hi> I will come immediately to Louisville. Direct your correspondence To no. 95 Walnut. St Cin. I have the honor to be your obedient servant.</p>
<p>H. Winslow. Abbett</p>
