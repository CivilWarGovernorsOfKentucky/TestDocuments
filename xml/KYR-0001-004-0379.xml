  <body>
   <p>To
<lb/>His Excellency Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor State of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned petitioner would respectfully state that he is a poor man, without any means of support, except his daily labor as Janitor of Medical Department of the University of Louisville that he has a wife and children depending on his labor for a living.</p>
<p>He states that the night of the <gap/> day of <date when="1863-12">December 1863</date> he was directed by the property authority to accompany D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> F. P. Satterwhite who is the demonstrator of Anatomy in said University to get a subject. That they went together for the purpose, and obtained two subjects, one a negro and the other a pauper, that they were arrested by the Police as they returned and placed in Jail and remained until Monday</p>
<p>This petitioner was subsequently indicted and fined one Hundred<pb/>
<lb/>dollars.</p>
<p>This petitioner states that he did in this matter, as he suffered nothing more than his duty, that it ^is^ absolutely necessary to secure and the Medical department of this University to have subjects, that in this Matter the deceased persons had no known friends or relations whose feelings were harassed or annoyed and that it is the uniform role of this University to get such subjects would in any harass or annoy friends or relations.</p>
<p>He asks your excellency to remit the said fine</p>
<p>Peter Vimer</p>
<p>Governor Bramlette,</p>
<p>A Profs of one of our Medical schools, in company with the Janitor of the school, in the night time Entered <hi rend="str">a grave yard</hi> ^the Potters field of the city^ &amp; took thereupon the body of a pauper, &amp; negro man, and on their way to the school, were, arrested by policeman. A Judgment was rendered as stated in the petition. I have carefully thought about this matter, and believe that although the statute was violated -- it has been indicated -- and considering the absolute necessity for this Flourishing school, to<pb/>
<lb/>have subjects for dissection for the diffusion of science in the proffession being taught by the Profsr. I respectfully ask for a remission</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>W G Reasor
<lb/>city atto</p>
<p>I concur with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Reasor
<lb/>Geo. W. Johnston J. C. Ct.</p>
<p>We earnestly hope his excellency Gov Bramlette will remit the above mentioned fine</p>
<p>It seems to me that a more righteous case for the Governor's interposition could not be presented All the facts are well known to me.</p>
