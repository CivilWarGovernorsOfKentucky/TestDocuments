   <p>Hon. Thomas E Bramlett
<lb/>Gov. of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your petitioners W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> H Covington and Caroline Covington, humbly Sheweth and represent unto you, that at the <date when="1864-04">last April Term</date> of the Christian Circuit Court, <hi rend="str">the</hi>I W H Covington, husband to the Said Caroline, on Indictment in Said court, for tipling, (making no defense to the Same) was fined Sixty Dollars -- We beseech and pray your Honor to remit So much of Said fine. as in your wise discretion, you can -- for the following reasons; The said Indictment was found for acts in violation of law, done while the Rebel Army had pessession of this county and country; my husband is and has been all the time a Strictly loyal man, and while the Rebels had possession of this County my Said husband was compelled to leave his home, and keep secreted, and was not permitted to be with his family; And being very poor and having a large family of children, principally females, I Caroline, was compelled to do Some=<pb/>
<lb/>thing for a Support for my self and helpless family; and having only a Small amount of money, thought I could best maintain my family in the absence of my husband, in food, by buying a little whiskey, to get Some ready money for that purpose -- My Husband W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Covington was not at home, and I was only Selling the liquor, as a means to obtain meat and bread to feed myself and little children until the Rebels could be driven out of the county, and my husband permitted to remain at home and work for a Support -- My house was not a disorderly one, and those to whom I sold, Would not be permitted to drink it my house; but had to leave the place -- M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> Covington Says that She is very poor and has a large family of Small children, who are not able to assist her to maintain her family, when her Husband cannot Stay at home to work for them -- She says it was with no intention of lawlessly acting -- or violating the laws of her<pb/>
<lb/>State, that She Sold whiskey; but the Courts for the time being Suspended, She desired only to make a living for her family; that her Husband was not the party who Sold, but herself, trying to Support her family, as best She could, while the Rebels had driven her Husband from his home, and robed her of his protecting care and assistance -- </p>
<p>In view of these facts, She prays your <hi rend="str">h</hi>Honor, to remit So much of the fine, as by law you can -- And relieve a poor Woman of the hardships, that now and for three years have distressed her and her helpless family -- And as in duty bound She will ever pray. and remember &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>W H Covington
<lb/>Caroline Covington</p>
