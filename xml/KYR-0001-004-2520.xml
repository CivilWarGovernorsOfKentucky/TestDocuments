   <p>His ExcellencyTho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E Bramlett
<lb/>Governor of the Com<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully represent that at the <date when="--10">Oct</date> term of the Grant Circuit Court he was fined in the sum of five hundred dollars for an assault &amp; Battery on the person of one H D Strotten That the said Strotten had inhumanly whipped his (petitioners) child -- and your petitioner while under the influence of the passion which had been created by the act of inhumanity by the said Stratton assaulted and whipped him</p>
<p>Your petition would further represent that he is &amp; has always been a law abiding man but that he is man of quick impulse and strong passion and in this act was overwhelmed and subjugated by his passion which were wrought up to an ungovernable pitch</p>
<p>He further represents that he is sorry for the act upon reflection and certainly would not have done so unless he had been under the influence of the passion afs<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi></p>
<p>He further represents that there was no other witness proving the nature of the assault but the man assaulted and the petitioner was unable to correct the impression -- <pb/>
<lb/>made upon this minor by this statement of the said witness and as to unpredudicias evidence was in a helpless condition</p>
<p>He further represents that he is a poor man and has not the means to pay this fine but will surely attempt in the future to keep a strict watch over his acts</p>
<p>He therefore prays your Excellency to remit so much of this fine as is in your power and in so doing you will greatly relieve your petitioner and his family</p>
<p><date when="1865-10-27">Oct 27 -- 1865</date></p>
<p>G. W. Grant</p>
<p>The undersigned members of the bar neighbors and friends of petitioner Join him in the above representation and hope Your Excellency will grant his request,</p>
