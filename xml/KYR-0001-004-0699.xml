That the said pistol was not the property of this petitioner, that it was handed to him on the morning of the day that he was arrested with direction to carry the pistol to a neighbor of his living several miles in the country- that after receiving the pistol. Your petitioner drank some liquor. and while under its influence. a dispute arose between he and a friend of his and the pistol was drawn during the quarrel. that he is a very quiet man. and never before carried a concealed weapon of any kind. that said pistol was given back to him after the trial. and that he carried &amp; handed the same to Lewis Harrod his neighbor, and the owner of the said pistol. Wherefore he prays that your Excellency will limit so much of said fine, as is not due &amp; coming to the officers of the city &amp; the costs of witnesses-</p>
