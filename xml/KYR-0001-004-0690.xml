   <p>Greenville Muhlenberg Co
<lb/><date when="1864-04-11">April 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1864</date>
<lb/>Gov Bramlette</p>
<p>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir: About the first of <date when="--11">last November</date> I addressed you a petition to strike from the dockets of the Muhlenberg Circuit Court two indictments found against me for permiting gaming in my law office. The Offences were committed at the breaking out of this war by recruits for the U S Army then occupying the town of Calhoun under Brig Gen Crittenden. No money was plaid for. Oysters whiskey and cigars were plaid for. I entered my protest at the time as will be observed by the statements of the witness for the Comlth accompanying My former petition Your Excellency declined to interpose during the pendency of the cause but stated that you thought the Atty for Commonwealth ought to enter a nolle prosequie upon the reception of your letter I used my energies and influence to obtain folough for soldiers that they might be in attendance. I obtained the attendance of one of the witness for the Commonwealth and upon his statement the atty for the Commonwealth very promptly dismissed one of the indictments Not being able to procure the witness<pb/>
<lb/>to the other that they might make a statement to Atty for the Commonwealth of the facts; and the indcitment having been drawn by a protem Atty I could not insist on a dismissal. The Commonwealths Atty and the Clerk being so well satisfied that no violation of the law was intended they proposed to me to let the Judgment go by confession and they would release their fees, before I <hi rend="str">did this I</hi> accepted their proposition I consulted his Hon Judge Petree who thought that it was the best way to avoid notoriety and said that he had no doubt that upon "the facts being presented you would at once be as generous as the comth atty and clerk" acting upon this advice I permitted Judgment to go for the sum of $<hi rend="underline">200</hi>.00. The Judgement against me embraced the attys and clerks release of fees.</p>
<p>I think that this is a meritorious defense; if any violation of law had been intended <hi rend="str">to</hi> I would not ask for the interposition of Executive Clemency but as there was none and no harm resulted from amusement of soldiers it seems to me that it would be hard to compel me to pay the Judgement. This matter I leave to the Kindness and Justness of your Excelency.</p>
<p>Having my ^business^ process in<pb/></p>
<p>process of settlement for the purpose of removing to Washington City to Practice law I would be pleased to hear from you at your earliest convenience</p>
<p>If the facts stated in this letter do not satisfy your Excelency I doubt not that I will be able to obtain nine tenths of the Pf the population of this county to endorse this and request a remission.</p>
<p>I Remain Your Obt --
