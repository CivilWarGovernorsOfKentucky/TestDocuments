<lb/>Hon Thos. E. Bramlette:</p>
<p>At the late term of the Kenton Circuit Court Felix McDermot was convicted of grand larceny and is now in the penitentiary -- I was at the time of his conviction acting as Commonwealths attorney &amp; consequently heard all the testimony -- In my opinion the evidence of his guilt was conclusive, but at the same time he proved a previous good character by several respectable witnesses. I am informed by reliable parties that his wife and children are in very destitute circumstances. and in view of this fact and of the fact that this was his first offense, I unite with the petitioners who ask a pardon for him -- and would be gratified to see it granted</p>
