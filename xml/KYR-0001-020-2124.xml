<lb/>Hon B Magoffin
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I have been in this city for some days past awaiting an interview with your Excellency in relation to my friend F M Searcy</p>
<p>The facts set forth in his petition are true I was a member of the first Grand Jury and his case was thoroughly investigated -- All of the testimony for the Commonwealth was adduced and upon a vote they failed to find an indictment</p>
<p>At the next term of the court of my own personal knowledge two of the Grand Jurors who had<pb/>
<lb/>been selected by the companies were voluntarily excused from service by the Judge and two others put in their stead of the court selection</p>
<p>The Judge telling the excused Members that a matter would come up in which a friend of theirs was <unclear/> -- </p>
<p>The foreman of the Jury ^that found the indictment^ &amp; one other member were cousins of the deceased Caperton</p>
<p>There is no politics in this case and after M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Searcy, acquitted by the examining court generally <unclear/> <unclear/> sustained their finding</p>
<p>I ask you to pardon M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Searcy and am positivey certain your action will be approved by our community</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>D W Chenault</p>
