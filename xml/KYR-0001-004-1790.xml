<lb/>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Bramlette
<lb/>Dr Sir.</p>
<p>In the Case of the Comwlth vs Baldwin and Gaslin on Scfa the Court rendered a judgment against Gaslin this term</p>
<p>I think this is a Case that needs your interference</p>
<p>I shall state the facts as they occurred and let you decide for yourself -- when the Case of Baldwin was Called for trial, he and his bail both appeared -- after the <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> ^deft^ had responded that he was ready for trial the bail left the Court House supposing he was no longer needed -- after some moments Conversation the Commonwealth Concluded to Continue the Case, and when<pb/>
<lb/>he was asked to renew his bond he replied his bail had returned home -- The Judge remarked to him, that he had an honest face and he would trust him to go and find his bail -- </p>
<p>Baldwin left for that purpose and never returned -- </p>
<p>On the next day I Called the Judge's attention to the fact that Baldwin had not returned. He thereupon had him called and his bond forfeited</p>
<p>In answer to the Scire facias Gaslin replied that inpursuance of the obligation, of his bond the had surrendered the prisoner into Court, and supposing his obligations fulfilled he had ceased to look after the prisoner The Court however rendered judgt against the bail</p>
<p>Yours Truly J P Chambers<pb/></p>
<p>I was unable to attend Court at the time the above case was called on account of illness, but am informed from a reliable source that the above statement is strictly true</p>
<p>J R Dupuy</p>
<p>and I further state that from all the circumstances I believe that Gaslin intended to do as required by law</p>
