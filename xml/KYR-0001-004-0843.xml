   <p>To His Excellency Gov: Bramlette</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Louisville respectfully state that George Light was convicted of larceny in the Jefferson Circuit Court three years ago <date when="--01">last January</date> was then taken to the Penitentiary and has been confined there ever since</p>
<p>He was indicted &amp; convicted for stealing seventy five dollars. We learn and believe that the money was ^afterwords^, restored to the owner.</p>
<p>The facts are that the person from whom the money was taken had ridden in a hack which Light was then the owner of and the passenger refusing to pay a fee of one dollars for the use of the hack Light took the carpet sack of the passenger to pay himself and it turned out afterwards that the sack had the sum of seventy five dollars in it. For this Light was convicted.</p>
<p>We think if he was really guilty of larceny, that the object ^of the law^ has been <hi rend="str">sufficiently has been</hi> accomplished. Imprisonment such as Light has already suffered is <unclear/> <unclear/> enough. We respectfully ask you to remit the balance of the punishment. We ask you to pardon him<pb/></p>
