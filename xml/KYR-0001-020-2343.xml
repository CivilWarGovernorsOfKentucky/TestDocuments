Hough Johnson Clark &amp; the said Troutman, All the parties were acquitted except Troutman, he was unable to attend the trial on account of his wife's sickness; all the others were present at the trial, and many of them had more to do with the transaction than Troutman, &amp; they were acquitted. Troutman lives in <hi rend="str">Mclean</hi> ^Davies^ county a long distance from the place of trial. He is a very poor &amp; industrious man with a family &amp; wholly unable to pay the fine if enforced against him it will bring his family to utter destitution we respectfully ask your excellency to remit said fine.</p>

<p>We the undersigned were a part of the jury that tried the case within named of Troutman, he was not present at the trial, the other defendants who were acquitted were present; and we are satisfied that the verdict has done Troutman injustice as were are now satisfied he had less to do with the transaction for which the indictment was found than many of the other defendants who were acquitted. He is a very poor man with a family &amp; unable to pay the fine &amp; if enforced it will bring his family to want. We respectfully ask your excellency to remit said fine.</p>
