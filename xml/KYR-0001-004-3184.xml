   <p>To his Excellency Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Gov. of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner William Graham (man of col) Says that he was jointly indicted with another man named Morton on a charge of Stealing a pair of boots, and upon trial was convicted, and Sent to the State Penitentiary for <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi></p>
<p>He says that he and Morton were working for Mr Ormsby of Jefferson County. One day they came in to the city of Louisville, Stayed awhile, and started out home. As they went along the Street Morton Steped into a Shoe &amp; Boot Store He walked along slowly until Morton overtook him when he came up he had a pair of boots; which he Said he had bought. Morton took the boots out home and in a few days a Policeman came out and arrested both of us. We were tried and unfortunately we got a lawyer, who was young and without experience; and who neglected to <hi rend="str">get</hi> name my witnesses Summoned; and I was convicted; when I am <hi rend="str">as</hi> innocent of the crime charged. If I had been properly defended I could have been accquitted. But I had no money or friends then to employ a good lawyer- and I was both neglected and unskillfully defended. Hence my conviction<pb/>
<lb/>Indeed it seems that ours, is a hard fate now. Without any interested friends to watch after and care for us, with a bitter hate and uncompromising prejudice of some against us, we have a hard time of it.</p>
<p>I dont know that I can satisfy you of my innocence; but hoping and praying that I may I ask you to pardon &amp; release from prison and restore me to liberty &amp;c</p>
<p>William Graham as he states was working for me at the time of his arrest. he was a good hand to work. I have known his father for ten years and have always thought him a worthy man</p>
<p>Hamilton Ormsby</p>
<p>To. His. Excellency. Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Gov. State of Ky.</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Louisville and Jefferson County, would respectfully ask and pray your Excellency to pardon the boy Wm Graham, on account of his youth- being only about 18 years old; and he protests that he had nothing to do with the boots that he is innocent. We know his father; and know him to be a most excellent and industrious man. We think it better for him (the boy), and not prejudical to the public welfare, and therefore respectfully ask your Executive clemency</p>
