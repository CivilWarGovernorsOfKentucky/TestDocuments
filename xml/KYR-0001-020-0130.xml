<lb/>Hon. Bariah M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>By request of a friend and neighbour I trouble you with a few lines in regard to a fine assessed against him at the last term of the Knox Circuit Court the fine is against Granville S<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> John for illegal gaming ($20) I can say to you that S<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> John is an honest labouring man has a clever respectable family a delicate wife (the daughter of Co<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Ambros Arthur) he is a poor man and his family entirely dependant on his labor for support, he is a kind hearted man and a good citizen but unfortunately he some times (but seldom) takes a little too much of the <hi rend="underline">Critter</hi>, and at one time while under its influence he was induced to go in to a game where there was a few dimes won &amp; lost. and for which he was indicted, though he is not considered a gambler, he was fined 20$ and the cost is about 15$</p>
<p>Now I will say to you as an honest man that I think it would be an act of charity and justice to remit the fine, for his family actually kneed every dollar of his earnings and all one can say against him is that he is and always has been a determined died in the wool Democrat (at least that is my greatest objection to him)</p>
<p>I Know your are annoyed a greateal with cases of this kind and you will please pardon me for troubling you in this I would not do it if I did not think it was actually right &amp; charitable.</p>
<p>your ob<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> servant
<lb/>John Word<pb/></p>
<p>P. S I am requested to say to that if you require or will hear a petition in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> John<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> behalf he can send you one with the signature of the Judge the Commonwealth'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> attorney and as many others as you may want -- he wishes to hear from you soon as the sheriff is after him with a sharp stick</p>
