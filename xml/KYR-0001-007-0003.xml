   <p>C. W. COOK,
<lb/>Attorney at Law,
<lb/>DIXON, KY.,</p>
<p>Will practice his profession in the Circuit Courts of Webster, Union and Hopkins Counties.</p>
<p>Special attention given to the securing and collection of Claims.</p>
<p>Office of C. W. Cook
<lb/>ATTORNEY AT LAW,
<lb/>Dixon, Ky., <date when="1863-09-04">Septr 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1863</date>
<lb/>Dr Sr</p>
<p>At the <date when="--08">last August</date> election in this (Webster) County William Clarke was a candidate for the office of Justice of the peace for District No 2 without opposition and received a large vote. There was a vacancy in the office occasioned by a failure to elect a justice for said district at the <date when="--05">last May</date> election and at the <date when="--08">august</date> election there had been no writ of election issued which I suppose rendered Mr Clarks election illegal &amp; void</p>
<p>Mr Clarke is a man however in every way well qualified to fill the office. He is a union man of undoubted loyalty and his appointment would command the approval of the union men of his District. In view of these facts and at the solicitation of many of his friends I would respectfully solicit his<pb/>
<lb/>appointment to fill the existing vacancy in said office </p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>C W Cook County. Judge
<lb/>M C Davis " Clk</p>
