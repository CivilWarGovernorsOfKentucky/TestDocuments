And your petitioner supposes from the testimony that the said whisky was taken off of his premises, on to an adjoining premises (entirely out of the sigh of plaintiffs wife, a half mile more or less) and was there drank, without the knowledge and against the consent of Your petitioner or his wife; that the said liquor was not then paid for nor has it been paid for since nor has the same ever been charged to any person whatever;;</p>
<p>He states that his wife had let out the liquor without his knowledge and without his consent<pb/>
<lb/>if not against his positive commands -- Wherefore he prays Your excellency will remit said fine and will ever pray</p>
