<lb/>Gov Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I enclose an attested copy of an Indictment pending in the Hart Circuit Court against James Vance for horse stealing. Vance has fled from Justice, and is now located in the State of Illinois. I wish ^you^ to make the usual requisition upon the Governor of Illinois for his arrest and delivery to the Authorities of this state.</p>
<p>He is rather a notorious thief, and a bad man and ought to be punished</p>
<p>A McHatton whose mare was stolen has ascertained the County in which Vance is now located in Illinois. And I suggest that you appoint Mr. McHatton the agent of the State to receive the fugitive.</p>
<p>If you will make such appointment, he (McHatton,) will take the requisition papers in person to the Governor of Illinois. And attend the officers of that State, receive the fugitive &amp; bring him to Kentucky. The appointment of McHatton would I know be a good appointment<pb/>
<lb/>I know him well, and testify that he is prudent and sensible, Does not seek the position, for any improper motive, will not in any way mistrust the prisoner, but simply desires that he should be brought to Justice, and not longer evade the law.</p>
<p>The Post Office address of Mr. McHatton is Bacon Creek Hart County, you can send the papers directly to him or forward them to me as your may prefer, &amp; I can send them to him</p>
<p>Respectfully &amp;C,
<lb/>W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> B. Jones<pb/></p>
<p>Requisition upon Illinois
