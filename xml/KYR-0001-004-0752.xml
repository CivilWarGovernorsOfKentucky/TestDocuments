<lb/>To his Excellency Gov. Bramblet</p>
<p>Dear Sir. Your Petitioner Andrew Blount was fined by a Judgment of the Nicholas Circuit Court at its <date when="1859-03">March Term 1859</date> in the sum of $30 for gambling </p>
<p>He says he was under an impression that the amount had been remitted by your predecessor, but finds he was mistaken </p>
<p>He says he has lately been discharged from the Federal Army ^Co. H. 18<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky. Regt.^ for disability and is unable to work.</p>
<p>He says he cannot pay this Judgment without distress to himself &amp; family; that he is poor, owns no land &amp; dependent on the very limited ability he has now to work &amp; manage for the support fo this family. He has a wife in poor health &amp; five children dependent entirely upon him.</p>
<p>He prays you will remit the Judgment above. A Blount</p>
<p>We are acquaintances of Andrew Blount &amp; believe the statements above. We recommend the prayer of the Petition <date when="1864-04">April <gap/> 1864</date></p>
