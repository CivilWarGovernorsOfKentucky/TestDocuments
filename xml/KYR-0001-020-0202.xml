   <p>To his excellency the govenor of Kentucky, Beriah Magoffin</p>
<p>Your petitioner John Murry says one John Lenard commited an offense against the laws of this state by stabing one Patrick Daugherty, for which offense he was held in bonds for his appearance at the <date when="1860-10">October term of the Anderson circuit Court, held in 1860</date>, in the sum of one hundred dollars, that this petitioner being the friend of said Lenard went as surity on his bail bond for his appearance, that said Lenard failed to make his appearance at Court, and that thereby said bond was forfeited. This petitioner further says that the said Daugherty has since recovered from his wound, He further says that he is a poor man and has to make his living by labouring on public works, and if he should have the one hundred dollars to pay, it will considerably<pb/>
<lb/>embarrass him, He therefore prays that your executive clemency be extended to him and that you remit said fine or forfeture</p>
<p>John Mury says the statements of the foregoing petition are true.</p>
<p>John Murray</p>
<p>Subscribed &amp; sworn to before me by John Murray. <date when="1860-11-02">Nov 2 1860</date></p>
