   <p>State of Kentucky,
<lb/>Gallatin Circuit Court:</p>
<p>Whereas it has been made known to me that William Ross, who stands indicted in the Gallatin Circuit Court for the murder of Wm. H. Kelly on the <date when="1859-07-06">6th of July, 1859</date>, has twice been arrested on said charge and confined in the Jail of Gallatin County, and has twice broken and escaped from said Jail, and is now at large and unpunished in the State of Missouri, in open defiance of justice and the laws of this Commonwealth: and whereas it is represented to me that said murder was committed by the said Ross shooting said Kelly while Kelly was plowing in the field, from ambush, I therefore request the Governor of Kentucky to offer a suitable reward for the apprehension of said fugitive.</p>
<p>Given under my hand, as Judge of the Gallatin Circuit Court, at Warsaw, Gallatin County, Ky., this <date when="1864-03-16">16th of March, 1864</date>.</p>
<p>Geo. C. Drane
