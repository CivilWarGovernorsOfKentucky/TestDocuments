   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette Governor of the state of Kentucky; Your petitioner Frederick Ampher respectfully states that at the <date when="1863-11">November Term 1863</date> of the Campbell Circuit Court true bills were found against him, charging him with the offense of selling liquor to minors in four different cases; that at the same term he at once promptly went to R. B. Carpenter Esq<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. the attorney for the Commonwealth and informed him that he was about to pay a visit to his former home in Germany and would be absent at the next Term of the Court in <date when="1864-05">May</date> and requested a continuance of the cases until he should return from Germany; M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Carpenter consented and it was agreed that the cases should be continued accordingly; When the <date when="1864-05">May</date> Term came and your petitioner was still absent in Germany and Mr Carpenter was absent from Court &amp; the cases being called <hi rend="str">&amp; no defense being made by Deft</hi> Judgement was rendered agst. your petitioner fineing him fifty dollars in each case &amp; costs -- Now your petitioner says that he could have successfully defended all of said Cases had he have had an opportunity to make defense and could well show that the prosecutions were groundless and were instigated by malice in each instance -- Your petitioner therefore respectfully asks the Governor to remit the said fines and judgements=</p>
