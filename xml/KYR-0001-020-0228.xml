<lb/>R. R. Bolling Esq
<lb/>Frankfort, Ky
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>The Enclosed petition is as you will see for the Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> -- I send it and the papers therein refered to, to you knowing that you will Either in person, or by some friend, if your relations with his Excellency should be such that you can not do so yourself, have them attended to. I am satisfied the fines ought to be remitted, &amp; my friends Higgins &amp; Berry will be very much obliged by any aid you may have it in your power to render them -- </p>
<p>I hope that all unpleasant feelings between the democrats of this state in consequence of the late unfortunate split will cease. I was for Beckinridge myself -- but I know many good democrats were for Douglass, &amp; the contest as between them being over we should bury in oblivion if possible all animosities growing out of it, and stand united for our rights under the constitution, preserving the Union, if indeed it be not too late now, to do so. But at all Events we should ^stand^ up to the last for state rights.</p>
<p>Very truly your fr<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi>
<lb/>N. A. Smith</p>
<p>P. S Be kind Enough to let me hear from you soon as the Shff is pressing Huggins &amp; Berry for the money.<pb/></p>
<p>R. R. Bolling Esq
<lb/>Frankfort
<lb/>Ky.</p>
