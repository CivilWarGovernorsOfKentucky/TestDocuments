<p>Your petitioner says that the water, out of the accumulation of which &amp; the unhealthy affects arising there from, the Commonwealth relied in the prosecution under said Indictment, is situated upon the ground at the S. W. corner of Russell St &amp; Covington Avenue. and that your petitioner had sold &amp; conveyed all the ground he at any time owned, upon which said water touched, during the month of <date when="1864-01">January 1864,</date> as will appear by the County Records.</p>
<p>He says that he had employed Atty &amp; was prepared to make showing of the above on trial, but that verdict was had against him &amp; judgment for $100<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> in the temporary absence of his atty. He sends his affidavit herewith which was submitted to the court upon motion for a new trial -- which motion was over ruled.</p>

<lb/>of said fine to the extent that the law permits -- </p>
