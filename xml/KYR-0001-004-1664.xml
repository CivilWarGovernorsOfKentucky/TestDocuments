   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E. Bramlett. Gov. of Ky</p>
<p>Your petitioner would state that he was indicted in the Barren Circuit Court sometime back for an assault made opon one Joseph Bery. And was too unwell to attend the trial and was fined $150. that judgment being so outrageous and rendered in the absence of your Petitioner, that he appealed to your Excellency and you remitted so much of it as was in your power to do, for which he is thankfull.</p>
<p>He states that the time since judgment was rendered the atty for the Commonwealth took a forfeiture of his bail bond for his appearance under said indictment and at the <date when="1865-03">March term 1865</date> of said Court obtained a judgment for $100 against your Petitioner upon said forfeiture,</p>
<p>Your petitioner states that upon the 2<hi rend="str"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi><hi rend="sup">nd</hi> day of the term at which ^said^ trial was had for said Assault he attended Court with his witnesses he was Summoned upon a jury on said second day of Court to try a man charged with murder and continued upon said jury until late a fridy evening after Tuesdy. When he went home some ten miles, intending to return the next day to Court with his witnesses to be ready for his own trial, but was taken that night <hi rend="str">was</hi> with a violen<hi rend="str">s</hi>t attack of such head ache, to which he is very subject<pb/>
<lb/>which attack he thinks was superinduced by seting in the Court room for severel days upon said jury near to two stove fires. And on saturdy morning he was too sick to to attempt to go to town, and did not go, in ^the^ forepart of that day he was very sick towards noon he felt a little better, and did go to Cave city 2 miles to get some coffee but the evening he got worse and continued so nearly all the next day Sundy. but got better by the next (mondy) day and started to town with his witnesses, to attend said trial, but was informed the trial had been on saturdy, he dismissed his witnesses, but went on to town himself, your petitioner has been this particular in seting out the foregoing facts to show to your Excellency that it was no fault of his that he did not appear in discharge of said Bail bond, and having been tried in his abcense as already stated, he supposed the atty for the Commonwealth w<hi rend="str">as</hi>ould certainly dismiss the summons upon the level, but he refused to do so, a trial was had When your petitioner was poorly prepared to show his true condition upon said day of trial when he was fined for said assault, though he introduced two witnesses, he has since obtained some affidavits which he here sends you<pb/></p>
<p>He thinks this judgment of $100.00 wrong from the begining to the end, that it is unjust and a great hardship, that he is a poor man and labors under much bodily affliction, He therefore asks your Excellency to remit said fine</p>
