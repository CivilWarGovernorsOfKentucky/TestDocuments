   <p>The Hon. E. M Stanton
<lb/>Secretary of War.</p>
<p>Lieut Buffum, of Mitchells great Rail Road Expedition, who has resigned the Commission you gave him, was arrested in Louisville on a charge of stealing a pair of boots, and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment in the Kentucky State Prison. I do not know whether he is guilty or not, but even if he is, should not his services and sufferings in the nations cause form a reason for mercy being shown to him now. He has a wife and several small children depending on him, who long mourned him as dead, while he was in the hands of the rebels, and are now almost in despair at this new misfortune.</p>
<p>Will you not please to investigate this matter, and see if it is not a proper case for the exercise of executive clemency. A recommendation from you to Gov. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi> Goffin, would doubtless secure his release.</p>
<p>After you have already done so much for our party of adventurers, I think you will not hesitate to grant this additional favor.</p>
<p>With deep respect
<lb/>Your Obed<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> Servant
<lb/>(signed) W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Pittinger</p>
