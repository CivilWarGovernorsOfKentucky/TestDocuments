   <p>To His Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>Your Excellency is advised that one Thomas Figg has been tried at the late Term of the Jefferson Circuit Court on a charge of <hi rend="underline">Horse-stealing</hi>, and sentenced to the Penitentiary for the term of Five years. There were two Indictments vs- Figg. He was tried upon one and the other is on file against him.</p>
<p>The accused was born and reared in Louisville is upwards ^of^ thirty years of age, and no charge was ever proferred against him before. He has faithfully served a term of Three years in the Army (4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Cav.) and was honorably discharged, and reenlisted as a veteran and has served almost another year. and was in active service when this calamity befell him. He therefore pleads four years service in the cause of his country to induce your Excellency to listen to his apology for the situation in which he is now found -- </p>
<p>He was returning home from Bardstown on leave and got drunk at mount Washington, and was so drunk that he forgot all the proprieties of ^a^ Federal soldier and<pb/>
<lb/>"captured" two horses on the road in <hi rend="underline">daylight</hi>. He was immediately pursued and arrested at Louisville.</p>
<p>He acknowledges with sorrow the manifest wrong he perpetuated but insists that he was intoxicated and did not realise the nature of the crime.</p>
<p>He has a wife and two helpless children, without any means, and totally dependant on his exertions for a support. He prays a pardon, and if pardoned will forthwith rejoin his Regiment, serve his country to the best of his ability and be more careful in future to abstain from intoxicating drinks -- And will ever pray &amp;c -- </p>
<p>respectfully
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Thomas Figg</hi></p>
