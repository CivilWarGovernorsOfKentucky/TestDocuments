<lb/>Colonel,</p>
<p>Your favor of the <date when="1863-11-07">7<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> inst.</date> to the Governor, has been referred to this office.</p>
<p>I have the honor to state that your information as to the appointment of officers to your regiment -- whom you call outsiders, is incorrect -- none but M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Hynes have received such -- and you express yourself satisfied as to his appointment.</p>
<p>It was made on the General authority given by Maj. Geo. Welling to the Governor, to fill up such vacancies as occurred, with good men. It is the rule of this Department to act on the advice of the officer then in command, as to each regiment, and no considerations of what some other commanding officer may or may not do, will influence such action. The Governor exercises his prerogative of appointing, or declining to appoint those who are specially or generally recommended by the ranking officer then on the ground who is supposed to know best what his command requires.</p>
<p>In pursuance of that custo-<pb/>
<lb/><note place="header">282</note>
<lb/>to say that when official information reaches this Department, that the offices are vacant to which you recommend, the gentlemen's names will be considered by his Excellency, and if proper -- commissions will issue.</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Your obt. serv't
