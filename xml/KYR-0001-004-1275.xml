   <p>To his Excellency Govr. Bramlette -- </p>
<p>The undersigned Charles Laudenberger a citizen of Dover Mason County would respectfully represent to your Excellency, that he is a poor young man a foreigner by birth, just married, a blacksmith by trade, &amp; settled in Dover &amp; for the purpose of making a living he went to work at his trade, and his wife obtained from the town of Dover authority to sell beer. He states that some young gentlemen in Dover contrary to his consent and against his wishes played cards in the house where his wife sold beer. He endeavored to prevent them, but in his absence at his blacksmith shop, about 50 yards distant, these young men would engage in playing cards. He learns from his wife that she refused permission to the young men to play, but they would play in spite of her, bringing cards with them He trusts that in view of the circumstances, &amp; his inability to pay the fine of $200 which has just been inflicted upon him, at the <date when="1864-10">October term</date> of the Mason Circuit Court, that your Excellency will be pleased to remit so ^much^ of said fine as the constitution allows you.</p>
<p>State of Kentucky -- Mason County.</p>
<p>Charles Laudenberger says that the statements made in the foregoing petition are true.</p>

<p>We the undersigned jury who tried the indictment against Charles Laudenberger mentioned in his petition, state that we learned from the testimony that he is a very industrious, hardworking, sober, honest good citizen; but from the facts developed in the testimony against him by those who played in his house, we under the law were bound to find him guilty, and fixed the penalty at the lowest sum. We think his case is entitled to executive clemency.</p>

<p>We the undersigned citizens of Dover Ky know Charles Laudenberger, and state that he is an honest, industrious hardworking good citizen, and unable to pay the fine of $200 imposed upon him for allowing gaming in his house as stated in his petition</p>

<p>It was proven before the Jury that the petitioner was a poor man, and that he was an industrious and good citizen, I think his is a case that demands the interposition of the Executive</p>
