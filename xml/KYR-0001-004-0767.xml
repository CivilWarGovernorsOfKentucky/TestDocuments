   <p>Franklin Simpson County Ky.
<lb/><date when="1864-04">April <gap/> 1864</date>
<lb/>To his Excellency, The Governor of the State of Kentucky.</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Simpson County, respectfully represent, that at the <date when="1863-09">September term of the Simpson Equity &amp; Criminal Court, 1863</date>, John W. Roby was fined 100$ and his son Ezra Roby 50$ on Indictment for false imprisonment of the D. Sheriff,, in serving a Summons on the said J. W. Roby_. The proof in the case, was to some extent conflicting, <hi rend="str">S</hi> No one was present but the Deputy Sheriff Wade_ the two Robys and J. W. Robys wife_ and take the proof as made by Wade, he was imprisoned but a short time ^a few minutes^ in the upper room at J W. Robys house when he had gone to serve a Summons on Said Roby. Ezra Roby is a man of no means, in bad health, and dependent on his father for a support. J W. Roby is a man of some property, but hard run, and much pressed to pay his debts, and their conduct as <hi rend="str">Citizens</hi> has been uniformly that of peaceble quiet citizens.</p>
<p>We respectfully request your Excellency to remit Said fines or so much of them as is going to the state,</p>
