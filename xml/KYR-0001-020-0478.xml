<p>We the undersigned Citizens of Green county most respectfully state to your Excellency that <hi rend="underline">Wesley</hi> <hi rend="underline">Forbis</hi> some times Called William Wesley Forbis was as he States in his petition fined at the last <date when="1860-08">Augt Term of the Green Circuit Court 1860</date> -- the sum of $60 for the alledged Offense of Keeping a tippling house. We can state to your Excellency that we know this man Forbis he is our neighbor and acquaintance. he is a poor man very illitterate an easy inoffensive man. &amp; one who no one has ever had occasion to be offended with in his neighborhood or Elsewhere. We do not believe he is or has been guilty of the charge; he was in fact as we beleived ignorant of the charge against him and did not believe in reality that it was necessary to come to court to make any defence. and indeed made no defence &amp; was fined as above. his ignorance of the law and Entire want of capacity to attend to legal business, has been the cause of his being fined. he is very poor &amp; has a family to Support &amp; will necessarily have to lie in Jail to discharge said forfeiture as he has no means to pay said fine and the Effect of this will only be to deprive his family of his help &amp; tax the Commonwealth for his suport. we regard him as an object of Charity &amp; pity &amp; we respectfully ask your Excellency to remit said fine &amp; allow this poor man to remain with his family. and this will meet approval of all our citizens we verily believe all of which we respectfully Submit to your Excellency
