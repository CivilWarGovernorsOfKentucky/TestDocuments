<lb/>Hon B. Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I am at Caseyville on my way to the Mayfield Convention, At this place I met a <hi rend="underline">friend</hi> Mr Butler who was indicted in the Crittendent Circuit Court for assault &amp; Battery and at the last court in my absence was tried and fined $1250. I have been engaged as counsel in for defense, the Case was tried in my absence at Frankfort on business of state, am acquainted with the facts &amp; feel I can safely say it is a case that loudly Calles for executive Clemency. Mr Butler is a good and true man in every sence of the word and this verdict is an outrage upon humanity and in his name and in the name of his family I appeal<pb/>
<lb/>to you if Compatable with your official duty to release his fine except attys fee &amp; cost -- I am not in the habit of speaking so impolitic, as you know in cases ordinarily but this case is one of peculiar hardship &amp; an outrage on every principle of Justice. If in your opinion he deserves Executive Clemency</p>
<p>I will be placed under renewed obligations</p>
<p>I am yours truly
<lb/>Ben P Cissell<pb/></p>
<p>Hon B. Magoffin
<lb/>Frankfort.
<lb/>Ky.</p>
