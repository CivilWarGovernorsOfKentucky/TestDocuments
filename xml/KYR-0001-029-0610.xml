<p>Your petitioner would respectfully represent, that James Lloyd is now in confinement in the Penitentiary under charges of Rape, The Indictment was found and the conviction had in the Allen Circuit Court upon the testimony of a girl of bad reputation who has since turned out to be a public prostitute of the worst character, He was sentenced for ten years and has served now eight years of his time, The universal opinion among the citizens at the time of his conviction was that his sentence was obtained by perjury, The opinion of a vast majority of the people of Allen County is that he ought to be released as it would be an act of Justice to an innocent man, The Commonwealths attorny who prosecuted and the Judge who passed the sentence petitioned your predecessor Gov Morehead for his release. We believe his pardon would be an act of mercy and Justice and we pray your excellency to grant him pardon and a release from confinement,</p>
<p>J. W Hecter Rep Allen County
