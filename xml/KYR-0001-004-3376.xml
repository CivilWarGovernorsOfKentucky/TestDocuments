   <p>To his excellency Thomas E Bramlet
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners beg leave to state that one Daniel J Christian of Webster County was indicted by the Grand Jury of said County for the offence of Retailing Whiskey without a license and at the <date when="1864-03">March term of the Webster Circuit Court for 1864</date> Said Daniel J Christian was fined in the sum of Sixty dollars for said offence</p>
<p>We the undersigned Citizens of Webster County would respectfully represent to your Honor that said Christian is a very poor man that he is a cripple having lost his right thumb and with it the use of his right hand that he has a wife and four small children that we believe that the said Christian was actuated by no improper motive in selling whiskey but engaged in the same merely to enable himself the better to support his family wherefore We would respect fully petition your honor that he be released from the payment of said fine that the release would be an act of kindness to him but much more to his wife and infant children Wherefore We pray his release and as in duty will ever pray &amp;C</p>
