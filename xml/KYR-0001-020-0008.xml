   <p>To His Excellency, Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>We, the Jury men, who were tryers of Thomas. B. Wadlington, at the last term, of the Caldwell Circuit Court, on a charge of murder of M. A. Cartwright, in performance of our duty, with the evidence before us, and under the instructions of the Court, thought it our duty, to bring in a verdict of guilty of murder -- As Jurymen we performed our duty, as we conceived and now as <hi rend="underline">citizens</hi>, we appeal to you, in behalf of Thomas B. Wadlington, and request that you may extend Executive clemency to him -- We hope and trust, your Excellency will take into consideration all those facts and circumstances, which are proper to come before your Excellency, but of which, we as Judges of the Law &amp; facts could take no notice -- And we trust and desire, and ask that the unfortunate man, may receive of your hands a free and unconditional pardon or at least that his life may be spared &amp; his punishement commuted -- Respectfully -- <date when="1861-01">January 1861</date></p>
