   <p>State of Kentucky.
<lb/>Livingston County
<lb/>To His Excellency Hon. Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> E. Bramblette
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitions will state that they were members of the Petitt Jury who tried Joseph D. Jamison on a charge of permitting games at which property was bet, won &amp; lost to be played in a house under his control &amp;. upon which charge we found him guilty &amp; assessed his fine at Two Hundred Dollars which was done on the <date when="1865-08-17">17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of August 1865</date>, in the Circuit Court held for Livingston County a Copy of the Indictment is sent with this marked (No. 1)</p>
<p>The testimony against the defendant was substantially this M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Kinney stated that he had seen games played in house attached to &amp; adjoining the Store room of J. S, Hibbs in Birdsville; That where ever any playing was proposed Jameson would tell the parties that they should not bet; that on several occasions parties proposed to take a game in which conversations he remembered these words "boys let's take a game &amp; see who will treat" that at said times they would play &amp; at the end of the game the party who was beaten would sometimes treat. That nothing ws staked &amp; that these were the words used. That he did not remember whether any of these games were played after the first of <date when="1864-10">october 1864</date> &amp; that he would not be positive about it for his recollection did not serve<pb/>
<lb/>him.</p>
<p>Mr Lay stated that Hibbs &amp; Nelson had the house built in which the grocery or barroom was Kept that he sometimes said J. L. Hibbs in there controlling it &amp; selling liquors &amp; at one time he stated he beleives he would close up the room. That Hibbs Kept a tavern at Birdsville.</p>
<p>It was proven by the records that J. L. Hibbs on the <date when="1863-10-06">6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of octo. 1863</date> had got out a tavern license to Keep a tavern at Birdsville &amp; that deft. Jameson was sworn in as his Clerk to sell liquors.</p>
<p>Proof was introduced showing that s<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d.</hi></hi> Hibbs was the owner of the property.</p>
<p>This is substantially the evidence &amp; although it was not entirely clear that he should be fined yet from the instructions of the Court we could not do otherwise, we however think it is a case for Executive Clemency. Mr Jameson is a very young man &amp; very poor &amp; it would be a great hardship on him to pay the above amount. He is also a young man of good standing &amp; moral character as believe &amp; we petition &amp; earnestly request your Excellency to remit the fine believing as we do that if he violated the law it was through ignorance &amp; not with an evil intention.</p>
<p>Given under our hands this <date when="1865-08-18">18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of August 1865</date></p>
