<p>The evidence introduced by the Deft conduced to show that he had good grounds to believe that his person was in danger from one Elijah Adkins whose character for violence was prooven to be bad &amp; that there was a feud between Bowlin &amp; his father in Law on the one hand &amp; said Adkins on ther Your petitioners heard the cause tried one of the Jurors who tried it made an affidavit which was read on a motion for a new trial stating that the Jury had made their virdict by agreeing to a Magority</p>
<p>In the premises we ask that your Excellency will extend clemency to the Defendant by remitting the fine West Liberty Ky <date when="1865-11-25">Nov 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1865</date></p>

<p>Although the evidence was such as not to authorize me to set aside the verdict of the Jury yet it was such as to convince me that the carrying of the weapon was not unlawful under the circumstances I therefore hope that the fine will be remitted</p>
