  <body>
   <p>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin Governor of the state of Kentucky your petitioner Charles Mytinger s<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> respectfully states that at the <date when="1861-10">October Term of the Mason Circuit Court 1861</date> -- he was fined sixty dollars for keeping a Tippling-House in the city of Maysville: He has been for many years prior to his removal to Kentucky, a citizen of the state of Ohio, he is poor and in feeble, health and by the kindess and assistance of friends set up in a small grocery the profits of which he fears will be inadequate to his support; to two or more of his friends upon several Occasions he sold liquor and which acts he now learns were forbidden by the law = your Excellency has been pleased to remit or stay the collection of a fine imposed upon him by the Mayor of the City of Maysville for a similar offence; but the offence for which he was indicted and fined by the Circuit Court was committed before that tried by the Mayor; both were done by him in ignorance of the law<pb/>
<lb/>so soon as he learned by the admonition (of the trial) and judgment of the Mayor he desisted and so now remains = "Ignorance of the law excuseth no man", so say those who administer it, but it is he hopes a good reason for the exercize of mercy; his poverty and his ill health both unite in asking your Excellency to remit the said fine and prevent his becoming the feeble and helpless te<hi rend="str">i</hi>nant of a Jail, with the assurance that he will indeed in this matter at least "sin no more"</p>
<p>Charles Mytinger </p>
<p>we citizens of Maysville and mason County respectfully unite in the prayer of the foregoing petition.</p>
