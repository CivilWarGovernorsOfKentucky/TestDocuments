<lb/>Govenor Magoffin
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>The undersigned officers and members of the bar, of the Christian Circuit Court, would respectfully ask your Excellency to grant a full pardon to Johnathan Greer, who at the present term of the Christian Circuit Court has been found guilty of manslaughter, and his term of service in the state prison fixed by the jury at five years.</p>
<p>Without going into the details of the case as proven on the trial, we will only state that the proof, to say the least of it, showed mitigating circumstances sufficient to authorize the interposition of Executive Clemency; M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Greer is an old man, a husband, and a father, kind, affectionate, just and liberal in all the relations of life; and has always borne the character of a peacable, industrious good citizen; and we have no doubt was betrayed into the commission of the offence of which he has been found guilty, by his fatherly feelings for his sons, who at the time of the <unclear/> were engaged in a deadly conflict with the deceased -- we therefore think his case one that presents peculiar claims to your Excellency's most favourable consideration</p>
<p>Respectfully &amp;c
