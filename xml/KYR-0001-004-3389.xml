  <body>
   <p>To His Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette,
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky-</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Mercer County Ky. would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1864-11">November term 1864</date> for the Mercer Circuit Court Solomon Corn was convicted in a charge of larceny to two years confinement in the State penitentiary- He is a young man and before the charge brought against him on which he was found guilty he had been always regarded by all who know him, neighbors friends and acquaintances, as a young man of unexceptionable and exemplary character- Such was the testimony of the witnesses against him. For months before the trial, and almost ever since his arrest he had been confined in the jail of Franklin county, the Judge having removed the prisoners in the Mercer County Jail to Franklin Co. Jail for safe keeping and he was brought up from Frankfort during the term of the court and immediately placed upon his trial and none except the Commonwealth's witnesses being present. He confessed the crime as his first act being done while drunk and on a Chrismas Spree. He is a weak minded young man and very ignorant. His offence consisted<pb/>
<lb/>in taking some small articles of merchandise from a Store in <unclear/> Mercer Co. Ky. He is very poor and has a family dependent on him for support. We think his a case for executive clemency and respectfully petition the interposition of your Excellency in his behalf.</p>
