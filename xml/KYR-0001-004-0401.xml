<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Gov Bramlette
<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>You will recollect the case of Mr L. D. Cranniger, of this city who was the security of Capt Sharp who was indicted for <hi rend="underline">stealing</hi> a horse of one T. D. Kennedy. The horse was taken by Capt Sharp who was acting under Major Bocking who was acting under Col Leonidas Metcalf, who was acting under Genl Boyle. At one time Genl Boyle denied having authorised Col. Mitcalf and then the whole thing fell to pieces. You have doubtess seen the late letter of Col Metcalf<pb/></p>
<p>containing the very <unclear/> letter of Genl Boyle acknowledging that he had authorized Col Metcalf, but had forgotten it. When Bocking was stopped by the Order from Genl Boyle every thing fell in disaster, the sesesh every where were prosecuted Sharp -- there are now six cases preceding in this court. for transport to personal property arising out of this transaction. Col Carpenter put this in the form of felony so as to secure his attendance Sharp gave Mr Cranniger and getting frightened left. At the present term of the Kenton Circuit Court judgment was rendered against L. D. Cranniger for $200. Capt Sharp I understood is in Eaton Ohio <unclear/><pb/></p>
<p>low with bleeding of the lungs. I hope you will find it compatible with your duty as Governor to remit this fine immediately. If the Capt had remained I have no doubt he would have been cleared but being young he became frightened</p>
<p>Respectfully Yours
<lb/>John F. Fisk<pb/></p>
<p>Remit except costs &amp; fees
<lb/>Th E Bramlette</p>
