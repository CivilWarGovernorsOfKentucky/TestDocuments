   <p>To the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>I know Morton Scott who is indicted in the Jessamine Circuit Court for stealing mules. Young Scott is a gentleman of good standing until this unfortunate affair. He served in the army under your excellency. If any wrong have been done by him it was under the influence of bad men <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> and not any result of wrong principle in him.</p>
<p>He is recently married &amp; is now at work on a little farm in Indiana and though given at one time to the use of too much ardent spirits is now reformed as I learn I trust your excellency will pardon him before trial as I believe thereby public justice will not be hindered and yet a great good will be confer<hi rend="sup">d</hi> on a respectable family and on a young man just entering in to life</p>

<p>From statements made to me I believe the above to be true, and very heartily concur in the petition for the pardon of Morton <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> Scott</p>
