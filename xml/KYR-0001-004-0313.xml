   <p>To His Excellency Gov. Bramlette-</p>
<p>Your Petitioner William Forlen States that at the present <date when="--11">(Nov) Term</date> of the Jackson Circuit Court he was fined Fifty dollars for obtructing the Public highway.</p>
<p>He states that he was Surveyor of the road which runs through his land along the Rockcastle River and beleiving that he had the right as Surveyor to move the road on his own land he did set out his fence <hi rend="str">^out^</hi> and changed the road for a short distance. as the change was all on his own land and only a slight change he did not know that he was violating the law, He further says that he does not believe that the public has been injured by the change. The fine and costs will be oppressive to him as he is a poor man with a large family. He therefore respectfully petitions your Excellency to remit the fine</p>
