<p>The defendant then introduced W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> H. Bennett a sworn witness who stated that he knew Girty -- he (deft) resided in Newport &amp; did business in Cincinnati Ohio that he crossed the river late at night &amp; very early before day light in the morning in the ordinary course of his business. Here defts Attorney propounded to witness the following question "Are you acquainted with the passage back &amp; forth between Newport &amp; Cincinnati &amp; is there any reason to apprehend danger from violence or crime to a person crossing there in the night time? To which the Commonwealth objected and the objection was sustained by the Court to which deft excepted</p>

<p>Which was all the evidence for the defendant, The Attorney for the Commonwealth then moved the Court to instruct the Jury as to the law of the case whereupon the Court gave the following instructions to the Jury, viz:</p>
<p><note place="left margin">Plffs Instructions</note></p>

If the Jury believe that the defendant had at the time of carrying such weapon reasonable ground
<lb/><note place="left margin">8.</note><pb/>
<lb/>to believe that his person was in danger from violence or crime then they should find for the defendant.</p>
<p>2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> If the Jury have a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendant they must find for the defendant,</p>
<p>Which were excepted to by Defendant.</p>
<p>The defendant then moved the Court to instruct the Jury as follows.</p>
<p><note place="left margin">Defts Instruction</note></p>
<p>3.d. If the Jury believe from all the evidence that the Defendant was engaged in such lawful business as required him to travel at night and the carrying of a concealed weapon was necessary to enable the defendant to carry on his business then they will find him not guilty, which was refused by the Court to which the defendant excepted</p>
<p><note place="left margin">9.</note></p>
