<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Hon B Magoffin -- 
<lb/>Gov. State of Ky
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p><note place="left margin">Remitted
<lb/>B. M</note></p>
<p>On the <date when="1861-05-20">20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of May.</date> A certain town Police Judge By name. T. P. Young Rendered a decision against Me and in favor of the town for Eight Dollars and forty four cents.</p>
<p>The Case is this -- </p>
<p>On the night previous Several Students I being in the number were drilling and the night Watch. (Who are a set of theives) Saw us and did not like it, as the most of us are for the South and I from<pb/>
<lb/>one of the Confederate State (<hi rend="underline">Arks</hi>) <hi rend="underline">Which they</hi> <hi rend="underline">know</hi> and did not for this reason like our movements. And here let me add -- that a feeling of <hi rend="underline">no</hi> strong friendship is now and has been for sometime existing between the Republican Mechanical Association of this place, on the one hand And the Students on the other. And the wherefore is that on a certain day Some months since the Students March under a Students March under a Southern Flag and a few wanted ^to^ take it away from them and a fight was expected a few citizens interfered and Saved a few Lincoln Souls ^were saved^ from being sent to H -- ll But Excuse this wandering -- </p>
<p>The night watch who informed on me stated, at least in the writ that I whooped and<pb/>
<lb/>hollowed, thereby disturbing the peace of the City.</p>
<p>Now when the hour for trial came and the <hi rend="underline">Dishonorable</hi> Night Watch came to be sworn. He would not swear that I whooped and hollowed. But that -- I <hi rend="underline">made</hi> a <hi rend="underline">no</hi>ise here a question arose -- When asked several time by my Lawyer whether he would say that I whooped &amp; hollowed he gave and would give no answer -- then <hi rend="underline">Chief</hi> <hi rend="underline">Justice</hi> Young told him ^he^ would have to answer that Question as it was fair and legal. Still he would not. then a move -- was made by my Lawyer to dismiss the case. the Judge said no -- proceed. Was this Justice!- Supposing that You know Col Tom P. <hi rend="underline">Young</hi> or have heard of him. I<pb/>
<lb/>will say But little of him When my turn came I had four or five Wittnesses who upon oath -- stated that they were with me all the time -- that I neither whooped hollowed nor made any noise of any kind Yet after all this this noted Judge seems bent on stealing some money from me and others if possible -- and by the way it took him three or four days to give a Decision and when given was against me. My Lawyer said he would give no Decision as it was too plain a case in my favor -- Your Son knows about this -- A students hollowed for Jeff Davis the other night and was fined for it. Justice oh Justice Does Tom Young Know you</p>
<p>This is to ask of you to Remit if possible this unjust fine -- </p>
<p>Very Respt. } F. D. Denton</p>
