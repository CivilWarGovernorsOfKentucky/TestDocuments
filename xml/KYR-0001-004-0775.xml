   <p>I was Mayor of the city of New Port and held the examining court at which Philip Kennedy and Patrick White were tried for &amp; rape committed upon the person of Elizabeth Franklin. She swore that one of them men had two connections forcibly with her within a very short time, while the other stood by and did not have any connection with her at all. The attorney for the Defendants commented upon her testimony to show that it was incredible that a man to could have two connections with a woman in so short a time and I cannot be mistaken in my recollection of her statement.</p>
