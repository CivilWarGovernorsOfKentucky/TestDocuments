<lb/>Carter County SS </p>
<p>To His Excellency Thomas E Bramlett Governor of Ky We the undersigned petitioners would respectfully represent to your Excellency that Lewis Galion Esqr was fined before John Z Montgomery Esqr the Sum of $20, for a breach of the peace in the way of a <hi rend="str">breach</hi>riot Now the case is this Mr Galion was presant when a fus commenced and he pressed in a mong them to try to make peace, and the matter turned out so that he got into the fus himself but he did it a trying to make peace he did not rase any disturbance himself but he had to do what he did for self defence although he was fined it is the first time he ever was in such a thing and he is a peaceable man; and a poor man with a family to school and maintain and we have had so much bad luck by being robed it seems that if Mr Galion should have to pay said fine he will not be able to do his family Justice; in suporting them now for these reasons we petition your excellency to extend your Kind hand to the distressed man and remit Said fine &amp; for such relief we shall ever pray</p>
