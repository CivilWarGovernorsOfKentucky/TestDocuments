<p>Your petitioner James Gormley Respectfully ^represents^ to Your Excellency that He is a loyal adopted Citizen of the United States of America that He is true and faithfull to the Government of the United States and that He has done eveything in His power to sustain it. He States farther to Your Excellency that He has a large family and has no other means to support them but His own industry. He Your petitioners is the owner of a mare which He used in conveying articles to <hi rend="underline">Camp</hi> <hi rend="underline">Nelson</hi> to sell to the soldiers there that this mare was taken or strayed away that it was found in the possession of one Travis who when found out fetched the mare to Your petitioners House and endeavoured to extort a reward from Your petitioner that Your petitioner got possession of his mare and that Travis endeavoured to take the mare away in order to extort a high reward Your petitioner asked him to wait a little while untill Mr Croughan would come and your petitioner would pay him what was right<pb/>
<lb/>but He still refused to wait and tried to take the mare away and steal your petitioner ^Your petitioner^ defended Himself as He had a right to do Travis send out a warrant against Your petitioner in the Lexington City Court the principal Testimony being Travis' own oath Your petitioner was fined ($30 -- ) thirty dollars Your petitioner respectfully asks Your Honour to remit said fine and Your petitioners will ever pray Your Honors health and hapiness</p>
<p>Jas. Gormley</p>
<p>We the under signed in view of the forgoing statement of facts respectfully <hi rend="underline">ask</hi> Your Hour to remit the above fine of thirty dollars</p>
<p>I believe that the foregoing facts are true and would consider a remission just and proper.</p>
<p>G Robertson
<lb/>D Bell
<lb/>Jno B Wilgers</p>
<p>Governor,</p>
<p>I am not personally acquainted with either of the above named parties I have enquired as to the standing and loyalty of both. Mr Formley is a good Union man and a law abiding citizen. I know nothing of the politics of Travis, I understand he is a low bred fellow. I believe from all I can learn, that the above is correct</p>
