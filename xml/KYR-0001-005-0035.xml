<lb/>Dear Sir -- </p>
<p>You have as I understand been informed by the Jailor of this County of the escape from Jail of <hi rend="str">Thomas</hi> Edward Maddox on the <gap/> day of <gap/> last, and thinking perhaps it my duty as County Judge to officially inform you of the fact in order that a reward may be offered for his arrest -- </p>
<p>He was charged with killing W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> A Brothers of this County and was tried before an examining Court and refused bail and was consequently Confined in Jail, A party of lawless men came into town in the night and broke the Jail door open and took him out -- I am satisfied if a suitable reward was offered, he would be arrested,</p>
<p>He is about 5 feet 8 inches high, light complected, dark hair, about 45 or 50 years of age -- </p>
<p>I understand that he is now in Capt Bells Company, 11<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky Cavalry -- <pb/>
<lb/>stationed at Halls Gap -- </p>
<p>Respectfully --
