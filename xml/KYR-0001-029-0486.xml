<lb/>Hon J F Robinson
<lb/>Dear Govenor</p>
<p>At the <date when="1861-03">March term 1861</date> of the Madison Circuit Court I was indicted for wearing concealed weapons. I did warn them At that time the whole country was excited. I was away from home &amp; in the midst of excited political &amp; personal enemies &amp; every body almost wore arms. Goodloe cannot sit in the case &amp; it will have to be removed on a Judge appointed. Under these circumstances I hope you will pardon the offense<pb/>
<lb/>before trial as I do not wish to be annoyed with it or to follow it elsewhere I can easily have a state of ease that will escuse me under the law</p>
<p>If it is not asking too much please enclose me a remission for the offense &amp; oblige your friend</p>
<p>Thos. Turner</p>
<p>The indictment was suspended by Goodloes indignity &amp; calling the attention of this sheriff to the fact when <unclear/> &amp; very often man in the court house on weapons none of them were indicted</p>
