<lb/>To His Excellency Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioners, citizens of Woodford county, very respectfully represent, that on the <date when="1864-11-12">12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of Nov. 1864,</date> W C Hall a citizen of said county entered as bail in the Jefferson circuit court in a recognizance for Six hundred Dollars for the appearance of his son Thos S Hall in that court charged with the offence of Larceny <hi rend="str">or having been committed in Woodford county</hi>; that at a subsequent term of said court said bond was forfeited, The accused not having surrendered himself in accordance with its requirements, and summons has now issued on the recognizance against W C Hall, The bail, returnable to the <date when="1865-05">1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> day of the May</date> term of said court; They state further that W C Hall is a very poor man with a family which he has to support by his daily labor -- he is a quiet industrious citizen -- and is not able to pay the amount of the forfeiture ^as They believe.^ They understand that he has lost about $400.<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> worth of property since executing said bond. They believe that his is a just and proper case for the interposition of executive clemency -- </p>
<p>They therefore, very respectfully, and earnestly,<pb/>
<lb/>petition your excellency to remit the forfeiture of said recognizance as to W C Hall the bail -- </p>
