   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thomas. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Gov of the Comm of Ky</p>
<p>Your Pettitioner W. B. Hoke, says that in the <date when="1863">Summer of 1863</date>- George Kenniston and Robert Johnston were ^keepers of a^ Coffee house in Louisville Ky. That they were indicted for allowing gambling in their house, and by the Judge of the Police Court held to bail in the sum of Three Hundred dollars. He says that he knew the men, and believed them not guilty of knowingly allowing Card playing for money in their house. He says they were poor men and were kept in Jail some three or four days before he consented to bail them, and that one of them was in bad health and spitting blood whilst in Jail. He says that one of them a short while before he went into the liquor business was a te^a^mster near Nashville Tenn, owning his wagon and four horses and that these (<hi rend="underline">his all</hi>) were taken by John Morgan. This petitioner says that after he went these parties bail, <hi rend="underline">they</hi> <hi rend="underline">made</hi> <hi rend="underline">several</hi> <hi rend="underline">appearances</hi> <hi rend="underline">in</hi> <hi rend="underline">the</hi> <hi rend="underline">Court</hi> <hi rend="str">and</hi> with their witnesses ready for trial. That <hi rend="underline">the</hi> <hi rend="underline">Commonwealth</hi> <hi rend="underline">continued</hi> <hi rend="underline">the</hi> <hi rend="underline">case</hi> <hi rend="underline">except</hi> the last time when the<hi rend="str">ir</hi> witnesses for Defts had Scattered and gone. He says that one of the Defts had obtained employment upon<pb/>
<lb/>a Government vessel and that it was with great trouble that he got the consent of the officers of said vessel to leave and make his appearance in Court. He says after so many continuances and the appearance<hi rend="str">s</hi> of Defts. they could not get a trial, and have got away from this locality and the bail has been forfeited. He says that after one of the parties had left. he Telegraphed here from St Louis Mo, stating that he could not leave the Boat. and again he wrote from Paducah Ky Stateing their boat was there and his officers would not give him leave of absence. Since this he has not heard from either of them. He says they did not intentionally forfeit their Bail, and if here he believes they would have been acquitted.</p>
<p>This Petitioner says that he has paid the amount going to the prosecuting Attorney, and that the payment of the balance is a hard case. as the accused, could not help the forfeiture, as he believes</p>
<p>Wherefore he prays that your excellency will remit the forfeiture, and as in duty bound he will ever pray.</p>
<p>Respectfully Your obed Servant
<lb/><hi rend="underline">W. B. Hoke</hi></p>
<p>Remit except fees &amp; costs
<lb/><hi rend="str">Refused</hi>
<lb/>Thos E Bramlette</p>
