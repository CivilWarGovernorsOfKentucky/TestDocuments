   <p>To His Excellency Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E. Bramlet Governor of the State of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned petitioners citizens of Boone County represent that of the <date when="1865-08">august Election in 1865</date> James McFullitone &amp; M R Johnson were Judges, of said election at the Bigham Precinct in said county that said judges refused to allow John Doyle Geo M McManamo &amp; James Murphy ^to vote^ on the ground that they were not citizens under the act of expatriation of <date when="1862-03">March 1862</date> and that said judges were for said refusal to allow then said Doyle, McManamo Murphy ^to vote^ indicted by the Grand Jury of said County at the <date when="1865-09">Spt Term 1865</date></p>
<p>In the case of Murphy the only one of those cases tried there was a hung Jury</p>
<p>They believe that <unclear/> to the feelings on the just of those in sympathy with the rebellion toward a union man and especially towards union men who have acted as offices of elections it is not probable that the cases can he disposed of or that justice will be done towards any of said offices</p>
<p>They therefore believe these cases present a case for executive interposition &amp; ask your Excellency to interpose &amp; release the said Judge who they beleave acted consciensiously in the discharge of their duty from the effects of said Indictements</p>
<p>They further state that said Judges together with Lt Thos J M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Hattan of the 55th Ky request <unclear/> also indicted <hi rend="str">the two judges</hi> for ordering<pb/>
<lb/>the erasure of the name of John N Gunerly who had offered to note &amp; whose name was made but no <unclear/> <unclear/> the note therefore not counted because of the <unclear/> to swear when requested by the judges</p>
<p>For the reasons herein before named <unclear>the</unclear> <unclear/> asked of said judges &amp; M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Hattan be also endorsed &amp; the endorsement <unclear/></p>
