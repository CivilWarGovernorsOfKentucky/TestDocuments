<lb/><date when="1863-10-28">Oct 28. 1863</date>
<lb/>His Excellency Gov. Bramblette
<lb/>Frankfort
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed I send you a petition for the remission of a fine ag Gramer signed by all of the Jurors to whom the same was presented as I understand and also signed by the Mayor &amp; Trustees of his town. He is a poor ignorant German and I think was misled by a license which he held from the Council of Jamestown. I believe if you remit the fine (&amp; he will still have to pay all costs including the amt to the comlths atto.) that the public interests will be subserved &amp; I am sure he will "sin no more"</p>
<p>Most Respy.
