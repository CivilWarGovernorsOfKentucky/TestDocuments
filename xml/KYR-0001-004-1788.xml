   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E Bramblett
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioners A. N. English and John Hill would most respectfully state to your Excelency that at <date when="1865-04">April term of the Cumberland ^Circuit^ Court 1865</date> Judgment was rendered against them in favor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky for Sixty dollars each when a Joint indictment found against them a the <date when="1864-10">October term of said Court 186<hi rend="str">5</hi>4</date> for keeping a Tipling house in Cumberland County Ky. Without any denial of their legal guilt they state the following facts in extenuation of said offence and upon which they base their claim and grounds for your Excelency'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> interposition and for which reasons they humbly ask that s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> fine be remitted (Viz)</p>
<p>They come to Burksville in <date when="1863">186<hi rend="str">1</hi>3</date> to trade in Groceries and dry goods on a small scale as a means of obtaining and making an honest living not being able to make &amp; keep any thing raised upon the farm and without any intention to violate or run counter to the Laws either of the Federal or state Government they rented a house paid the Government Tax and made application for license but failed to procure them as the Trustees of Burksville who alone had the power to grant License to vend spiritous Liquors<pb/>
<lb/>had not on account of the distrurbed condition of the Country been reelected nor had any sucessor to them been elected and the office of trustees being vacant they were unable to procure License They did all in their power to get License as they desired to Comply with the Laws. they were informed and beleaved that in as much as there were no Trustees they had a right to go, ahead to sell so they procured as they intended License as soon as there were ^any^ one authorized to grant them they found other Groceries in operation in Town without License &amp; beleaved they could go a head and sell Liquors with out acting in bad faith either to the Authorities or people and did so. they were informed and belieaved that the License from the Government was sufficient especially as there were none or but very few Civil officers in the County and were governed by military Law, or of Armies -- They are poor &amp; used their little mite to live on. They as soon as the Civil authority was restored and they learned that it was unlawfull to sell spiritous Liquors without License although no person or power was authorised to grant them abandoned the traffic &amp; are now following other business (Viz, merchandising) wherefore they ask<pb/>
<lb/>that that portion of said fine going to the Commonwealth be remitted and as in duty bound will ever pray.</p>
<p>A N English &amp; John Hill say that they have read the foregoing petition and the facts therein stated are true</p>
