   <p>Covington <date when="1861-08-26">Aug. 26. 1861.</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>B Magoffin.
<lb/>Governer of Kentucky:
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>I have never had the honor of becoming personally acquainted with you, but you will perhaps remember me as one of the secretaries of the Breckenridge Convention at Frankfort, and Editor, while it existed, of the Kenton County Democrat.</p>
<p>The Bearer of this note is L Roche, known to me for some years and who I can endorse as a very respectable citizen. While proprietor of a Grocery he was led by indulgence to his friends to retail liquor for which he was indicted<pb/>
<lb/>and fined. He has been out of business lately, but has an opportunity of procuring employment if he is relieved of the pressure of his fine. I need hardly say that very few of us could pay at the present time a $60 fine.</p>
<p>His Petition is signed by Mayor Goodson, Judge Mooar of the County Court, Major H C Harris and others known to you.</p>
<p>I warmly recommend the prayer of his Petition and will be highly pleased to learn of it favorable reception.</p>
<p>Mr Roche is a man of much more intelligence than his appearance indicates, and acted for some time as a school Trustee. Allow me<pb/>
<lb/>to sign myself</p>
<p>Your obt Servant
<lb/>John. P. Harrison</p>
