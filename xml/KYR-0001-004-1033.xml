   <p>At the last term of the Ohio Circuit Court, Six judgments were obtained in favor of the Comlth. against a man by the name of Jonathan Railey -- One for $150 -- two for $100 each -- and three for $25 each -- </p>
<p>I have agreed to take of Mr Railey less than what the law allows to me of these judgments -- He has paid me some money (which he says was loaned to him by his Father, and which I believe to be true) and the balance he has secrued by note with his Father as his surety -- </p>
<p>The Sheriff (his neighbor) informs me that he has a large family, and that he is a very poor man, and this, I believe, to be true -- </p>
<p>Since I have been Comlth's Atty., I have not prepared a Petition to his Excellency asking that any one should be released of a fine, because, I have doubted the propriety -- I have signed, it it is true, One or two Petitions, asking that fines should be remitted, but the judgments<pb/>
<lb/>for these were obtained before I became Comlth's Atty. -- And this I intend, merely as a statement of facts, &amp; made at the request of Railey -- And because, he seems not very well able to employ any one to prepare him a Petition -- </p>

<p>At the last term of this Court three judgments were obtained against James W. Daniel -- One for $150 -- and two for $75 each -- </p>
<p>And what I have said of Railey would also apply to him -- </p>
