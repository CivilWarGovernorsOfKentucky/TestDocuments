<lb/>Governor Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>C M Mathews Esq of Henry County, a gentleman of high character and a lawyer of many years practice was here yesterday, with the view of asking a remission of a judgment on forfeited recognizance which had been rendered against him at the last term of the Henry Circuit Court for $750. His papers were not complete, and has returned home with instructions to establish by affidavits some facts which will, I am satisfied, present a good case for relief. Execution is out and is returnable the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst.</p>
<p>The object of this note is to submit the enclosed paper showing some, but not all, the facts of his case, with the view of obtaining a respite of the judgment for three or six months.</p>
<p>He will be able to show, by the statements of others the truth of the matters in his statement herewith sent, and in addition 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> that he, during a long practice, has never become the surety of any one under criminal charge on indictment, 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> That<pb/>
<lb/>went twice himself and sent his son a third time, to the former residence of Myers to get him to appear for trial. 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> that Myers did appear at the first term he was indicted, pressed for a trial, but could not get it, because of the adjournment of the Court 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> That he for a time he stated to going bail and reluctantly yielded to the importunities of Myers wife &amp; children and the suggestion and pursuasion of the Com th's Attorney. 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> He has heard since the bail was forfeited that Myers has been dead for some time and the Clerk of the County of Myers ^former^ residence informs him that he was dead a short while after bail was given and before the appearance term.</p>
<p>He will make every effort to find out Myers residence if alive, and in good faith endeavor to secure his presence to answer the <hi rend="str">charge</hi> the indictment.</p>
<p>Having known Mathews I am satisfied of his entire innocence of any complicity in any attempt to <unclear/> the court and I believe he will be able,<pb/>
<lb/>as he assures me, to make good all the statements here and in his petition made.</p>
<p>He is a poor man, with a large family.</p>
<p>For him I respectfully ask for a respite of the judgement, in order to afford an opportunity for a full &amp; fair presentation of his case</p>
<p>Very respectfully
