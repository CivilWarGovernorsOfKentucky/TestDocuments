<lb/>To His Exc<hi rend="sup">l</hi> B. Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I have been shown this morning by Col. R. H Stanton The accompanying petition addressed to your Excellency in favour of Pardon for H C Helvestine and a request that I state my opinion of the character of the Signers to same. I have carefully examed the same, and state. They are all or nearly all personal known to me. and known to be good citizens of Fleming County. And of the Helleborn District. and they are such citizens as are entitled to high consideration Allow me again to call your Excellencys attention to a written statment on file in your office Made in <date when="1861-05">May</date> By Doct Logan H B Dobyns Eq &amp; myself and again Solicit your Excelleny to restore this man H C Helvestine to His family</p>
<p>Your friend
<lb/>L W Andrews</p>
<p>I unite in the above request of Mr Andrews and of the signers to the petition, because I sincerely believe Helvestine ought to be released. He has given important information to the State, the effect of which has been to break up a long exciting system of operations in counterfeit money in Fleming County and the neighborhood; and I have no doubt that Helvestine when convicted, had been but a short time connected with the counterfeiters, and was not hardened in crime, I also want to use him as a witness against others.</p>
<p>R H Stanton 
<lb/>Atty for Comwth.</p>
