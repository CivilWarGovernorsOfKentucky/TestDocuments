<lb/>My Dear Sir</p>
<p>I write to request you to perform funeral service over the body of my lamented friend and Father-in-law at your church in Georgetown ^<date when="1862-04-18">tomorrow</date> at 11 oclock^ The reason of my late application will be explained to you by my friend who hands you this and I know will be appreciated by you.</p>
<p>I know the task will be an embarassing one to you but I feel that you will not let the body of such <unclear/> go begging the rites of Christian burial.</p>
<p>George W. Johnson was born in this county on the spot where Junius R Ward's house stands.<date when="1811-05-27">May 27 1811</date>. He died as we can best learn on Wednesday <date when="1862-04-09">April 9</date> but having been mortally wounded on the <date when="1862-04-07">7<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date>. I know through a Confederate prisoner that he saw him fall. That he was on Breckenridges staff till a short time before his wound. When his horse being killed under him (not the day before) he immediately fell into the ranks with a gun<pb/>
<lb/>and was in a short time wounded.</p>
<p>Judge Duvall &amp; Paul Rankin can give you any incidents in his life and character you desire.</p>
<p>A brief discourse only will suffice though should you act I shall leave everything in regard to it entirely to your own judgement.</p>
<p>I shall be in town by 9 oclock and I hope I will not be disappointed in my expectations</p>
<p>Pardon this hurried note and believe me</p>
<p>Very truly Yours &amp;c
<lb/>J Stoddard Johnston<pb/></p>
