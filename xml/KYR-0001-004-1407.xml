<lb/>J. H. Price Esq,, Atty at Law
<lb/>Sir.</p>
<p>You will I hope pardon this liberty in trespassing on your valuable time, but as I have no chance to see any,,body here in reference about a Petition to His Excellency Gov Bramlett, I therefore seat myself and converse with you through the silent medium of the Pen.</p>
<p>For God sake my dear Sir see M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Robert Elliott or M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> E<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> Craig and ask them, if you have not got the time to spare to draw up a Petition beg them for the Mercy of the almighty not to refuse me, but to save me from utter ruin and disgrace it is the only hope left for me, I have written to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Elliott but not Knowing whether he received Note<pb/>
<lb/>or not, you will I trust and pray not refuse me this favor, and God, the God of Justice, who Knows our very hearts within, our past present and our future, is my witness that should I succeed in getting released from this awfull doom I shall never forgett your Kindness and shall see that you are amply paid for your trouble, and for the many Kindness you have shown me, my heart is honest in what I am saying I swear it before God, as the time is now drawing close and we may be sent up to the Penitentiary any day for the love of God delay not, but help me in this hour of trouble.</p>
<p>Please go and see M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Robert Elliott on receipt of this, show him this litter, oh dear<pb/></p>
<p>Sir my Pen nor tongue can express how I feel, could you but feel the pangs of my heart you would ^not^ refuse, and as my Prosecuter M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walker and also M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Smith have promised to sign my Petition and I trust the members of the Jury on my case will not refuse, Mrss John Snyder, A Bowie, Hemming and others, I cannot recollect where on the Jury</p>
<p>Hoping and trusting to God that you will attend to this imediately and may God bless you in all your undertaking and assist me in this hour of trouble, I beg leave to sign myself</p>
<p>Very Humbly &amp; Respectfully
