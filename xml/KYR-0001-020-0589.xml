   <p>State of Kentucky
<lb/>Harrison County,</p>
<p>The affidavit of Robert H Collier who says that in the <date when="1856">summer of 1856</date>, he had a fuss with a man named Doubman -- and was by him Bound over to keep the Peace. He entered into a Bond with Peter H Peterson as his surety. He says that previous to the next term of the Nicholas Circuit Court, he and Doubman made friends and said Doubman agreed that he would not appear against him, and affiant then thought it would not be necessary for him to appear, as the whole matter was compromised and the prosecution did not appear, owing however to the non appearance of Affiant -- a Judgment was taken in the name of the Commonwealth against him and his security -- In consideration of these facts. He respectfully prays your Excellency for a remission of said Judgment except fees and costs, and as in duty bound will ever pray &amp;c</p>
