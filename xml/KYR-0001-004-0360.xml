  <body>
   <p>To his excellency the Governor of the Comwth of Ky</p>
<p>The undersigned your petitioners citizens of Carroll County would respectfully state that at the <date when="1861">Spring term 1861</date> of the Carroll Circuit Court William Gardner was fined $50 for selling Liquor to a minor.</p>
<p>Gardner states that at the time the offense was committed he was ignorant of the existence of a law prohibiting such sales.</p>
<p>Your petitioners further state that Gardner is a man of limited means. That he has a family wholly dependent upon him for support. We state that since the fine was assesed Gardner has conducted himself as a law abiding citizen and we have reason to believe he will so conduct himself in the future.</p>
<p>We therefore request your excellency to remit said fine</p>
<p>William Gardner.
