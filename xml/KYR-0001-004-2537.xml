   <p>To his Excellency Govr Thomas E Bramlette</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of the County of Bath State of Ky would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1865-09">Sept Term 1865</date> of the Bath Circuit Court Joshua Craig was fined the sum of $60 for Keeping a tippling House. We are well acquainted with the said Joshua Craig, and Know that he has a large family, who are dependant wholy upon his labor for a livelihood and it would be an act of injustice to his children to take that amount from them, as they will be the sufferers at last. We are satisfied that the said Joshua Craig will sin in that way no more, and we ask Executive clemency, in his favor to the extent of remitting said fine=</p>
