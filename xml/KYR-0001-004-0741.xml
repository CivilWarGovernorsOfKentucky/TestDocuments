   <p>To his Excellency Thos E Bramlette, Governor of the State of Kentucky;</p>
<p>Your Petitioner would most humbly and respectfully State and Say that at the <date when="1863-06">June 1863 term of the Franklin Circuit Court</date> he was fined in the Sum of $60, Sixty Dollars upon the charge of selling Whiskey without license, contrary to the laws of this State, Your petitioner would and does most solemly aver that he was at the time of the trial of said ^charge^ confined to his bed at home suffering as he then believed with his death illness) severe Heamorage from the lungs (and from which he has never yet entirely recovered) &amp; that he was therefore proceeded against &amp; fined without being able to be present or attempt to make a defense which he believe he could have done but for illness, as your petitioner is a feeble though candid man he would further state and say that he did at several barbacues Sell Blackberry wine of his own manufacture which he believed he had a right to do; but he does positively state that on no occassion did he vend ardent spirits as charged</p>
<p>Therefore your Petitioner throws himself into the arms of Executive clemency and asks that said fine be remited he is a poor man, in feeble health, a large family entirely dependent on him for support_ and that he is unable to pay said fine without great privation to his wife &amp; children.</p>
