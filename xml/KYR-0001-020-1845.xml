<p>We the undersigned Citizens of Newport would respectfully make Known to your Excellency that on the <gap/> day of <date when="1862-04">April 1862</date>, George Stricker, was brought before the Mayor of the City of Newport, on charge of a breach of the peace, and was fined by said Mayor the sum of Thirty Dollars. Mr. Stricker is a young man who has always conducted himself with propriety, and is of good moral character and industrious habits, and is dependent entirely upon his own labour we are of opinion that the fine was exorbitant and not warranted under the proof therefore we would pray your excellency to interpose the Executive clemency in his behalf as we consider his case a deserving one
