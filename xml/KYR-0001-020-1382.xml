   <p>To his excellency Beririar M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin Govenor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned Your humble Petitioners would respectfully represent unto your honor that Akillus Combs <hi rend="str">of</hi>was Indited by the Grand Jury of Morgan County at its <date when="1859-12">December term 1859</date> &amp; fined at its <date when="1861-06">June</date> term next ensuing the sum of Fifty Dollars Said inditement was found for the offence of unlawfully selling or giving to the slave of an other spiritous Liquors The facts of the case are these, said Combs met a favorite black boy of the country belonging to Mr George M. Hampton in the town of West Liberty &amp; not Knowing or thinking that it was contrary to the statute Law of the state, bought his whiskey &amp; treated said slave the said Hampton being a particular friend of said Combs, <hi rend="str">h</hi>as your peitioners verily believe without knowledge of the statute prohibiting the same &amp; without intention off offence to the law or the citizens</p>
<p>Now the said Combs being a poor man, and <hi rend="str">execution issued against him, &amp;</hi> ^and was required to replevey the same in court^ he was about to be imprisoned for the same being unable to pay it said Hampton together with Clinton Combs ^his brother^ releveyed said fine, which replevey is now near out; and owing to the distracted condition of the country said Akillus or his brother are unable to pay said fine without greatly distressing each of them</p>
<p>Now your petitions would pray that believing as they do that no offence was intended by said Combs &amp; that no injury was done to the owner of said slave; but that had he been consulted full consent would have been given by him to Combs to treat his boy; &amp; that no citizen was disturbed, that you remit said fine, that said Combs &amp; his security be forever released from the same believing as we do that it would be an act of lenity upon the part of our executive, and that it would meet the approbations of Good citizen Generally<pb/></p>
<p>Sworn to by Clinton Combs before me this <date when="1861-09">September 1861</date></p>
