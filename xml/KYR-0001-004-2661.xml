<p>Be it remembered that upon the trial of this prosecution, John W. Dearing was called as a witness who being sworn testified as follows on the last day of <date when="1860-02">February 1860</date> witness missed from his money drawer some money witness was a merchant residing at Paradise in Muhlenberg County Ky on the night the money was taken the accused William Kirtley was at witness Store with D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> King John Abbott &amp; others, We were in the back room near the stove playing a game for amusement, Kirtley went out was absent 15 or 20 minutes &amp; returned this was between seven &amp; eight oclock P M, The front door of the store was open and no light in the front room, The Company dispersed about the same time, soon after they left witness found his money drawer open &amp; missed therefrom $45 in bills one twenty dollar bill on the Southern Bank of Kentucky one Ten dollar bill on the Commer<hi rend="str">s</hi>cial Bk and three five dollar bills he thinks on the Bank of Louisville. Witness was in the Store that night before the money was taken but does not remember that he left the money drawer open but it was not locked. It could have been open without going behind the Counter by getting on the Counter. he was in the habit of leaving his<pb/>
<lb/><note place="left margin">6.</note>
<lb/>front door open in the early part of the night some times had a light in their &amp; some times none, That night there was no light in front room Witness tod some persons that night of his loss, but did not tell Kirtley and said but little about it to any one, In three or four days after the loss of the money, William Kirtley returned to witness a Twenty dollar bill a ten dollar bill and two five dollar bills and four dollars in change &amp; soon after sent one dollar by his brother Kirtley lived at that time in Paradise, 200 yards from Witness Store, not long after this occurred Kirtley left Paradise &amp; was off teaching school He was also in the army as witness understood. His father lived in Paradise &amp; he has been there often since &amp; staid weeks &amp; perhaps months at a time.</p>
<p>Being Cross examined Witness stated that when Kirtley returned the money he told witness that the drawer was open &amp; that he took the money in order to caution him against carelessness intending to return it, that he had told his wife what he had done that he had got Charles Sely to change one of the five dollar bills that he had the money at his house &amp; would go &amp; bring it, which he did in a few minutes. The accused had been intimate with witness, much about his store &amp; may sometimes have waited on his customers but he does not recollect distinctly as to this.<pb/></p>
<p><note place="left margin">7</note>
<lb/>Witness had never accused Kirtley of taking the money before it was returned. He had stated in his presence the day after its loss, that he had lost the money from his vest pocket and Kirtley said it was a serious loss. On the night the money was returned Kirtley was in witness back room when Charles Sely came into the front room &amp; showed witness a five dollar bill which he said he got from Kirtley. Sely bought some candles and left, Kirtley then asked witness to step out with him. They went out of the house to themselves &amp; Kirtley told him about having taken the money as before stated &amp; returned it to him in a few minutes thereafter. Kirtley has been in the habit of staying about Witness Store since when in Paradise. Kirtley had a wife who staid at his father's while he was absent in the Army.</p>
<p>King being also called as a witness for the Commonwealth stated, that he was in Dearing's store the night his money was said to have been taken W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Kirtley &amp; several other persons were there in back room. Think the front door was open &amp; the door between the back &amp; front room also The middle door was so situated that a person sitting by store in back room could not see one coming in at the front door, About 7 or 8 oclock Kirtley went out &amp; returned in a few minutes, Three or four days after this he saw Charles Sely go<pb/>
<lb/><note place="left margin">8.</note>
<lb/>into Dearing's Store &amp; show him a five dollar bill. They held a conversation in a low tone Kirtely was in back room when Sely went in &amp; witness thinks might have heard a part of what was said by Sely this was in day time. Kirtley has been absent from Paradise most of the time since, Witness heard he was teaching a school some where &amp; that he was in the army but never saw him in the army nor with uniform on he has often been in and around Paradise since &amp; staid perhaps weeks at a time &amp; was there when he was arrested this fall</p>
<p>Charles Sely being called as a witness for the Commonwealth stated that two or three days after he had heard ^that^ Dearing had lost money Kirtley came to his house in Paradise bought some beer and gave him a five dollar bill for which he gave him the change. Witness took the bill that night to Dearing store &amp; showed it to him. And this was all the evidence given in the case. After the argument was concluded the court delivered to the jury three written instructions as follows.</p>
<p>Comth vs Kirtley,</p>
<p>"The Court instruct the Jury if they believe from the evidence to the exclusion of all reasonable doubt, that the accused did before the finding of the indictment in the County of Muhlenberg feloniously<pb/>
<lb/><note place="left margin">9</note>
<lb/>take and carry away Forty five dollars the money of John Dearing, as charged in the indictment and with the intent at the time of s<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> taking and carrying away to convert the same to the defts own use, they should find him guilty and fix his punishment at confinement in the penitentiary of the state not less than two nor more than four years.</p>
<p>The Court further say, to the Jury that if they entertain a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendant growing out of all the evidence in the case they should acquit him.</p>
<p>R. T. Petree,</p>
<p>Further that the law presuming the innocense of the deft until he is proved to be guilty.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">R. T. Petree</hi></p>
<p>And these were all the instruction asked or given</p>
