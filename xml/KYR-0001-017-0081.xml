<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>The
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky,
<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>The office of Justice of the Peace in the district no 2. of Clark County is vacated by the removal of Achilles Eubank formerly a justice, from said county -- and the people of said district very much need. and desire that said office be filed as soon as possible. and I would respectfully suggest the name of (Lenard Beall as a proper person for that<pb/>
<lb/>position. He lives in a villiage of the precinct. where a great deal of its business is done. is interested and identified with it. and is emenintly qualified for the place. and His appointment I feel sure would be very acceptible to a large marjority of the people of the precinct</p>
<p>Yours respectfully
<lb/>A. L Haggard P. J. C.C. C</p>
<p>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>I have read. and concur in the suggestion of Judge Haggard. above</p>
<p>C S Hanson
<lb/>County Atty<pb/></p>
