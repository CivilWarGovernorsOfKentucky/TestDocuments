<lb/>To, His
<lb/>Exellency, Beriah Magoffin.
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Our Senator and Representative inform me that provision is made in the military bill for the payment of the money loaned to the State by Some of the Banks, in your application to buy arms for the State. I am glad of this, as taunts have been occasionally thrown out in my presence, that the Legislature would not probably recognise the loan of $60.000 -- made by this Bank, and I have consequently felt anxious that persons indulging in Such inimations Should be disappointed. Some members of our brand also express some anxiety to have the matter closed up; and Your Excellency will please have the Kindess to advise me when the bonds will be ready, probably, for delivery.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Joseph Lewis of Barren C<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">o</hi></hi> was today nominated for Congress by the State Rights party in this district.</p>
<p>Please advise me Concerning the Bonds by return mail and oblige</p>
<p>Yours, Very Truly &amp; Respy
<lb/>G, W. Norton

<p>Norton of Logan -- Sec will answer the Board will meet on Friday when the matter will be alluded to.</p>
