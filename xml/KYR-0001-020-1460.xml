<p>Allow me to tax your generosity &amp; kindness, to intercede with his Excellency the Govenor -- for the remission of a fine assessed or found against me for fifty ($50 at the June Term of our circuit court. These hard times it would really destroy me very much to pay out So much money for nothing.</p>
<p>I have a very large family to Support &amp; they are all girls &amp; 50 dollars would go fare towards clothing &amp; feeding them through the approaching winter.</p>
<p>I do hope the Govener will remit the fine as <hi rend="underline">I am or was not</hi> <hi rend="underline">guilty</hi> of the misdemer for which I was fined. <hi rend="str">for</hi> Do What you can &amp; Say to the Govenor that he has it in his power to make or releve a needy family of a burden for which they will allway hold in greatful remembrance</p>
<p>Your Friend Ambrose, H, Talbott<pb/></p>
