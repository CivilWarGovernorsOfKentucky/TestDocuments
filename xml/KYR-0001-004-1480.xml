<lb/>To his Excellency the Governor of Ky
<lb/>Honored Sir</p>
<p>In the case of Geo Woodruff who was lately convicted of a felony in the Jefferson Circuit Court I was the prosecuting witness and the only sufferer by the fraud which was practiced viz what is called the confidence game I am convinced that Miller the younger of the two men convicted was the designer of the fraud and I am not convinced that Woodruff was a guilty party in the transaction. On account of a young and I believe a virtuous and good wife who is now protectorless with a young child to support I appeal you to pardon him And if not entirely innocent this lesson will be enough to punish him for his first offince Resply</p>
