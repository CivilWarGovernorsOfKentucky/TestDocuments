   <p>To his excellency B Magoffin Govern of the Comlth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully represent that at this <date when="1861-08">August term 1861</date> of the Campbell Circuit Court Charles Marz was tried under an indictment for permiting unlawful gaming on his premises. It appeared in evidence that Mr Marz was the keeper of a Country Tavern in Campbell County &amp; that some games have been played on his premises for treats of beer &amp;c and consequently the Jury felt called on to find him guilty and fixed his fine at $200.x the lowest sum under the statute.</p>
<p>Your petitioners would represent that Mr Marz is a man of family &amp; an industrious peacable good citizen of small means and that the above fine falls very heavy on him and your petitioners most respectfully recommend him to your consideration and ask that his fine may be remitted -- </p>
