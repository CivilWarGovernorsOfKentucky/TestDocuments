   <p>To His Excellency Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Governor. of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Robert Bishop states that at the <date when="1861-08">August Term 1861.</date> of the City Court of Louisville he was fined $50 -- for carrying Concealed a pistol. Your Petitioner is a resident of Lexington Ky -- and was on a visit to Louisville, where the weapon was taken from him &amp; the fine imposed, The trial was had when he was in Lexington &amp; he made no offense, He had a right to carry the weapon, when travelling &amp; had he defended he would not have been fined. Wherefor he asks for a remission of said fine.</p>
<p>Respectfully, 
<lb/>Robert Bishop</p>
<p>The facts stated in the forgoing petition, are true, &amp; under all the circumstances, I concur with the petitioner &amp; asks for a remission of the fine</p>
<p>W, G, Reasor</p>
<p>I think that this fine, imposed without defense, and under the impression well-founded that the case would be dismissed without trial, ought to be remitted. I therefore concur with the Prosecuting Attorney in the case, W. G. Resor, in asking for a remission</p>
