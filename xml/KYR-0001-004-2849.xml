   <p>Piketon, Ky. <date when="1865-12-02">Dec. 2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> '65</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Gov. Bramlette
<lb/>Dr, Sir.</p>
<p>I am requested by M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Rice to give a statement of the main facts proved in the case of the Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> vs. Wash Chafin, in the Lawrance Circuit Court, &amp; who you have lately pardoned, so that you could act inteligently in the case of James Short, who is included in the same indictment with Chafin, but was not tried.</p>
<p>It was proved that Chafin &amp; Short, two young men, passed Esquire Holbrock's house one evening on horse-back on their way to Graham's &amp; get some whiskey; that they talked with Holbrook &amp; told him they would stop on their return &amp; let him have some; that about 9 or 10 o'clock at night he heard them return &amp; they did not stop but passed on &amp; from their manner of talking he took them to be drunk; that next day he found that he lost three sides of leather that night, &amp; believing that they took it, he send them word to fetch it back; that the leather was brought<pb/>
<lb/>back &amp; laid near the fence on the premises of the said Holbrock; the said parties it appeared also had made some acknowledgements about the takeing of the leather, allegeing in extenuation that they took it while drunk on the night in question &amp; that when they recieved the word from the Holbrook &amp; realized what they had done they clandestinely returned the leather &amp; laid it near the fence where found. These were the main facts proved against Chafin &amp; of course apply to Short as well.</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Your Obt. Servant
<lb/>J. S. Dury</p>
<p>N. B. Chafin is a married man &amp; the leather was taken to his house &amp; from the marks on the saddle, had been carried by him; Short is a single man, &amp; lived with his father four miles beyond the house of Chafin.</p>
