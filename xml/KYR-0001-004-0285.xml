   <p>Commonwealth of Kentucky,
<lb/>EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,
<lb/>Frankfort, <date when="1863-11-21">Nov 21 1863</date>.
<lb/>To his Ex<hi rend="sup">cy</hi> Gov Bramlette</p>
<p>The petn I leave on your table is signed by some of the best men of Owen County. The Tavern Keeper I am satisfied from what I heard said of the case, by respectable persons was made the victim of a panel of Wild fellows who were pretending that they were only playing the game of Faro to let a few see how it was played</p>
<p>I am not atty but leave the petn which was handed me simply for delivery<pb/>
<lb/>the costs same $250 or $260 will be a very severe punishment</p>
<p>If you can find it compatible with your sense of duty to remit the States part every body will be pleased who knows of the cases</p>
<p>Yours
<lb/>Tho N Lindsay</p>
