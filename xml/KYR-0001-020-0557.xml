   <p>To His Excelency
<lb/>B. Magoffin Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Pettioner Burgus Chancey would most respectfully beg leave to state to your Excellency that he was by a grand jury of Cumberland County indicted for its offence of a breach of the peace committed as alledged by fighting &amp; contending with one Rause Gambling &amp; at the <date when="1859-12">December Term of the Gumberland Circuit Court 1859</date> tried for s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> offence &amp; fined fifteen Dollars &amp; Ten days imprisonment in the county Jail, said judgement has never been executed, &amp; he now asks that s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> fine &amp; c be remitted by your Execelency for the reasons &amp; upon the grounds herein often stated &amp; set forth (Viz). During the Circuit aforsaid &amp; while said indictment was tried there was a <hi rend="str">large</hi> high freshet in Cumberland River across which he had a pass to get to s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Court. &amp; in consequence of s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> &amp; in consequence of sd freshet he was unavoidably prevented from appearing in s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Court and Depending s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> indictment. <hi rend="str">ats</hi>although he desired so to do. &amp; because he was not in fault in s<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> fight for which he was tried as aforesaid or the following this history of s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> fight will show your petitioner in going home from Burksville was insulted by one James Stockton who told your petitioner that he could whip ^him^ your petitioner then responded that he was his man &amp; they stated together &amp; s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Rause Gambling was between them -- cought him by the throat &amp; made some rough remark to Your petitioner who thereupon struck him<pb/>
<lb/>the said Gambling &amp; a fight then insued both of said men fighting him at the same time your petitioner getting a little the best of the fight (all in self defence however) they came to Town went before the grand jury &amp; upon their evidence s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> indictment was found &amp; s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Judgment obtained when if the facts had come and or they really existed he is confident that they jury would not have fined him exceeding one cent if any thing. He is a poor man with a family to support &amp; had rather be forced into a fight for South Carolina against the Abolitionist than to go to jail He in consideration of the premises asks that s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> firm &amp; <hi rend="str">judgment</hi> be remitted</p>
