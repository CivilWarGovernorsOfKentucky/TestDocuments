<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>The Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>The accompanying Petition prepared to forward to forward to Governor Robinson has been delayed and it is now enclosed to your Excellency as his successor. I heard the entire proof in the case and the Petition sets the<hi rend="str">n</hi> ^facts^ forth very fairly. The Petitioner was indicted with several others which may be the reason his fine was so severe. I am acquainted with the Petitioner and recommend him to Executive clemency. With assurances of high Esteem.</p>
<p>Your Obt Servant
<lb/>John P. Harrison
<lb/>P.S. Please address reply to Box 303. Covington, Ky.<pb/></p>
<p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Governor Bramlette</p>
