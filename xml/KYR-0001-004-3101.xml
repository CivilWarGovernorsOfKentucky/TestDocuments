   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>Thomas. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>You Petitioner Frances Stewart would respectfully state that she was fined one hundred dollars at the <date when="--11">November Term</date> of the City Court of Louisville for renting a house to be kept for bawdy purposes.</p>
<p>Your petitioner did rent a house to Alice Smith who was a woman of evil fame, the house was sublet by petitioner. It was admitted on the trial by the attorney for the city that petitioner was used as a tool for others who were wiser than she was. In fact petitioner was employed to rent the house by a man who wished to evade the law. He succeeded &amp; petitioner was left to satisfy the law that had been violated unwittingly by petitioner. Your petitioner is a colored woman, unable to read, &amp; did not know at the time that the law forbade the renting of houses to women of evil fame. The rent was paid to the owner of the house, &amp; no benefit accrued to petitioners Your petitioner has replevied the fine &amp; cost amounting to $144 <hi rend="sup">00/00</hi> by pledging all of her house hold furniture, which if taken will strip her of every thing she has in the world. She is old &amp; unable to make a living if thus deprived<pb/>
<lb/>of her property. She is unable to pay the find without giving up all she has &amp; she prays your Excellency to remit the amount</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Frances ^her x mark^ Stewart</p>
<p>Governor Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I defended old Frances Stewart on the above charge, &amp; could have proved that she was put forward to pull the Chestnut out of the fire, that a white man might save his own fingers; the man had been previously fined for the same offense &amp; to avoid a fine he got the poor old negro to rent it. I think old Fannie perfectly innocent of violating the law knowingly. After she was fined she was arrested on a Copias &amp; to keep out of the work house she mortgaged all she had in the world. If she has to pay the fine &amp; cost which amounts to $144 it will take all she has. I think it a case where the Governor should interpose &amp; save the old woman. I hope you will remit it</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>I. Hop. Price</p>
<p>I did make the admission as stated in the foregoing petitioner, &amp; believe the same to be true</p>
