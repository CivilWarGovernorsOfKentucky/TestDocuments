<lb/>Hon Thos E Brambet
<lb/>Gover. of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed is the petition of John Marques of this county which explains itself. I will add that the facts are I believe correctly stated, but no Do fully as they might have been John Neal is his son in law, lived near the time between Scalt &amp; Grant. There was a great nest of theives in his neighborhood that <unclear>annoyd</unclear> the people greatly. Neal was accused of being one of the theives -- was tried with a number of others &amp; held to bail by a court of inquiry -- Marques was his bail.<pb/></p>
<p>After the trial a company of citizens mostly Home guards &amp; mostly <hi rend="underline">good citizens</hi> held a meeting &amp; resolved that John Neal should leave ^the^ neighborhood together with his brother Thomas Neal &amp; others or they would hang them. Neal was notified &amp; left &amp; has never returned -- now as I am informed lives out of the state -- I believe in Ia. The others left also -- The stealing had no connection with the rebelion the Neals being loyal Union men &amp; prosecuted in partly the best Union men in the county. Neal is a bad man but is <unclear>fair</unclear>. I was prosecuting him &amp; know what I write is true -- Marques <hi rend="underline">gets drunk</hi> -- but is an industrious peaceable old man -- is loyal -- owns 200 acres of poor bushy hill land &amp; nothing now<pb/>
<lb/>has a host of grandchildren to support -- the family of one son who has been in the Federal army since <date when="1861">1861</date> being of the number. He is truly &amp; actively loyal &amp; c &amp; except his dispotition is a harmless citizen -- is old &amp; infirm &amp; will be ruined -- utterly ruined -- if he has this Jugt to pay. I therefor earnestly write in asking that you remit it all except officers fees &amp;c If desired he will try to get Neal &amp; have him tried although he is his son in law.</p>
<p>Truly &amp;c N L Rankin</p>
<p>His land is to be sold on the <date when="1863-12-14">14th inst.</date> Mr Scott is the comwlths atty</p>
