<lb/>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the last Term of the Fulton Equity &amp; Criminal Mike Sherran was tried under an indictment for murder &amp;was found guilty of manslaughter &amp;sent to the Penetintiary for three years. Col Lannon will hand you the evidence in the case certified by the Commonwealth's Attorney. You will see that the Evidence of the witnesses who prove that Sherman took any part in the fight is contradicted by several other witnesses who saw it &amp;who swear that Sherran took no part in the fight &amp; did not strike a single blow.</p>
<p>The evidence all together leaves<pb/>
<lb/>very uncertain whether Mike struck a single blow or took any part whatever in the fight. The Evidence very clearly shows that George Mathews who was also convicted &amp;sent for 10 years Killed the man. Therefore Governor I believe that Justice requires that mike sherran should not be further punished. I respectfully request Your Excellency to Pardon Sherran he is an honest hard working man &amp; has always been a peacable citizen. The language and conduct of deceased was well calculated to arouse the passions of any man living in the south.</p>
<p>deceased was a miserable drunken vagabond from Ohio or Pennsylvania the constant associate<pb/>
<lb/>of a drunken worthless free negro was nearly always in a brawl with some citizen on account of the sentiments he entertained in respect to slavery &amp; negroes -- I do not believe the proof made out any crime against Sherran</p>
<p>I am Respectfully your
<lb/><hi rend="str">Obt</hi> <hi rend="str">St</hi> friend
<lb/>Ed Crossland</p>
