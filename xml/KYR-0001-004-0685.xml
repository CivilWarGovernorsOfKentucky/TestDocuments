   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E Bramlett
<lb/>Gov of the Comm of Ky.</p>
<p>We the undersigned being members of the bar, and officers of the City Court <hi rend="str">Court</hi> of Louisville. State that we are acquainted with the case of George Kenniston and Robert Johnston, upon whose bonds W B Hoke was Surety. That both parties made several appearances in this court, and their case was continued by the Commonwealth. We have heard that one of them was in the employ of a Government Boat, and that he could not obtain leave of absence from his officers on said boat to be here at his trial at the time of the forfeiture of said bond. Knowing the case as we do, we think it a case <hi rend="str">for the</hi> worthy of your excellencies Clemency. We think W. B. Hoke the Surety has paid enoughf <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> ^in^ paying the portion to which the Commonwealth's Attorney is entitl<hi rend="str">l</hi>ed.</p>
<p>We therefore respectfully ask<pb/>
<lb/>ask that your Excellency will remit such porition of the forfeiture, as may be in your power-</p>

<lb/>Phil Tommpert Jr Clerk of the Court

<p>I reccollect that a Telegraphic dispatch was handed to me in the absence of Mr Hoke. Said despatch was from Robert Johnston saying that he was at St Louis Mo upon a Government vessell and would be here as soon as he could get leave ^of absence^ from his officers. Hoke again received a letter from Paducah Ky, from Johnston saying the boat was there and he hoped he would be able to be in Louisville in a short time. I have examined the petition of W. B. Hoke and certify to the facts contained therein.</p>
<p>S. S. English<pb/></p>
<p>I might have obtained as many names as would fill a sheet of paper, but thought it unnecessary I have asked no one to sign their names except the officers and a few of the Attorneys of the Police Court that reccollect the case-</p>
<p>W. B. Hoke </p>
