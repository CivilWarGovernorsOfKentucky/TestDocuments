   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. E. Bramlette.
<lb/>Governor.</p>
<p>On visiting the Pententiary to day found a soldier belonging to My Regt. confined there. His name is James Farrel, and as I learn he was sent here from Louisville for a charge of stealing a horse. It is not probable to My Mind that Farrel was guilty of the crime for he was a good soldier and had never shown any dishonesty in the Regt. He was at the time of taking possession Of the very much distracted in Mind from previous drinking excessively.</p>
<p>It was known that from that cause he was once before deranged for a time </p>
<p>Now he wants to return to his regiment and I respectfully ask your Excellency pardon him &amp; send him to the Regt.</p>
<p>Verry Respectfully
<lb/>Your Obt Svt W. P. Boone Col 28 Ky<pb/></p>
