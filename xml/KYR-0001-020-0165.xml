   <p>To his Ecl<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">y</hi></hi> B. Magoffin Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner H, O, Wilds would humbly state that at the present term of the Jackson Circuit Court he was fined fifty dollars upon an indictment <hi rend="str">affair</hi> for an alledged offence of carraying consealed a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>He states that he was not guilty of carrying the weapon, that it was his brothers pistol and he was only carrying it home for him in his coat pocket and does not believe it was concealed from ordinary observation</p>
<p>He states that <hi rend="str">he states th</hi> he is quite a young man and his mother is a widow and has a large family of little children, his father having lately died leaving nothing for the support of his family and it takes all his time and labor to assist his widowed mother in her support of the little infant children, and it will be almost impossible for him to pay the fine, for he has no property and would have to work it out by days works at a low price and the family cannot spare his labor. Wherefor he humbly asks a remission of the fine,</p>
<p>H. O Wilds</p>
<p>Sworn to before me by H. O. Wild this <date when="1860-11-13">13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day Nov 1860</date></p>
<p>H Freeman J P J -- <pb/></p>
<p>We the undersigned most humbly ask the fine against H. O. Wilds be remitted under the circumstances and condition of himself and his widowed mother &amp; her family of infant children</p>
