<lb/>Gov. Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed find Petition which will Explain itself</p>
<p>The man Flyn charged with killing a brother Irishman named Conner, was arrested last Summer and held to bail in the sum of $500, $250 for himself and $250 for<pb/>
<lb/>his securities, He was very poor, with an invalid wife and three small children dependent upon his daily labour for a support -- Our circuit court did not come off until the <date when="1861-04-01">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of Apri</date>l and rather than let him remain in Jail all fall &amp; winter Mr Wilson and myself entered as his securities -- The Iron Furnaces at which he was employed ceased operations and ^he^ went off to get work, and we have heard<pb/>
<lb/>that he is dead but cannot make the proof -- He would certainly have been acquitted if all the witnesses had appeared. None of the Commonwealths Witnesses have ever appeared, The recognisance was forfieted At our <date when="1861-04">April</date> Court the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Monday -- This is not one of these case which, I am informed occur so often in some large cities, where the bail gets the amt of the bond deposited with them before entering, We did not get one cent<pb/>
<lb/>If consistent with your feelings and sense of right, we would ask to have the amt remitted</p>
<p>yours respectfly
