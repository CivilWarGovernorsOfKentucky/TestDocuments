   <p>Mtsterling Montgomery County Ky 
<lb/><hi rend="str">And</hi></p>
<p>To the Trustees of Mtsterling Edgar Thompson represents that a short time before the last stay law went into effect he was called upon by one A J Summerville to become his surity in a recognizance to appear for trial at the <date when="1861-05">May Term 1861</date> ^police court^ -- That said Summerville had been statying with his father in law and he could not well refuse &amp;c And that he did become his surity But when the time arrived your Petitioner thought it only necessary that Summerville should appear himself. He therefore purchased him a horse and sent him to Town thinking and believing that was all he was required to do by law</p>
<p>He states that said Summerville did come to Town but never appeared in cour<hi rend="str">s</hi>t. That since which time he thought he was fully acquainted <hi rend="str">But</hi>until recently to wit at the last Court ^Police^ after <hi rend="str">by</hi> the expense of employing Counsel to represent the petitioner &amp; (who elicited the foregoing facts and circumstances) he finds that he has forfeited his recognizance and although believing from having procured a horse and sending the prisoner to Town that he was acquitted yet he is now responsible for his said recognizance<pb/>
<lb/>and it is adjudged for him to pay $25 and the cost the amount of his bond. He further states that said Summerville was arraigned for a breach of the peace that he has since left the county and is wholy insolvent your Petitioner therefore repectfully prays your body to release him of said forfeiture in as much as he protests he is innocent of any derilection of duty and the wrong perpetrated by your petioner was simply from ignorance</p>
