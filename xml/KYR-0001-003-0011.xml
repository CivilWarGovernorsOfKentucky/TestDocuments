<lb/>Gov. Bramlette.</p>
<p>There has been a band of Rebel Banditi perpetrating all kinds of outrages, in this and adjoining counties. for Several months Loyal citizens have been robed of their property and a reign of terror exists in many localities, and when the parties were arrested they claim to be Rebel Soldiers and have been permitted ^(in many instances)^ to take the Oath and return home while others have been exchanged and soon returned to renew their depredations, and on Sunday night their villians culminated in the cold blooded murder of Major Wildman of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky <unclear>v. o. I.</unclear> who had come home to remain until a wound healed, received while gallantly leading his Regiment in the late Battle of Chickamauga.</p>
<p>There was no truer patriot nor more gallant Officer in the Service. Something must be done to stop their proceedings, and we appeal to you to procure the issueing of an order holding Rebels responsible in life and property for all murders &amp; roberies in their vicinity or Such other orders as you think necessary under the circumstances If measures to attain the desired result<pb/>
<lb/>are not inaugerated by the proper authoritys we will be compelled to defend ourselves and avenge the fall of our friends.</p>
