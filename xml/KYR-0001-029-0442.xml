<lb/>To his Excellency Gov Robinson
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>From my recollection of the notes made by the examining Judge (which memorandum has been by some means lost or mislaid) in the above case it is my opinion that it is somewhat doubtful whether or not a conviction can be obtained</p>

<lb/>Dear Sir
<lb/>Please direct to us &amp; oblige &amp;c
<lb/>Respectfully,
<lb/>Baird &amp; Price<pb/></p>
<p>Baird &amp; Price attys ask remission of forfeited bond they surities -- </p>
<p>Refused</p>

<p>Respited for 12 months from the <date when="1863-12-19">19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Dec 1863</date></p>

<p>To His Excellency
<lb/>James F. Robinson
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners Robt F Baird &amp; J. H. Price, would respectfully state that they went upon the Bail Bond of John Leary for four hundred dollars $400 <hi rend="sup">00</hi>/<hi rend="sub">00</hi> to answer at the <date when="--01">January</date> Term of the Jefferson Circuit Court. At the <date when="--05">May</date> term of Said Court a judgment was rendered against your petitioners for said sum of $400 -- </p>
<p>Your petitioners were counsel for the said Leary &amp; took great interest in his case, &amp; believing in his innocence went upon his bond to answer without being indemnified. Petitioners were repaid with ingratitude, &amp; they now petition your Excellency to remit the amount. </p>
<p>The Circumstances of the case are as follows: John Leary in company with another man steped in to a Jewelry Store. The man with Leary asked to see a gold guard chain. A box containing chains was set upon the show case, &amp; several chains examined by the man; when a third party steped in<pb/>
<lb/>&amp; asked to see some other article &amp; the shopman stepping to an other part of the store to get it, was necessarily detained a few moments. The article brought for the third party seemed not to suit, &amp; he left the store. Some little time elapsed &amp; the shopman discovered that two or three of his chains were missing. This discovery was made when Leary &amp; his companion were in the store, but the third party had left. </p>
<p>The third party when in the store stood near enough to have stolen the chains. Leary was arrested but no chains were found upon him. Leary did not ask to see any thing, while in the store but seemed to act the part of a silent spectator.</p>
<p>Your Excellency will readily see that no conviction could be had upon the most vigerous prosecution.</p>
<p>Your petitioners respectfully ask that your Excellency remit the $400 <hi rend="sup">00</hi>/<hi rend="sub">00</hi> judgment rendered against them. Very Respectfully</p>
<p>Baird &amp; Price
