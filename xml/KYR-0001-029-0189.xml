<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>About the middle of December last a petition was addressed, to you by gentlemen of the Bar, asking you to excuse me from the payment of the sum of one hundred dollars, the amount of a forefeited recognizance bond. The grounds for release were, the fact of heavy losses by me on account of the rebellion and the fact that the party was accused of a trifling misdemeanor, and has been since the war commenced in the rebel army. and that at the time of Court when the judgment was obtained against me the rebels were claiming possession of this portion of the state. The petition was signed by the mem=<pb/>
<lb/>bers of the bar generally.</p>
<p>I have not had an answer from you in reply to my petition and I do not know whether the petition has failed to reach you or whether it is not granted. The execution is now in the hands of the Sheriff, and per consequence. I am anxious to know whether the amount is remitted or not. Please write me upon receipt of this at Louisville in the care of A B Semple &amp; Sons and obliged &amp;c.</p>
<p>Very respectfully Yr Obt St
<lb/> -- James Lester</p>

<p>I will be in Louisville until the <date when="1862-01-24">29</date> inst if you will please answer by that time you will much oblige</p>
<p>You Obt Servant
