<lb/><date when="1865-12-29">Decr 29. 1865</date>
<lb/>To his Excelency Thomas E Bramlette
<lb/>Gov of the state of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I feel that it is proper and just that I should make the following statement of facts in regard to a high-toned and honorable gentleman, who is desirous of your executive Clemency.</p>
<p>I have known Col John P Hall, for Eighteeen years, he having about that far back, worked at my father's house during his apprenticeship, at the carpenter's trade, since when, and up to the time he entered the milatary service for his country. I have known him to be an honest, industrious and able mechanic, and prosperous in his profession, in the town of Caseyville in this county -- Previous to his entering the Service aforesaid about <date when="1857-12">December 1857</date> he was tried in this town before a court of Inquiry, upon a charge of killing Dr. R W. N Taylor, and was committed to prison, where he suffered extraordinary hardships, from the hands of a drunken jailor for twelve months, when his case came on for trial, and the jury disagreeing he was admitted to bail, when he resumed his profession working by the day, paying the heavy attorney fees, he had contracted to secure a legal<pb/>
<lb/>defense, which he continued to do until 1861 attending court at each term -- </p>
<p>At this time he entered the service of his country, first, attempting to raise a company in this County, for which he was persecuted and Compelled to flee the state. This was the first attempt of the kind ever made in this county -- He then immediately entered the milatary service of the United States at Shawneetown Illinois, where I saw him soon after in the uniform of a private soldier -- He remained absent from this county until <date when="1865-09">Sept 1865</date> -- during his absence I corresponded with him, and know of his being an officer in the army at Paducah Ky -- at Corinth Miss. and at Vicksburgh, (where he was wounded) at Memphis Tenn -- on a milatary commission -- commanding a regiment in Alabama, Georgia, and in the great march of Sherman to the final surreder of the rebel armies; when he came with his command in the 15 A C army of the Tenn, to Louisville Ky, and went with the 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Division 15 corps to Little Rock Ark, where he was honorably mustered out with his command in <date when="--08">August</date> last</p>
<p>I have seen his commissions from the Gov of Illinois
<lb/>One as Capt of the 56th Ills Infty dated <date when="1862-02">Feb 1862</date><pb/>
<lb/>One as Major in the 56 Ills Infty dated <hi rend="str">February</hi><date when="1862-11">Nov 1862</date>
<lb/>One as Lt Col " " " " " <date when="1863-08">Augt 1863</date>.
<lb/>One as Col " " " " " <date when="1865-03">March 1865</date>.
<lb/>and his honorable discharge dated <date when="1865-08">augt 1865</date></p>
<p>From conversing with the witnesses, and hearing the testimony in court, I have always, believed that Hall killed Taylor in self defense -- And from the statements of men and witnesses, of matters, that <hi rend="str">that</hi> w<hi rend="str">as</hi>ere ruled out upon the attempted trial -- I am forced to the belief, that Hall suffered grievous and cruel wrong at the hands of Taylor, whose conduct produced a severance of that holiest of ties the relation of Husband and wife -- </p>
<p>And lastly, from my intimate knowledge of the case, I am clearly of the opinion that its further continuance can only result in heavy and unnecessary expense to the commonweath, and oppression to the Defendant -- and that the extension of the executive power in the immediate and final pardon of ^col^ Hall, would be simply an act of justice to a meriotrious and deserving man</p>
