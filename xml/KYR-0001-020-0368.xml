   <p>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin 
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>The undersigned Jurors in the case of the Commonwealth of Ky. vs Nicholas Fulks tried at the present term of the Campbell Circuit Court, for having in his possession Counterfeit money, would most respectfully represent to your Excellency that the above Deft is a young man, a stranger among us, he has the appearance of being a hardworking, young man, and although we are satisfied that he had the money in his possession and knew the same to be Counterfiet, yet we are satisfied that he was imposed upon by designing men who are the real Criminals in this case but who unfortunately have Escaped the punishment they so richly deserve by <unclear>right</unclear> -- we would under the circumstances recommend the above Deft as a fit subject for Executive clemency, more especially as the Deft (although he had the money in his possession for some time) never offered to pass any of said money as far as we can learn</p>
