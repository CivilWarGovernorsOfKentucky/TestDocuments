<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Gov.. Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.. E Bramlette</p>
<p>The most unpleasant visitor I have ever had (and the first one of the kind) called upon me this morning, in the <hi rend="underline">Shape</hi> of a <hi rend="underline">Sheriff</hi>, and made me pay him a fine which Father will explain</p>
<p>I write you for the purpose of setting forth the facts connected with the case, About 5 of 6 years ago, I was in Lancaster and met with a very nice young man (and a kinsman) who was a little inebriated, and had a pistol or a knife, I disremember which, I took it away from him an carried it out home with me, I appeared before the court (as well as I can remember) and explaind matters and the impression was made in my mind that it was set aside, So I think there must be among some where, I never carried any thing of the kind before the war, If the fine was Just I would not care, However Father will explain matters fully, so I will say no more, except that any thing you may, or can do in my behalf, will be indelibly engraven upon the Tablets of my memory</p>
<p>I am very Respectfully
<lb/>Your Most Obt Servt
