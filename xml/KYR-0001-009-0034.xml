<lb/>Capt Drinkwater
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I understand that you have been circulating the infamously false statement that I had received as a bribe from ^some^ person the sum of eighteen hundred dollars -- as an inducement to not stop the navigation until certain capitolist could get out their Tobacco, and that I had made the <unclear/> sum and had pocketed it, and you intended -- that the publick should be apprised of it -- &amp;c</p>
<p>Now Sir I have this to Say to you or any living man who makes the charge against me that I have swerved from ^my^ duty from any Consideration of a pecuniary charactor that it is false and that I demand of you a retraction at once</p>
