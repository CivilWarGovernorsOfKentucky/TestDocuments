   <p>Lexington <date when="1863-07-08">July 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 63</date>.
<lb/>Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Robinson
<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir,</p>
<p>Mr White of this town became the bail of a man by the name of Robt Thompson, who was indicted in the Fayette Circuit Court for obtaining property under false pretenses. I did not think much of Thompson, <hi rend="str">thou</hi> White I have known for many years. He is a clever gentleman &amp;, in my opinion, went the bail of Thompson, <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>in full faith that he would appear to answer the charge. Thompson professed to be a business man but left as I am informed, with the Rebels, when driven out last fall by Gen Buell. Being in the Confederate lines, it is impossible that White can procure his amnt. I feel satisfied, he would produce him if it were in his power, White is well known to the atty<pb/>
<lb/>for the Comm, as is also Thompson, and I presume will agree with me as to the character of the man,</p>
<p>The sum which White will have to pay the Officers, is a severe penalty on him, and a release of the balance of this judgment will, I think, be but justice, as he did not, in my opinion, anticipate the escape of Thompson to parts <hi rend="str">and</hi> <hi rend="str"><unclear/> probably</hi> beyond the reach of our laws, and his inability to arrest &amp; surrender him on his failure to make his appearance.</p>
<p>Yours
<lb/>R A Buckner</p>
<p>I fully concur in the truth of the foregoing statements and if your Excellency can, hope you ^will^ grant M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> White a remission</p>
<p>Resp'fuly
<lb/>W. P. Downey<pb/></p>
<p>Govr. Robinson</p>
