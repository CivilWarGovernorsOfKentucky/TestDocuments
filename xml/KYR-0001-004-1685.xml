<lb/>Mr John M Harlan</p>
<p>My dear Sir. I especially desire you immediately to attend to this favor</p>
<p>In the first year of my practice <date when="1855">1855</date> I defended one G G Green who was indicted for permitting gaming in his house by the grand jury of Union County and at the <date when="1855-10">October Term of said Court 1855</date> a judgment went against him for $200. I prepared a petition which was duly signed and in person on the <date when="1855-11-14">14th day of November 1855</date> while on a visit to my mother near Frankfort presented it to Gov Morehead -- I remember as if yesterday, that he told me he would remit the fine unless a remonstrance came up against it and in the meantime as was his custom he would respite for six months, which he did and handed me the respite, I have it now before me among the papers of the case. I know that no remonstrance was ever sent up. The matter has been overlooked until lately -- I did not draw Gov M's attention at the end of the six months to send the remission The clerk endorsed the respite as a release and it was not until<pb/>
<lb/>lately that a new clerk in looking up all the old Commonwealths judgements in obedience to an act of the Legislature found the mistake in the endorsement &amp; that no release was in the papers -- and has issued an execution -- I write to you because you know me, and these facts being in my knowledge I wish you to present this to Gov Bramlette with the assurance that he can rely on the truth of what I say -- My client and I were both since then until now convinced the whole matter except fees &amp; costs had been released and the fees and costs have long since been paid -- I was going to Frankfort partly on other business and to visit my old home and Mr Green paid a part of my expenses for my services in his petition and I would feel badly and do to see him troubled at this length of time -- Please do not fail immediately to reply= I send the Secretary's fee of $2.00 for papers of remission in case <hi rend="str">it</hi> the application succeeds</p>
<p>Yr friend
