<p>And this Deponent further saith that the young man Freeman enjoyed an excellent reputation among his friends and acquaintances for honesty &amp; integrity and was never as this Deponent believes charged with any criminal offence but on the contrary thereof seemed to be free from any bad habits or associations.</p>
