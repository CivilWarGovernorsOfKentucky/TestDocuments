   <p>Trimble County Sct</p>
<p>Mathew M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Collister of the County of Trimble states that on or about the day of <date when="1862-08">August 1862</date>: this affiant was at a meeting of persons at a place called Providence of said County, during the trial of one Minor Horton a repected member of the Baptist Church: that said trial was on Saturday for having injured and taken away the property of his sister in Law Mrs. Buckannon that <hi rend="str">his</hi> ^this affiant^ was no member of said church but as usual living only one mile from the place of the meeting was in attendance, that during the defence made by said Horton, in room of turning his attention to the presiding Officer the said Horton turned his face &amp; attention to this affiant and by innuendoes &amp; other demonstration attempted to mark him as the prosicutor. that the church had called to the care of said church a friend of this affiant one Thomas Runnels in room of said Horton: and to this fact the affiant believes (in connexion with the fact that he had <hi rend="str">injured</hi> taken the property of his relative M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Buckannon). The conduct of said Horton was so offensive to the church and those in attendance at the meeting this affiant denies that he acted as prosicutor <hi rend="str">that</hi> or that he said one word in said meeting -- that after the meeting Was over he &amp; some gentlemen &amp; lady were in front of the meeting house discussing church decipline as they had right to do at that time and the said Horton in an insulting manner contrary to the teaching of his master with proud &amp; boastful Words in the hearing of the Gentleman &amp; Lady &amp; others states that they need not believe <hi rend="str">that</hi> him meaning this affiant, that he was<pb/></p>
<p>a "notorious liar and pay no attention to him" <hi rend="str">that</hi> this affiant believing that as the meeting &amp; services were over and that said Horton had placed himself on a footing with men of the world and having drawn near to the affiant he assaulted him. that said Horton during his trial and after the trial acted not the part of a Christian, much less <hi rend="str">pretending as a</hi> that for a teacher of Religion. that it is true that this affiant may have acted not the part of a Christian, at that time but the taunting manner of said Horton, together with his following him up and word for which he has no legal redress induced the assault that he has a family of five children, that he has to labour hard to live. that he has been fined $200 wrongfully. that he cannot pay it willingly. He makes this affidavit in support of a petition filed by his neighbors &amp; fellow citizens for the remitter. that he could obtain many others.</p>
