   <p>To His Excellency B. Magoffin
<lb/>Gov Kentucky</p>
<p>We the Undersigned Citizens of Campbell County Kentucky would respectfully represent that John O Hay was convicted at the present <date when="--11">Nov<hi rend="sup">r</hi></date> term of the Campbell Circuit Court of the offense of Arson. <hi rend="str">to wit setting</hi> And sentenced to One years confinement in the penitentiary. The facts in the case were these that said O Hay enlisted and was at Camp Webster a short distance from Newport that he was ordered under arrest and confined in a temporary shed or place building used as a Guard house, that while so confined the building was discovered on fire and was quickly extinguished. The proff in the case against him was circumstantial &amp; taking into consideration the number of troops at said Camp &amp; the<hi rend="str">ir</hi> habits of a portion of them there was much to afford a <hi rend="str">reasonable</hi>probable doubt of his guilt We are deeply impressed with the conviction that his case is one that calls for the Executive clemency</p>
