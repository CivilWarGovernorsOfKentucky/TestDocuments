   <p>To his Excellency Gov.
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort Ky.</p>
<p>On the <date when="1864-01-22">22<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> day of January 1864</date>, C. T. Embry a youth of fifteen years, was fined fifty dollars by the Police Court of Shelbyville, for the offense of carrying concealed a deadly weapon. We think that he has been hardly dealt with</p>
<p>He at the time of the offence was at school here and but recently come to school, and as is often the case, the older scholars or some of them were trying his mettle by tempting him to fight, and on the day of the alledged offence two boys were following him up and provoking him, and were accompanied by other boys as mere spectators, but supposed by Young Embry to be participants. He being a new boy and not knowing who were friendly, and who not went to his room and got his pistol and loaded it, and met the party of youths; when going on an errand for a lady at his boarding house. An altercation ensued- The principal aggressor called him a liar, Embry returned the complement. His opponent struck him, and he fired on him inflicting a scratch on his hand.</p>
<p>We think that as boys they should have been punished by their parents or teacher, or if treated as men he was justifiable in having the weapon under the circumstances. The carrying at the time was for the defence of his person and not in violation of the law. We therefore respectfully request your Excellency to remit the fine assessed against him</p>
<p>T. B. Cochran
<lb/>T O. Shackleford<pb/></p>
<p>I was not present at the trial, but I learn that the lad Embry, was really not guilty of carrying a pistol concealed upon his person, but simply when beset, went to his room &amp; got his pistol to defend himself. His teacher says he is one of the best boys he ever saw, and I have no doubt that he is a moral sober, peacable lad, and ought never to have been find, &amp; I earnestly solicit a remission of his fine. He is from Richmond Ky &amp; is here at school, a stranger, when the thing occurred.</p>
<p>Z. Wheat</p>
<p>I was the Town Marshall that arrested young Embry &amp; attended the trial &amp; heard the evidence, &amp; have no doubt that the conviction was improper &amp; unjust</p>
