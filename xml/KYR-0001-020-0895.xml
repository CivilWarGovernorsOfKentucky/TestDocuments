<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>B Magoffin:</p>
<p>There is now depending in the Lincoln Circuit an Indictment against a large number of persons who were engaged in the mob that hung Jasper Rowsey.</p>
<p>They are mostly men of high standing and rank amongst the best of the County. -- They greatly erred, but thought they were doing right. -- They acted under a mistake as to duty, but they acted honestly &amp; in good faith; believing what they did to be a duty.</p>
<p>The law has been sufficiently vinidicated by their being indicted. No one wishes to see them further punished. -- In view of all the circumstances, I <hi rend="underline">earnestly</hi> urge a pardon for them, from your Excellency It will be a proper exercise of Executive clemency &amp; meet approval of just men</p>
<p>Yrs Respectfully
<lb/>Tho. E. Bramlette</p>
