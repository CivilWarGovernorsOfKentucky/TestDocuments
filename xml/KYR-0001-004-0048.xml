<lb/>Gov Bramlett Esqr
<lb/>Frankfort KY
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Enclosed I send you the petition of John Galvin and many citizens praying that John Galvin be relieved of the fine imposed upon him by the City Court. I have no interest in this matter beyond that of any other of the citizens who join Galvin in asking the remission of the fine</p>
<p>I have been interested so far in this case as to ask you to remit this fine because Galvin is a <hi rend="underline">poor, industrious, honest man</hi>. Harper may also be poor, but he is dissipated reckless &amp; worthless; and further because this trouble grew out of political toubles between Galvin &amp; Harper, the first a good and staunch union man and the other a rebel; and <hi rend="str">be</hi> because, as I believe, had it not been for the conduct of Harper the difficulty would have never been. Mr Reasor the Prosecutor<pb/></p>
<p>petitions for the remission of half the fine, this I take it under all the circumstances surrounding the case is sufficient evidence that Executive clemency should intervene and the whole fine be remitted.</p>
<p>I trust, Governor, that you will remit the whole.</p>
<p>I am respectfully your Friend
<lb/>Jo<hi rend="sup">s</hi> G. Watson</p>
<p>P. S.</p>
<p>Should you remit the fine enclose &amp;c &amp;c to Jo<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Enders care of Severson &amp; Enders at this city.</p>
<p>J. G. W.</p>
