   <p>San Francisco <date when="1861-10-16">October 16th 1861.</date>
<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Hon Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of the state of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>The undersigned a citizen of the state of California since <date when="1849">1849.</date> and a Notary Public in and for the County of San Francisco, would most respectfully but urgently request at the hands of your Excellency to be appointed a commissioner (resident in California) to take proofs and acknowledgments to be used in the state of Kentucky</p>
<p>It would perhaps be unnecessary for me to refer your Excellency to third parties with reference to my standing as a citizen or my ability to fulfill the duties incumbent on such a commissioner -- from the fact that I now hold two commissions -- one from the Governor of the state of California as a Notary Public and one from the Governor of the state of Ohio as a commissioner for said state resident in California</p>
<p>I have been induced to make this application to your Excellency -- for the reason that<pb/>
<lb/>the bestowment of such a commission would be a source of profit to me -- but also a matter of great convenience to my friends and the public generally</p>
<p>Your Excellency would therefore confer a great obligation upon the undersigned by giving this application a favorable consideration</p>
<p>I have the honor to be
<lb/>Your Excellency's
<lb/>Obt Servt
