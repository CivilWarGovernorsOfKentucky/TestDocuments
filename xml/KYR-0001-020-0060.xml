<p>Turner A. Lowry states, that he has long been acquainted with Thomas B. Wadlington and with his general moral character, and he says, that he has always been reputed as a man of good moral character, peacable orderly and law abiding, and such he believes to be the almost universal opinion. He says that he has been and is acquainted with the character of the deceased Cartwright, and he does verily believe that he was a violent and dangerous young man, and that such he believes to be the general opinion of his neighbors and acquaintances. </p>
<p>He states, that he is well satisfied, that the whole facts in regard to the manner and mode of attack has not been, and was not truly stated to the Jury in the trial, and he does believe, that manifest injustice was done by the verdict. He does verily believe, that the killing of Cartwright was in necessary self defence, <hi rend="str">and that Wadlington ought to be fully pardoned</hi>.</p>
