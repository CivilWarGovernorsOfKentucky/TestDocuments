<lb/>My Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Enclosed you will find a petition to Govenor Magoffin and a letter from me to him, asking for a pardon of a young man now in jail, convicted of larceny, and sentenced to the penitentiary for one year. I send them to you, and through you to the Gov. that he may certianly get them, and that his attention may be especially called to it. I trust you will do me the favor to call immediately on the Gov. and urge him to act upon it at once -- Young Peak has a widow mother, and an exceedingly clever, honest, and industrious woman, she is distressed beyond measure, &amp; seems to be allmost beside herself_ I have obtained but few signers to the petition but those are of the best men, of our city -- The young man was in my judgement induced to do this and, it is his fault and from his present state of feeling I believe him to be amply repentant -- ask the govenor if he pleases for my sake, pardon this man -- <pb/>
<lb/>I would not ask it, if I did not believe the young man should be pardoned. I sincerely believe he will do right hereafter and make a good boy &amp; an industrious man -- you can read my letter to the Gov. and ask the petition &amp; better understand the case -- If the Gov. will pardon him will you telegraph me of the fact, the young man does not want to go to Frankfort if it can be helped -- </p>
<p>I hope you will see the Gov. immediately and urge him to act in the case at once -- </p>
<p>All are well -- </p>
<p>Give my love to GrandMa, and believe me to be truly your friend &amp; Relative</p>
<p>G. Clay Smith<pb/></p>
