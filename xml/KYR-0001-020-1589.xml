   <p>Louisville <date when="1861-12-10">Dec 10<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> 1861 -- </date>
<lb/>Hon. B. Magoffin.
<lb/>Gov. State of Ky.
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>Sometime in the latter part of <date when="1861-10">Octo. (1861.)</date> last I met a Gentleman by the name of Devenport near the corner of 9<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> &amp; Main Streets in this City. He said to me he had several letters of introduction from Gentlemen of Bowling Green he wished me to see. We stepped into a coffee House Kept by a Mr Tammage, and took seats in the sitting room room. two other Gentlemen present, whilst in conversation Thomas R. Parrent come in from an adjoining room. Rather intoxicated, evidently excited. The langauge &amp; manner rather insulting. none of the Gentlemen in the room spoke. at length Tammage asked Parrent who he ment by <hi rend="str">t</hi>his remarks he said Walker (one of the Gentlemen present) Walker trew down his head, without reply. Parrent continued to talk. When Tammage said to Strange <hi rend="underline">who</hi> <hi rend="underline">is</hi> <hi rend="underline">very</hi> <hi rend="underline">Deaf</hi>. "Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi> it is you Tom's talking of says are a Damned Secesh." Stange putting his hand to his Ear said. "What." Tammage repeated the words. Strange Jumped up &amp; with a little Hickory stick he had in his hand struck Parrent a smart Blow across the forehead over the left Eye.</p>
<p>Mr Tammage afterward said he was wrong as Parrent had not named Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Strange. The next Day Strange sent<pb/>
<lb/>D<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Devenport to say to Parrent he had struck him under mi<hi rend="str">s</hi>saprehension &amp; would make any reperaton a Gentleman could. He refusing to except any.</p>
<p>Hence the Presentment &amp; fine of which I request the exercise of the Governors Clemency for relief</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Tho Strange</hi></p>
<p>Ten dollars is the amount of fine imposed in this case, and considering all the circumstances, known by me, since the trial &amp; of which the petitioner, had not the benefit at the trail of the cause, I respectfully recommend to Your Excellency Genl Strange as a high toned Gentleman, and his cause worthy of Executive clemency.</p>
<p>W. G. Reasor</p>
<p>I unite with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Reasor in recommending the case of my friend Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Strange to your favorable consideration</p>
