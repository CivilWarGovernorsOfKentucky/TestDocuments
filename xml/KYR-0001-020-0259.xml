   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner William Griffin states that some time in <date when="1860-09">Sept 1860</date> he was tried in the Police Court of Louisville upon a charge of selling spirits &amp; fined $20 -- &amp; costs &amp; also fined $2 -- &amp; cost for prohibiting an Irishman from beating a man at his house He states that he was not guilty of the charge of selling the spirits He states that the only witness against him was a drunken Irishman who this affiant had had a difficulty with he states that said witness swore falsely, &amp; has long since left this place. He states that he told his Atty to take an appeal in the cases &amp; suffered &amp; believed it had been done untill yesterday when the town Marshall called on him for said fines, whom greatly to his surprise he found no appeal had been taken, &amp; the time had expired for an appeal. He states that the fine of $2 -- was imposed upon him because he kept said drunken Irishman from beating an old inoffensive drunken man that he used no other or greater force than was necessary to protect the helpless, though said witness swore differently &amp; falsely too. He states that in<pb/>
<lb/>consequence of the failure of his Atty to take an appeal in said cases he is now remedyless &amp; he therefore prays your Excellency to remit said fines as in duty bound will ever pray</p>

<p>Dear Gov</p>
<p>I was the counsel of Griffin &amp; I neglected to take the appeal for him. The Court did right under the proof to fine Griffin, but the drunken fellow who swore against him did the same through spite &amp; has since left the county This is a meritorious case, &amp; I feel as if I am to blame for the condition the thing is in. I know you are annoyed very much <hi rend="str">fr</hi> with matters of this kind but you must for my sake remit these fines. I hope you will do so. Your proposition to the various Governors meets my approval. I hope you are well</p>
<p>Yours
