<lb/>Sir:</p>
<p>I have just resigned my position as an officer in the United States Army. I am impelled to this course for the reason that that army is being concentrated and used for the subjugation of the Southern people who have my entire sympathy.</p>
<p>I believe it is proper for me, here, to add that the time has come to pass when Southern blood is sufficient to attaint officers of the army; and unless they subscribe to new oaths, join bond in denouncing their late comrades of the south (who were the best men of the Army) as traitors, and invoke a war of extermination on their own people, and kindred suspicion and proscription are put upon them. </p>
<p>I am unable at this distance to understand the exact position that Kentucky occupies in the great struggle between the<pb/>
<lb/>two <hi rend="underline">sections</hi>, but I cannot believe that she can or will remain long a neutral spectator</p>
<p>If six years service in the army of the United States, will have given me any experience that will make my services acceptable in a military capacity to my nature state, that service will be far more gratifying to me than any in which I could be engaged.</p>
<p>I shall leave this coast immediately and endeaver to rearch Kentucky in Twenty five days, the, as the<hi rend="str">se</hi>ir is a strict watch placed over the lines of travel by the Federal Government, I may be unavoidably delayed.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be
<lb/>Sir, very respectfully
<lb/>Your obedient Servant
<lb/>N. Wickliffe
