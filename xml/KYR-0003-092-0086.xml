<lb/>Geo W. Johnson Esq
<lb/>My Dear Sir</p>
<p>While you were so constantly occupied last fall in fulfilling your political engagements I thought it best not to trouble you with those of a pecuniary character, and even now I name them with great reluctance.</p>
<p>Since you conversed with me on the subject of the Palmer matter I have had two letters from him -- One of regret in not being able to pay his annual interest and expressing his determination to sell his place and pay his debts -- The other is in reply to my enquiring in regard to the condition on which you said you agreed to sign the note with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hauly -- He does<pb/>
<lb/>not seem to recollect exactly what conversation took place between you when he asked for your name, except that he told you M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. H was a man of property and that you should not suffer -- He says that his property at a low calculation is worth $50,000. $10,000 in negroes, $5000 in Stock and 8000 acres of land -- He owes $10,000 -- </p>
<p>He adds "To releive Mr Johnsons mind I am willing to give him a deed of trust on any or all of my property, for he shall never suffer" -- I give you M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. P<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> statements and leave you to act in the case as you think proper -- I have never seen Mr. Hauly but once, since I conversed with you on the subject of the securityship, and then he was engaged with ladies which prevented me from approaching him</p>
<p>The other case -- Dick Allen, is, I suppose a hopeless case -- I do not care about the principal at present, but the interest due would be acceptable -- <pb/></p>
<p>It is a fact I have been living on borrowed money for five months past, not having received one cent either of principal or interest due me -- </p>
<p>Sometime when you are in town please call in and we will talk about our troubles -- </p>
<p>Mr. Hawkins had not heard anything from <unclear>Neat</unclear> yesterday -- I think he will see such gloomy times in N. O as will induce him to hurry back.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Leonard Wheeler<pb/></p>
