<lb/>Gov T. E. Bramblett
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At an Election held in Harrodsburg on Monday <date when="1865-08-07">7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of August 1865</date>. I was elected Police Judge of Harrodsburg I received my commission and have been sworn in. On wednesday <date when="1865-09-06">6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of ^Sept^ 1865</date> M. V Bowen who is a Policeman came to me, and asked for a warrant against John D Hale who had drawn a pistol on J Roberds I issued the warrant and to day he made the following return. "Not executed because Lieutenant Bishop commanding a company of Negroes in Harrodsburg ordered me not to arrest John D Hale. this <date when="1864-09-08">8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of September 1865"</date></p>
<p>M. V Bowen "J. M. C."<pb/></p>
<p>I send you a copy of the warrant what must I do? Must the Civil give way to the Military Law.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>T. H. Hardin P. J. T H.</p>
<p>P. S. Please let me know by return mail what course I had best persue</p>
<p>T H H,<pb/></p>
<p>Frankfort <date when="1865-09-12">Sept. 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1865</date>
<lb/>Maj Genl Palmer

<p>Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi></p>
<p>I forward you the letter of the police Judge of Harrodsburg together with copy of the wrnt &amp;C<unclear/> J D Hale.</p>
<p>Hale is a bad man -- desperado &amp; suspected of belonging to a band of outlaws. These unlawful and unwarrantable interferences by subordinate officers -- give cause of just complaint; and constitute the material from which capital is made by the rebellious part of the Community. A prompt arrest and and punishment of some of them for such interference with the due and proper course of civil law will remove much of the complaints of the country -- and restore the proper degree of confidence in the authorities of the country</p>
<p>Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Gov of Ky</p>
