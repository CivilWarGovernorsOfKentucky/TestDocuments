<lb/>To His excellency
<lb/>James F. Robinson Governor of Ky -- 
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I take the liberty of addressing you a few lines on the existing State of public affairs -- </p>
<p>The loyal people in the interior of the State find that they are left in the dark as to the course pursued by the authorities of our beloved State -- This is one of the most loyal Counties in the Commonwealth, the people having turned out extensively for the war. and if the policy to be pursued by our military authorities was better defined &amp; more generally understood by our people still more of our people would join the standard of the government. Are the people of the State to be abandoned to be plundered by their foes, in order that the Northern border of the State may be defended? <hi rend="underline">We</hi> think our troops are defending the wrong border. Why invite the enemy to the northern border of our state by concentrating our forces there, leaving the enemy to enjoy the benefits of the immense growing &amp; fresh harvested crops of the State -- If the enemy<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> forces were on our Southern border it would enable us to turn out twice as many men, as we can now do -- We had all better die defending our homes, than to have them desolated by the enemy <hi rend="str">&amp; have</hi> <hi rend="str">them</hi> returned to us after they cease to be of any value. There<pb/>
<lb/>are forces enough in the State to drive the enemy back <hi rend="underline">at</hi> <hi rend="underline">once</hi>. Why let them get a foothold in the State. We are utterly discouraged -- </p>
<p>Another suggestion= I think it will be necessary for you to send officers properly authorized and accredited to every County, before the militia willl come and A Small Company of men sent to a County for a few days to keep down the disloyalists, &amp; enforce the orders would be very effective -- I would add another suggestion:</p>
<p>A Camp of instruction at Louisville would be of very great advantage to the State -- If you would call 25 or 30 intelligent men from every County of the State, and have them thoroughly drilled for some weeks ^I believe^ it would do more to get up the proper military spirit in the State, <hi rend="str">of</hi> than any measure you might adopt</p>
<p>You might take a less number at first and cause them to be surrounded by others -- In the next plan we ought to have more cavalry in Ky than any other description of troops -- Our people are accustomed to horse back exercise &amp; are much better adapted to cavalry than to infantry -- Lastly no Country such as ours can be efficiently defended by an infantry force -- Our public men ought certainly to be convinced of that fairly by this time.</p>
<p>You may well ask why I am staying at home &amp; making suggestions instead of being in the field -- I can only say<pb/>
<lb/>that I have good reasons for remaining <hi rend="str">being</hi> as I am -- I am ready to join any local force at any time &amp; fight if necessary to the bitter end -- To do this effectively the people ought to be prepared by thorough drilling.</p>
<p>I hope you will not take these suggestions as having originated from any spirit of faulty finding, for they certainly do not -- </p>
<p>Excuse me for troubling you with this letter -- It is designed for good -- If I can be of any advantage to you in the way of furnishing <hi rend="str">the</hi> necessary information from here please command me</p>
<p>Very Respy
<lb/>Robt. D. Murray -- </p>
