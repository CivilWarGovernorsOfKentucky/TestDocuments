   <p>To His Excellency -- The Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioners Henly L Crowders and others would respectfully represent that on information of Harrison Thornton and others two indictments were found in the Marion Circuit Court -- one against William Crowders as principal and said H L Crowders and others as aiders on a charge of stabbing said Thornton and the other against William Baxter as principal and others as aiders on a charge of shooting Elizabeth Southerland at the same time at the house of Thornton in Marion County -- William Crowders and Baxter the principals were each separately tried and fined, and on the petitions of themselves and others and evidence furnished Your Excellency's predecessor remitted or respited their fines -- their petitions and evidence on file and referred to -- </p>
<p>Your petitioners further represent that subsequent to the trial of the principals, said Henly T Crowders was tried in each case and in that for stabbing was fined $50 and<pb/>
<lb/>in the other was fined $500 -- He had before been tried by a magistrate and fined $25 for the same offences which he paid -- The $50 and $500 fines remain unpaid -- </p>
<p>They further represent that by the rulings of the Court he was not on either trial <unclear/> the testimony of <hi rend="str">H Crowders or Baxter or of</hi> either of two others indicted with <hi rend="str">t</hi>him -- yet the evidence failed to show that he aided in committing either offence -- and he here states that he did not, but on the contrary being present he endeavored to prevent the others from committing the said acts of violence -- Said Thornton and Southerland have each received renummeration for any injury done them by the settlement of Civil society brought by them -- </p>
<p>Wherefore your petitioners, not believing the judgements authorized or such ^as^ would have been rendered had not said witnesses been excluded by the ruling of the Court and regarding the other facts above recited respectfully ask a remission of said fines of $50 and $500 -- </p>
<p>H. T Crowders<pb/></p>
<p>State of Kentucky
<lb/>Washington County SS -- </p>
<p>Henly T Crowders this day made oath before me to the statements of the foregoing petition -- <date when="1863-03-04">March 4 1863</date>.</p>
