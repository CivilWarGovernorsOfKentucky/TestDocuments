<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Thomas Bramlett, Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I have been shown to day a petition addressed to you, asking for the pardon of George W Miller now confined in your state prison on a conviction for Larceny. I am well acquainted with nearly all the signers and can assure you that they are amongst the most respectable, worthy and intiligent citizens in and about the city of Nashville.</p>
<p>W. K. Turner was for many years Judge of the Criminal court of that city -- Nathaniel Baxter was for many years Judge of the Circuit Court for the Nashville district -- P. W Maxey was several terms Mayor of the city -- W. Mat. Brown was formerly United States Marshall for the District of Middle Tennessee -- while all the balance are men of good character &amp; high standing in that community</p>
<p>I give full credit to the statements in the petition, and most earnestly join in soliciting the pardon of George W Miller.</p>
<p>The good character &amp; high respectability of the Morther &amp; father &amp; family, appeals strongly in<pb/>
<lb/>favour of pardoning a youthful son, whose crime ^arose^ from the intoxicating draft, or by the imposition of an artful &amp; experienced scoundrel. I again entreat your Excellency to give the petition a favourable consideration</p>
<p>With sincere regard
<lb/>I am your friend &amp; obt. svt.</p>
<p>W B Campbell<pb/></p>
<p>Governor Campbells
<lb/>Letter -- </p>
