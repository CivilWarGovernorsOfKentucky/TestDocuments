   <p>To His Excellency T E Bramlett
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>Your petitioners Davis Bottom and others Citizens of Washington County repsectfully represent that at the <date when="1863-05">May Term 1863</date> of the Washington Circuit Court an Indictment was found against said Bottom charging the offense of unlawfully selling whiskey to a slave on which he was tried at the <date when="1863-11">Nov term 1863</date> and a verdict and judgment rendered against him for a fine of $50 -- He filed grounds for a new trial which the court held under advisement till near the close of the <date when="1864-05">May term 1864</date> when the motion was overruled and leave given to prepare the case for the court of appeals, by the next <date when="--10">Oct Term -- </date></p>
<p>It was proven on the trial by a single witness that said Bottoms occupied a house in Maxwell of several rooms with a family of several persons including a negro woman and that the witness with others procured a slave named Ned to go into the house in the night and that he (Ned) returned to them with whiskey, but there was no proof that Deft or any of his family furnished the whiskey or know of the negros entering the house -- Said Bottoms now states that was not guilty of said offence and knows not by what means the<pb/>
<lb/>the slave obtained the whiskey if attall</p>
<p>Your petitioners represent said Bottom to be a law abiding, although a very poor man and believing the verdict and judgment to have been wrong and not authorized by the evidence and moreover that the case is a proper one for the interposition of the Executive we respectfully ask a remission of said fine</p>

<p>I believe the foregoing case is one that justifies the intervention of executive clemency</p>

<p>I do not know any thing about the facts of the case but would be glad to see Mr Bottoms released of the fine</p>

<p>I was counsel for Bottoms on the trial and the petition fairly states the evidence according to my recollection -- I join in the prayer for a remission of the fine</p>
