   <p>Petition of J Pillsbury
<lb/>(Copy.)
<lb/>To the Gen. Assembly of the State of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Your petitioner, J. Pillsbury was employed by the Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">n</hi></hi> appointed by the Governor in <date when="1858">1858</date> to run &amp; remark the boundary line between this State and the State of Tennessee, and served in the capacity of engineer under said employment seven months, when his health gave out and he was compelld in consequence to quit the line.</p>
<p>The com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">n</hi></hi> reported $2100 due for his services subject to a credit of $70 paid by com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> C. M. Briggs. The Gen. Assembly approprited on the <date when="1860-02-28">28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of February 1860</date> $980 toward the payment of the $2100 due your petitioner which with the $70 previously paid made $1050. On the <date when="1867-12-18">18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi rend="str">Febru</hi>Dec. 1867</date> the Gen. Assembly appropriated $1050 to pay the balance of the $2100. Thus you will see I was Kept out of $1050 justly due seven years, nine months, and twenty days. I now ask this Gen. Assembly to appropriate $491<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">75</hi></hi> to pay the interest on $1050 withheld for the period of 7 years, nine months, and 20 days. I have made continual efforts since the first appropriation in <date when="1860">1860</date>. to have justice down in the premises, but without success.</p>
