<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>We the undersigned Jurors who were empanelled at the <date when="1863-09">September Term of the Webster Circuit Court for 1863</date> to try Elijah Hayden upon an indictment which charged said Hayden of fellony Would respectfully Represent to your Honor that said charge was only sustained by the confession of the accused and that we are satisfied and believe that under ordinary circumstances the accused would never have commited any fellony or have been guilty of any crime and that What he done was more for the sake of self preservation then for gain or peculation</p>
<p>Where fore We in connection with <hi rend="str">with</hi> the Judge who tried the cause and those who gave the information would respectfully ask of your excelency that <hi rend="str">that</hi> the said Elijah Hayden be granted a reprieve and that your Honor will pardon the accused and<pb/>
<lb/>that he be permitted to return to his family wherefore we will ever pray</p>
