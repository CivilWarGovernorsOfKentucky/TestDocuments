<lb/>Governor M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin</p>
<p>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir An application will be made by the friends of F Hock to you for the exorcise of Executive Clemancy to release said Hock from the payment of a $50<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> fine and imprisonment ^imposed^ by a judgement of Kenton Circuit Court You will see from a statement of the case signed by nearly if not all of the jury who tried him that he was much provoked to do what he done besides he is a poor honest industrious German has a good class of Family connection who are also not well affluent stand very high in this City<pb/>
<lb/>He is utterly unable to pay the fine and to keep him incarcerated in jail any longer at the expense of the <hi rend="str">public</hi> County under the circumstances would be I do think not required to subserve the end of justice I hope your Excellency will grant the prayer of said Hock</p>
<p>Yours Respectfully
<lb/>R K Sumerwell</p>
