<lb/>My Dear Sir.</p>
<p>I had hoped to meet you here to-day in behalf of an unfortunate Irishman recently convicted to the State Prison from the City of Louisville, Patrick M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Dermott. His mother who is an industrious &amp; honest woman has importuned me to intercede for his pardon but I informed her that I could only call your attention to the petition presented by her some two weeks ago &amp; beg your respectful consideration of it. I believe they have also furnished you a transcript of the record in the case &amp; a statement of the exidence. The offense is certainly very slight for the punishment awarded and I have ascertained that the young man has been an honest, industrious &amp; good citizen until the sad and unfortunate difficulty which has involved<pb/>
<lb/>him in this last deplorable trouble. </p>
<p>I trust, Governor, you may find it convenient with that discretion belonging to your high Office to extend to the poor boy your precious pardon. And you in so doing but an act of justice, will make a now distraught Mother very happy and oblige</p>
<p>Yours truly,
<lb/>Geo. C. Drane</p>
<p>To Gov James F. Robinson</p>
<p>P. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Dermot

<lb/>George Dranes letter</p>
