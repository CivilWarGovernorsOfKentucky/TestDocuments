<lb/>dear sir!</p>
<p>The Citizens of Covington have brought up a Petition for to raise a battailion of sharpshoo<hi rend="str">t</hi>ters for 12 Months service, organizet by Fred T. Walker. This Petition has been handet to the Hon. John. F. Fisk, which they hope is presentet to the Hon. Military board of Ky. Such battailion (of 5 Comp.) will be brought up in very short time, and can be moved in co-operation with cavalrie very quickly. The Citizens like to hear soon of it, and I ask your honour, what y shall do. It is nothing better as such smal battailion agains thos Guilliras and y hope that your honour will have the kindness to do somting for it. y have been formely in the Prussian army and have seen battles; several young mens are here, who are williing to defend our State. Y ask your honour as soon as possible for a answer, for what y will very obligate to you.</p>
