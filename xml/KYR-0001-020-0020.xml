   <p>To 
<lb/>His Excellency Beriah Maggoffin Governor of The Commonwealth of Kentucky=</p>
<p>We the undersigned, citizens of Caldwell County Ky. have long known Thomas. B. Wadlington &amp; he has ever been considered, a good &amp; true hearted citizen Known &amp; noted for his industry &amp; his orderly and peaceable conduct. The difficulty in which he was engaged with Milton A Cartwright did not appear to us to be of his seeking. Nor are we satisfied that the case was fairly presented to the Jury as it really occured. We hope your Excellency will review the case &amp; give the poor man the benefit -- of every doubt -- and we <hi rend="str">or</hi> desire,, that his case, may be judged in mercy &amp; regarded with favor. And that your Excellency will take into consideration every circumstance, that ought to operate in his behalf. And we desire that your Excellency may be persuaded, that it is consistent with yr duty to extend to him Executive Clemency, and that his life may be spared either by a full pardon or by a commutation of his punishment. <date when="1861-01-22">Jany 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 1861</date>.</p>
