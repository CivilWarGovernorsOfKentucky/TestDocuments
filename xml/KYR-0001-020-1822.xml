   <p>Mason Circuit Court. 
<lb/>Commonwealth of 
<lb/>Kentucky 
<lb/>vs
<lb/>Throckmorton Forman</p>
<p>We have been requested to state the facts and circumstances, which transpired, when this case was disposed of in Court. The defendant was indicted for shooting John Chambers in sudden heat and passion. Defendant and Chambers were young and very closely related -- being own cousins. J C Hickman, attorney for Forman, and R H Stanton, Commonwealth's Attorney, thought it would be advisable, in view of all the circumstances, to adjust this trouble without a trial before a Jury. Chambers and Forman were both consulted by the attorneys, and Chambers and Forman, both being present in Court, the case was submitted to Court -- with plea of guilty -- confessed -- and the Court adjudged a fine of 50$, which, of course, carried the costs.
