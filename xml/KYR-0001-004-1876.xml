They stoped at the house of a M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

Howard and Clark both entered the Army of the United States, and when the Cause was called at the <date when="1864-11">November Term, 1864,</date> of the Muhlenburg Circuit Court, a forfeiture of the bail-bond was entered, and at the<pb/>
<lb/>&amp; at the <date when="1865-05">May Term, 1865,</date> of this Court a Judgment was rendered against them, and an execution ordered to be issued. They desire to state farther that Carroll L. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cown one of your petitioners was drafted <hi rend="str">&amp;</hi> in <date when="1864-09">sep<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.
