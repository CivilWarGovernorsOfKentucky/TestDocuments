   <p>EXECUTIVE OFFICE,
<lb/>Madision, Wis., <date when="1861-07-04">July 4th, 1861</date>.
<lb/>To His Excellency,
<lb/>The Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>It seems to be assumed that the moment one of our citizens enlists as a soldier in the service of the United States, he loses to a certian extent his citizienship, and that he is entitled to but little further consideration. This has been at all times an inhuman error, but at this time it is doubly so. The men who have enlisted as soldiers in the present war have not done so for pay of the soldier, nor because they were out of employment. The men who fill the armies of the United States to-day, enlisted with the patriotic purpose of putting down a wicked rebellion, and maintaining the integrity of the Federal Government. They are our neighbors and fellow-citizens, who, braver than we are, go to endure the privations of the camp, and to brave the dangers of the battle-field, not only for thermselves, but for us. From Wisconsin -- and I doubt not the same may be said of all loyal States -- all classes and conditions of men, men of all the professions and avocations and employments of life, swell the ranks of our Regiments. There is scardely a soldier but leaves behind him a family or social circle broken by his absence. In every conceivable way they make great sacrifices. They carry the honor of their respective States with them, and are pledged to uphold that honor, as well as to punish rebellion. They are entitled to our greatest consideration and care. Whoever defrauds a patriotic, liberty-loving, government-loving soldier, is a thief. So far as possible, the several States should do, and are doing, all in their power to send their Regiments forward well uniformed and proved for the service in which they are to engage. I feel impelled to submit that the duties of the authorities of the several States toward the stalwart-hearted men who go to do our battles for us, do not and cannot end here. The history of all wars tells us that both during their continuance and after their close, thousands of soldiers sick and diseased and maimed, go wandering homeward, suffering with privation and want, begging their weary way, and meeting that curious public gaze, which has no sympathy or kindness in it. Each State has a rich reversionary interest in the citizen soldiers who represent it, and each State owes to itself and to every soldier, an obligation to take care of that interest.</p>
<p>I have determined, in behalf of Wisconsin, to send with each Regiment, men whose sole business it shall be to stay with the Regiment, look after its welfare, and to see that every man who, from sickness or the casualties of war, becomes so far disabled that he can no longer endure the fatigues or perform the duties of the camp or field, shall be safely and comfortably returned to this State, and to his familiy or friends. In health or sickness, in triumph or defeat, these men are ours and our country's and our obligations and hopes equally go with them. May I invite you to co-operate in this movement? The agents appointed by and for the several States, for these purposes, can, to a very large extent, act in concert, and aid each other. I cannot doubt but that by a proper effort, all Railroad and Steamboat Companies, touched by the humanity of the object, can be induced to pass all disabled persons free, upon a certificate from the proper responsible authority, that as such they were honorably discharged from service. The expense will be comparatively light and the good to result, incalculable.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully,
<lb/>Alex, W, Randall<pb/></p>
<p>Gov Randall of Wisconsin</p>
