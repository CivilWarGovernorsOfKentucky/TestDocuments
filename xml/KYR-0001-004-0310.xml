   <p>L. A. WOOD
<lb/>ATTORNEY AT LAW,
<lb/>LOUISVILLE, KY.
<lb/>OFFICE NO. 15 COURT PLACE.
<lb/>Louisville, Ky <date when="1865-02-23">Feby 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 1865</date>
<lb/>His Excellency Gov. Thos. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort Ky
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>As I was conizant of all the facts and circumstances in the case of Wm Schofield from his arrest up to his conviction, I deem it proper, to State <hi rend="str">that</hi> without going into a detailed account of the facts &amp; circumstances, that they were wholy inSufficient in my opinion to establish his guilt. I was his counsel up until he told me that he was going to plead guilty. He Still told me that he was not guilty; but Said he had rather plead guilty and get, (as he hoped by pleading guilty he would) only one year, than to lie in Jail until the next term of the court.</p>
<p>I talked with his witness Some time before the trial, and if they could have been got there, I think beyond a doubt that there testimony would have insured an acquittal. But they had, Some of them left the State and others of them we did not know where they were; and he Said rather than lie in jail to the next court he would plead guilty. I then refused to defend him; and did not defend him on the trial. I have no contingent fee in this case; nor am I to be benefitted a farthing by his being pardoned. But I never did believe he Stole<pb/></p>
<p>the money; and I do not believe that the public <unclear/> requires that he Should be retained in Prison. And as it would So rejoice the hearts of his distressed mother and the whole family I do hope you will pardon him</p>
<p>Yours Truly
<lb/>L..A. Wood</p>
