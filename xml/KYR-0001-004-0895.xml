   <p>To His Excellency Gov Bramlette</p>
<p>Your petitioners Robt P Pepper states that he recently had a difficulty - with John B Lindsey &amp; upon trail before John R Graham Police Judge of Frankfort on Saturday <date when="--05-14">May 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> he was fined $20 for a breach of the peace and upon another warrant he was fined $50 for carrying a concealed deadly weapon</p>
<p>Petitioner does not ask or desire a remission of the $20 fine but he does ask a remission of the $50 fine. He is not in the habit generally of carrying deadly weapons but in these troubled times he regards it as a right that every citizen has to carry weapons</p>
<p>Very Respectfully,
<lb/>R P Pepper <pb/></p>
<p>City of Frankfort 
<lb/>vs</p>
<p>Having remitted every case of concealed weapons presented since the rebellion upon the principle that during the rebellion every loyal man should be priveleged to carry weapons 
<lb/>I order the remission except fees and costs</p>
<p>Thos E Bramlette</p>
<p>R. P. Pepper
<lb/>Concealed Weapon</p>
