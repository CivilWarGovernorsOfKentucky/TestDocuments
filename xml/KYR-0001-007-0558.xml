<lb/>Dear Brown</p>
<p>Charley Hanson promised me to write to-day in my behalf to Gov. Bramlette for the appointment of Notary Public for this county.</p>
<p>Lest he might forget it, I ask the same favor at your hands; i.e. that you will see the Gov. for me, (I am not acquainted with him, nor does he know aught of so humble an individual) and request him to appoint me to the before-mentioned position, not forgetting to enumerate all and singular the immense benefits &amp; advantages which would accrue therefrom to the citizens of the town &amp; county aforesaid.<pb/>
<lb/>I have been appointed "<hi rend="underline">Examiner</hi>" for this County and, as fit occasion or opportunity may arise, shall be happy to serve you in that or any other capacity your legal or other exigencies may demand.</p>
<p>If I have any friends in the city of Frankfort, (save &amp; except yourself, whom I account it as a privilege to hold as such) please "under these assurances of viz distinguished consideration." If you will <hi rend="underline">promptly</hi> attend to my little matter for me you will greatly oblige</p>
<p>Yr sincere friend
<lb/>Tho. J. Elliott.</p>
<p>P. S. Dick Vance got his license last week to practice law: makes Bowling Green his arena I understand. E.<pb/></p>
