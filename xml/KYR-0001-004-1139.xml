   <p>His Excellency Gov. Bramlette</p>
<p>Your Petitioner T. J Johnson Says that he was fined $60 -- for keeping a Tipling house, by the Laurel Circuit Court, at its present <date when="--08">August</date> Term. He says that he plead guilty, But he says that he believed at the time he was not violating the law, but that he had a right to sell spirits -- He says that he had procured a Licinse from the General Government to distill spirits, and he believed that he had a right by virtue of said licence to sell the same in any quantity he thought proper, if he had not been so informed, and if he had not so believed he should not have sold the spirits for which he was indicted &amp; fined -- He says that he is poor, and the fine &amp; costs will be very oppressive on him, he therefore prays that the said fine be remitted</p>
