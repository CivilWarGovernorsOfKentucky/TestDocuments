   <p>To his Excellency Thos E. Bramlette Governor of the State of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioners H. M. Still and S. M. Campbell would respectfully state that at the present <date when="--09">September</date> term of the Nicholas Circuit Court a judgement was rendered against them in favor of the Commonwealth for Sixty Dollars for keeping a tippling house. They state that they made application for license to keep a tavern at their house in Carlisle, and paid the money to Jno. A. Campbell then clerk of the Nicholas County Court and never knew but what the order had been made until a Indictment was returned against them in Court. They immediately made application and took out license. They acted in good faith and with no intention of violating the law believing that the order granting them license had been made. They refer to the statement below of W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Norvell Esqr who was at that time County Judge of Nicholas County They pray that your Excellency will interpose and remit said fine
<lb/><date when="1863-09">September 1863</date></p>
<p>H. M. Still
<lb/>L. M. Campbell</p>
<p>I think this ought to be remitted</p>
<p>Geo M Thomas
<lb/>Att for Comth 
<lb/>10<hi rend="underline">th</hi> District</p>
<p>I cheerfully recommend this Petition</p>
<p>W Norvell</p>
<p>I was Judge of the Nicholas County Court, at the time specified in the above petition, and I recollect that Mr. Still applied to me in vacation, for License for the Tavern of Still and Campbell -- and I told him to go to the office, pay the Clerk &amp; tell him to prepare a bond, and I would at any time open Court and grant the License. I suppose the matter was afterward inadvertently omitted by the Clerk and Mr. Still.</p>

<lb/>Govr. Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I am quite sure that it will be highly proper exercise of Executive Clemency to remit the fine imposed by Law on Messer Still &amp; Campbell. The State received the Remit &amp; all was intended correct and the county Judge &amp; Clerk more to believe than they I hope you well remit this fine</p>
<p>You truly
