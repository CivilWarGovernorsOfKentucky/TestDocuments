   <p>State of Kentucky, County of Franklin towit.
<lb/>To his Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette.</p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully State that John O. Stigers was fined by the Franklin circuit court, in the year <date when="1864">1864</date> Sixty dollars as we are informed, for retailing liquor without, license. He alleges that he made application to Judge Swigert for license, and was advised by him not to take them out. Accordingly he did not, and sold out his barrel of whiskey &amp; moved off to the State of Indiana. His health has become feeble, and he is now old &amp; infirm and can but illy spare the money to pay the fine, and your petitioners are of opinion that it would be a charitable act to remit Said fine, or rather that portion of it that is due to the Commonwealth. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray &amp;C.</p>
