<lb/>H H Smith Esq<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
<lb/>Frankfort Ky</p>
<p>Dear friend I have just now learned by a friend that Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Wadlington &amp; James M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goodwin of Princeton have gone to Frankfort with a view of making intercession for the unfortunate F. B. Wadlington who is under sentence of death for the murder of Cartwright. The people of Hopkins as well as those of Caldwell County are strongly impressed with the belief that the conviction of T. B. Wadlington is unjust and based wholy upon false Testimony.. that W killed Cartwright we have no doubt, but that he did it in self defence &amp; that he was shot first we have not a solitary dout In consequence of this we have gotten petitioners in this county numbering about six hundred, and will send them tomorrow morning by private hand to Princeton and from these will endeavor to have them sent on by express to his Excellency Gov M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin We therefore ask you to inform the Governor. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goodwin, &amp; Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Wadlington of -- the fact, that our Petitions will reach there in a few days and to give them time to arrive before pressing the Governor to a decision in the case</p>
<p>We think we see the right spirit and feeling manifested by our Ky Legislature. such as will teach both the extreme North &amp; South, that Ky stand as she has ever stood true &amp; Loyal to the Union. Hopking you will have good health we subscribe ourselves</p>
<p>Your friends truly
<lb/>Geo W Noel
<lb/>Joseph Fuquay</p>
<p>N B
<lb/>If you can say any thing in favor our unfortunate Wadlingtons case to Gov M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin do so. You a least can say truly that you<pb/>
<lb/>are acquainted with many of the petitioners and testify as to their character &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>N. &amp;. F.</p>
