   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>Thos. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Gov. of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners Jesse Denham, William Laylin, Alx T. Card, Lee Laforce Joshua Faulkner D. W. Carrol James Cutbirth, would most respectfully State that they stand (each) indicted in the Whitley Circuit Court charged with the offence of Selling Liquor to minors</p>
<p>They most positively and truthfully say that at the time the Liquor was sold they did not know it was a violation of the Law. There attention had never been called to the Act of the Legislature</p>
<p>They further state that they were not in the habit of selling to small Boys or youths on the contrary it was against their rules to sell to Boys or youths. The persons who got liquor from them and for which the Indictments were made, are all grown up, and apparently men of mature age, one of them was a Licensed Practicing Lawyer. The others had been soldiers in the Federal Army And they had every reason <hi rend="str">to</hi> to believe that they were men acting for themselves.</p>
<p>They say that they are opposed to the selling Liquor to minors and will not<pb/>
<lb/>again be engaged in this trade</p>
<p>The premises considered they most respectfully ask Your Excellency to Pardon the above offence.</p>

<lb/>Dear Governor</p>
<p>I am satisfied the facts are correctly stated in the Petition I Know all the men they are good citizens, and not violaters of Law. The gentleman Geo. B. Lyttle to whome they sold Liquor and for which they are indicted, has all the appearance of a man of 21 years. Believing him to be 21 years old. I signed his Liscens as an Atty: the same week, that He got the Liquor for which the Petitioners stand indicted &amp; I believe they should be pardoned</p>
