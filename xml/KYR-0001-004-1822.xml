   <p>To His excellency Thomas. E Bramlet
<lb/>Govenor of The Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioners George Wallace &amp; John Wilson citizens of Boyd County Ky do represent to your excellency, that they were indicted in the Boyd Circuit Court. for shooting at James Wilson with intent to hit him but of which he was not shot. that at the <date when="1865-04">April term 1865</date> now sitting of said Court, they were fined each one hundred Dollars and costs. They say that the proof was that they were passing along the road and were a little under the influence of liquor and as they passed by Wiliam's house the dogs were out &amp; Wallace shot at the dog. &amp; after some altercation with Williams Wallace again shot. they say that there was no proof of any shooting by Wilson. They were then privates in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Reg of Vol. and have behaved themselves and made good soldiers for over three years and until they were mustered out. except this unfortunate affair for which they are extremely sorry &amp; will in future do better and be law abiding men. Said Wilson Says that he is a poor man with a wife and a large family of children<pb/>
<lb/>and he is unable to repley the fine and has to go to Jail and his family Wants his labor and care. They therefore ask your excellency to interpose and for this once grant them relief by a remission and stay of the penalties inflicted so far as you can.</p>
<p>John Wilson
<lb/>George Wallace</p>
<p>We citizens of Boyd County concur in the preyer of the petitioner. We have learned from proof we do not doubt. that they were good soldiers and orderly on all occasions except this affair Wilson is a poor man with a large family, and we ask he may be permitted to go <unclear>home</unclear> to take care of them</p>
<p>D T Moore
<lb/>John M Burns for Wilson<pb/></p>
<p>From my knowledge of the case I would say that the facts are as stated; &amp; in consideration of the said facts, &amp; further, that they have been faithful soldiers, &amp; served their time out, &amp; this is their only offece, I am disposed to say that they deserve clemency on your hands</p>
