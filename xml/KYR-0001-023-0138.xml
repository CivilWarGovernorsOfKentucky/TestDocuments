<p>To the Honorable Beriah Magoffin govenor of the state of Kentucky Sir in the name and by the request of what I believe to be a large majority of the peacable and law abiding voters of this county that I address you to know by what authority that certain men in our county say that they are empowered by authority from one Jerry Boyle of this state said to be Milatary governor of this state not to allow any men to be a candidate for any office <hi rend="str">only</hi> accept such as may be selected by the so called union party of this state and by this authority in our county two gentleman <hi rend="str">h</hi>who are candidates has been informed that unless they are willing to act with the so called union <hi rend="str">county</hi> party that they must retire from the canvass and if they fail to comply with the mandate why they are assured that they will be arrested and sent to Camp Chase now sir in the name of the constitution and the laws ^of^ our state we most Solemnly protest against this usurpation of power by which the last vestage of our political freedom at the ballot box and our constitutional rights as freemen of the great state of Kentucky is swept away from <hi rend="str">f</hi>the people and now sir we appeal to you who was elected the chief magistrate of this state to see that the laws was faithfullly carried out and that all the rights guranteed to the citazen by the constitution and the laws of the state shall be respected so far as in your power it can be done and we earnestly hope that you will take this momentious question under consideration and inform the people by proclamation whether or not they have got to give up all these constitutional and legal rights as citozens and submit to a military despotism for the present now sir in conclusion we assure you we will even protest against such usurpation of power as is now attemted to be carried out in relation to our elections by the so called union party of this state </p>
