   <p>Maysville Ky. <date when="1865-05-09">May 9th 1865</date>
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>A day or two ago I signed a petition to have Reuben S. Darnall <hi rend="str">up</hi> Commissioned to raise a Company of active militia in this County under your Call for state troops. Since then I have learned some things which satisfies me that the appointment would be injudicious, at least I would advise or request you to hold the appointment up, until you hear further about the matter. We are getting along here very well and there appears to be a scattering of the rebels &amp; guerillas at present, that will in this part of the state, at least, do away with the necessity of Calling out a Company from this County. And, should there be a necessity, I think our worthy Mayor Can be induced to take Charge of a Company and if he will, he will give <hi rend="str">more</hi> entire Satisfaction and security to the people. Mr Darnall, I think, too young for such an important position besides, he has been Connected I understood with negro recruiting, which you know would to a great extent paralyze his usefullness</p>
<p>Yours truly
<lb/>Robt A Cochran</p>
<p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thos E. Bramlette Gov. Ky.<pb/></p>

<p>Writes that he signed a petition <hi rend="str">petition</hi> some time since, recommending Reuben S. Darnall as a suitable person to raise a company of Active Militia, but thinks now that the appointment would be injudicious, and suggests that it be withheld as guerillas are disbanding, don't think it necessary to have a company in Mason.<figure type="hr"/></p>
