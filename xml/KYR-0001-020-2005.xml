   <p>To His Excellency B. Magoffin Gov. of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens and residents of Fleming County respectfully state that at the <date when="1862-03">March term of the Fleming Circuit Court in the year 1862</date> Charles Summers was fined fifty dollars on an Indictment for carrying concealed a deadly weapon That Summers is a peaceable, inoffensive man not given ^to^ brawls and quarrels, but altogether a good citizen_ He had been told that some persons with whom he had some misunderstanding -- intended to use violence towards him; and through fear, no doubt, armed himself with a pistol -- and was under some foolish provocation -- induced to Speak of having a pistol; and to exhibit it to sustain his word -- controverted perhaps by some humourous aquaintances who provoked him for their amusement -- we are Sure that Summers would hardly use a weapon under any circumstances -- and ask in consideration of the facts and his harmless character that your Excellency will exercise you authority in his behalf and remit the fine adjudged against him. <date when="1862-06-10">June 10<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> 1862.</date></p>
