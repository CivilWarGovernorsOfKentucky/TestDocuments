   <p>South Carrolton. Ky.
<lb/><date when="1864">10<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> 1864</date>.
<lb/>Gov: Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi>. E. Bramlette.</p>
<p>Your Excellency must be the recipient of another letter from me in regard to county men armed and equiped by the state. Since the denial of your Excellency to me, of the permit to raise these men, Sebastian C. Vick claiming to be commissioned by yourself (though in what way I am not aware of) has gone forward in the work of raising a regiment of men <hi rend="underline">for the county</hi>; And, has been acting out the most complete military force that has come to pass during this war. He, After recruiting about fifty or sixty men, goes through a Sham organization, -- himself being elected as 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> Lieu<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> under a man by the name of Lewis ^as Captain^ after enjoying the bombastic fuminations of <hi rend="underline">Colonel</hi> in abeyance for two months and better. The reason I write to you concerning this, is because I think (in common with several other trustworthy and responsible men) that Col<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">n</hi></hi> Vick is acting contrary to law, without any shadow of authority, I send you inclosed an original proclamation of his, that he diffused throughout the county. I applied for the authority simply, to raise a hundred men, and was referred. I afterwards thought it was because your Excellency saw its incompatibility with Government relations and plans. That this new military basis would be too independent of the one already established in the<pb/>
<lb/>State. The smaller <hi rend="underline">one</hi> proving a failure on account of the precedence of the larger -- as the larger has to operate in the state. Furthermore, that the General Government will have her suspicions of all such independent organizations in the border slave states on account of her experience in the past.</p>
<p>Your Excellency is fully aware that a body of sixty men quartered in one vicinity without any visible means of support, but that, they gain by extortion must be a great burthen to a people belonging to a single district. For when rations are not regularly issued out to men, they will destroy twice as much as they consume. The cost then, that the support of these men would come to, in an irregular method of feeding, <hi rend="str">C</hi>would be safely estimated at one=Hundred= and fifty thousand dollars, with the contingent expenses of a soldiery (provided as these are) included as a matter of course.</p>
<p>For these men incorporated by. Vick belong to the irresponsible class of the county. as it is, they have provided themselves with horses, arms, and food by impressment so far. </p>
<p>When they grow older in the practice of impressing, and begin to feel they have authority for the step they have taken, the aggravation will grow tenfold worse. A vast amount of civil injuries your Excellency knows will grow out of this thing. I dont think your Excellency will countenance anything that has a tendency to undermine the law. That, while we are prosecuting this war, it would stand us in hand to do it,<pb/>
<lb/>At least, under the shadow of the law. And, by this manner of prosecuting the war, make those who cried there is no law -- no union, feel the reality of both. No doubt, the perpetuity of our Government rests altogether in such a resolution.</p>
<p>The plan I proposed had some military dignity about it. Not the gathering together of an idle and reckless class going about over the county and getting their living off the industrious class of citizens.</p>
<p>This representation and the proclamation herein contained will enlighten you sufficiently with regard to this case.</p>
<p>If Sebastian, C, Vick has authority from your Excellency for this step I have not a word to say. My object is, to enlighten you with regard to his movements. Even if he has authority from you; I cannot, but think, that you are deceived in his ability.</p>
<p>Respectfully,
<lb/>W. H. Faris,</p>
<p>N. B. I forgot to state that Vick is quartered at this place, and expects to remain here until he gets his out in toto, from Bowlingreen,<pb/></p>
