<lb/>Hon. Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. E. Bramlett
<lb/>Governor of Ky
<lb/>Frankfort,
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We tak- great pleasure in recommending our friend Col. Arthur F. Dobyn to executive clemency, he having been fined at the last term of our court, for permitting gaming on his premises, Col. D -- is a man of <unclear>evasive</unclear> social qualities, and all these were proven against him mostly made out a technichal case; that is three gentlemen, his neighbors, visiting at his house, played games<pb/>
<lb/>of cards for amusement, having small stakes, to keep the games, There was no intention or thought of violating any law, or of gaming, as it turned, a mere pastime, to while away the hours -- His punishment will be severe enough, in compelling him to pay costs, and the atty's part of the fine,</p>
<p>We would esteem it a favour to us personally, and we believe the demands of the law, would be fully satisfied, if you would remit this extremely onerous fines under the circumstances</p>
<p>most resp'y your
<lb/>ob't serv't,
<lb/><hi rend="underline">Stanton &amp; Throop</hi></p>
