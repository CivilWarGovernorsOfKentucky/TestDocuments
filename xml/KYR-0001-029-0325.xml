   <p>To your Excellency James F. Robbinson
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky,</p>
<p>The undersigned would respectfully represent to your excellency that G. F. Gallion was arrested at Demossville in Pendleton County Ky, about the <date when="1861-08-01">1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> of August 1861</date>, under the charge of attempting to shoot a certain Allen H. W. Luks with intent to kill, After the case was heard the examining Court held the said Gallion to <unclear/> in the sum of two hundred dollars, for his appearance on the first day of the next <date when="--10">October</date> term of the Pendleton Circuit Court, Afterward said Gallion, who is a loyal citizen entered into the service of the Union Army, and was absent at the said <date when="--10">October</date> Term, in consequence of which the bond was forfeited against him and his sureties, John L. Wilson, Alan Bradley, A. L. Caldwell, L. M. Carlisle, &amp; Wm. A. Vandever, but no judgment has yet been rendered against them but the case stands on a summons against the bail, and judgment will be rendered against them without the interposition of your excellency, The undersigned also state that the sureties above named are all loyal citizens of the United States, and are poor men, and the undersigned believe, that it would be just and right to relieve them of the entire penalty of said bond, under the circumstances of the case as herein set forth, They further represent that they would not solicit this favor of your Excellency under any other state of case, where they believed there was no just grounds for executive clemency,</p>
