<lb/>Gov. Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort
<lb/>My Dear Sir</p>
<p>My son Patrick White is now confined in the penitentiary having sent from the Campbell Cir. Co. in <date when="1862-02">February 1862</date> for an alleged rape upon one Elizabeth Franklin.</p>
<p>A petition signed by all the jurors who were living at the time it was obtained &amp; statement, showing conclusively that the boy was convicted by ^the^ perjury of the girl and asking for his release were sent up during the adminsitration of Gov. Robinson but I think the Governor never acted upon these in addition to this I can now<pb/>
<lb/>obtain a petition by Wm E Arthir Esq who prosecuted the case: The object of this letter is to know whether your Excellency will under the usages of your department give the case a consideration or whether you consider yourself concluded by his action already had by Gov. R. - When at Frankfort the other day I noticed that the petition &amp; statements refered to were not on file and I am induced to believe that Gov. R. has never had the case in any proper manner before him</p>
