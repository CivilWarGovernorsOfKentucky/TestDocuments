<lb/>Gov T E Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>A Judgment was sometime since rendered by the Hart Equity &amp; Criminal Court in favor of the Comth vs Samuel Mansfield, and W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> B Thompson for one hundred dollars ($100,,) &amp; costs, on a forfeited Bailbond. Thompson having been the bail of Mansfield who was Indicted for some misdemeanor.</p>
<p>I have Just returned from the Hart Court, and while there this information was given me by several reliable gentlemen, towit.</p>
<p>That Mansfield is insolvent, having been broken ^up^ by endorsing the notes of others. That Thompson who is a poor man will have the Judgment to pay. That at the term of the Court at which the forfeiture of the bond was entered<pb/>
<lb/>Mansfields wife was sick and he could not leave her. This part was not known then to the court or atty for the Comth. At the next term of the Court, at which Judgment was rendered, on the bond, the atty for Mansfield was absent from the Court, and the defense which he desired to have made was not made, and Judgt rendered by default. Mansfield is quite an ignorant man particularly as to legal matters. From the information which I have I <hi rend="str">a</hi> believe he could have made a substantial defense; Under the Circumstances I think it would be right for the executive to interpose, and at the suggestion of friends<pb/>
<lb/>from whom I have obtained these parts I address you in behalf of Messrs Mansfield &amp; Thompson, without forwarding a petition.</p>
<p>If you remit Please send the remission to the clerk of the Hart Circuit Court Munfordville Ky.</p>
<p>Respectfully &amp;c
