<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E. Bramblett,
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Major J M Thomas proposed to apply to you for a pardon, in a criminal prosecution in this court, and I take great pleasure in stating, that I am intimately acquainted with him as a neighbor, and that he is a gentleman of excellent moral character, &amp; unimpeached honour. From my knowledge of Major Thomas, I am sure that he would not be guilty of any act which he did not beleive to be conscientiously right and proper. From a personal knowledge of a large portion of his service in the confederate army as captain of cavalry, I know of no officer whose conduct was more exemplary &amp; honourable. I know nothing of the facts of the case in which he is charged, but his own statement is worthy of all credit.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully 
<lb/><hi rend="underline">R. Hawes</hi><pb/></p>
<p>His Exc'y
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. E Bramblett
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
  </body>
