<lb/>Hon B. Magoffin 
<lb/>Gov. of Kentucky } Respected Sir</p>
<p>A Petition to pardon John Singer colered man of this place who is accused of going to Cincinnati &amp; returning to this ^city^ in violation of Law is about being sent you. I would be glad if you would grant his petition. I have known John some ten or twelve years, &amp; have known him as one of the most qu<hi rend="str">e</hi>iet peacable, person of the town He may have violated the Law but the Law has never been enforced in this place &amp; in the great disturbance in our country &amp; the total disregard of Law in high places it might be nice not to be too rigid in emforcing a law with such a severe penalty on this poor man &amp; family. I hope he will have the benefit of your clemency -- </p>
<p>I am Sir your Obedt, Servt.
