<lb/>Frankfort -- Ky -- 
<lb/>Gov -- </p>
<p>In <date when="1862-03">March 1862</date>, We Holloway &amp; Burton Merchants of this Place determined to send a Branch of our House to London Laurel County Ky -- We got one of our old clerks to go &amp; take charge of said Branch Store W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> M. Stone therefore went there with an invoice of several Thousand dollars worth Goods -- and opened them in the best room he could rent in the Town of London, The Merchants of that place being interested in our not locating there Combined and he was forced to take at an Enormous rent the room he opened out his goods in, hoping to get a better room soon -- he remained there several months and being unable to get a House that he Could with any satisfaction do business in -- he determined to move to Barbourville Knox Co -- which he done -- Some one of the Merchants who fancied they had lost some of their Trade by our store presented us as <hi rend="underline">Pedlers</hi> to the Grand Jury -- We thought nothing of it, nor gave it any attention Knowing it to be malicious &amp; unjust and besides Judge G. Pearl said to our M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Stone to give himself no concern about it, that<pb/>
<lb/>he would dismiss it when it came into Court -- almost Three years have now Elapsed and at the last Term of the Court at London (which was in August) William Holloway R, G, Barton -- &amp; W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> M Stone were fined Fifty dollars <hi rend="underline">each</hi> for Pedling goods &amp;c in the County of Laurel -- This is a plain statement of Facts and our object in writing is to ask respectfully that you interpose as Gov of the Commonwealth and remit said fines -- By so doing you will oblige</p>
<p>Respectfully
