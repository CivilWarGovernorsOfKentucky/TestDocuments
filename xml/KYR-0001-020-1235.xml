   <p>To his Excellency the H<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">on</hi></hi> Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of the State of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Silas N Stedman would respectfully represent that at the <date when="1860-11">November term of the Scott Circuit Court for the year 1860</date> an indictment (a copy of which is herewith filed marked "A") was brought in against him by the Grand Jury charging him with the offense of carrying concealed weapons, that at the <date when="1861-05">May</date> term following he confessed Judgment (said judgment is herewith filed marked "B") and the fine prescribed by the law was entered up against him. He would further state that he is a minor and at the time he was charged with the offence, was a student of Geotown College and was a member of the Tau Theta Kappa Literary Society which holds its meetings at night; that living some distance from the College and out of town and having to attend the meetings of said Society, he deemed it prudent, being frequently beset by vicious dogs on his road at night, to carry a weapon about his person in order that he might defend himself from such attacks and from any other that might be made upon him. He solemnly affirms that he carried said weapon for no offensive purpose whatever but solely and entirely for his<pb/>
<lb/>self defence and personal safety. He further states that it is the first time he has appeared before you as a Petitioner and he now prays your clemency and respectfully asks you to remit his fine</p>
<p>Silas N. Stedman</p>
<p>State of Kentucky
<lb/>Scott County</p>
<p>Silas N Stedman says that the statements of the foregoing petition are true</p>

<p>We the subscribers citizens of Scott County verry well acquainted with Silas Stedman state that he is a young gentleman of good character and unquestionable veracity. We believe the statements of his petition and earnestly unite in the request for a remission of his fine believing such course just and right</p>
