   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E Bramlette Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner N A Thompson states that he is a Merchant of the Town of Lancaster and had the U S License, to sell Liquors by the quart and not knowing that he was also required to get a state License for such permission, and being advised by a friend, in whose knowledge he placed implicit confidence, that his U S License was all sufficient, he did sell a single quart of Brandy; for which he was indicted and has been fined Sixty Dollars. He states that he is a law abiding man, and with no motive to do wrong, he has been innocently involved in the fine aforesaid. He hopes with the above explanation, your Excellency will feel that he ought to be relieved of the fine imposed above.</p>
