<lb/>Gov. Bramlett
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>This will be handed to you by my friend I. W. Cade clerk of the Livingston Circuit Court. He visits you as he informs me on business, relative to Capt. Bush now at Smithland</p>
<p>The facts connected with the Captains case have never come within my knowledge but you may rely implicitly upon any statement made to you by Mr Cade as I know him and have known him for many years to be a highly inteligent gentleman of the strictest integrity and his statements entitled to all confidence</p>
<p>I take great pleasure in addition to state I am intimately acquainted with Captain Bush; He studied law in my office and under my instruction for near two years; during all that time, his conduct was of the most exemplary character and at all times evinced a kind nature and a strict regard for the peace and good order of society.</p>
<p>I hope his case may be regarded by you as within the reach of Executive powers and that it may be extended to him</p>
<p>Most respectfully
<lb/>W. P. Fowler</p>
  </body>
