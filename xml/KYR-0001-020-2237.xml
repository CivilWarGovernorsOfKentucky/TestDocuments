  <body>
   <p>To the Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Calloway County respectfully Say to your Excellency that Some time ago John Braswell was indicted in the Calloway Criminal Court for an assault and battery committed by him on the person of Henry Weson, and was recognized with G S and James Coleman and P S. Hamlin his Securities to appear and answer said charge, That he (Braswell) left the country, failed to appear, and the recognizance was taken as forfeited, and at the <date when="--03">present (March) term</date> Judgement has been rendered against his securities for $300 the amount of said recognizance</p>
<p>Now we are informed that a petition has been or will be sent to your Excellency asking a remission of said Judgement against this we do protest and earnestly remonstrate -- 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> Because the said case of the Commonwealth against said Braswell has been tried at the present term of the Court and a verdict and Judgement rendered that he (Braswell) should pay a fine of $300 and be imprisoned five months this shows that in the opinion of the Jury the case was a verry ag=<pb/>
<lb/>gravated one, which is the fact</p>
<p>2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> Because the proof showed that two boys (said Henry Weson being one of them) were engaged in a fight which had been brought about <hi rend="str">by</hi> and urged on by said Braswell and that whilst they were so engaged Braswell ran up and without a word, struck Wesson with a large <hi rend="underline">loaded</hi> hickory stick on the head cutting a gash from two to three inches long and about the fourth of an inch across, that said Wesson would from the effects of said Wesson would from the effect of said wound have fallen had he not been caught, that said wound was dangerous that said stick was a very dangerous weapon, that Braswell continued to beat Weson with the same until he was taken off by person present. That there was no reasonable excuse for this outrage that it was made clear by the evidence that had he been indicted for malicious striking he must have been convicted.</p>
<p>/3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> His said securities ought not to be released from any part of said Judgement because they were informed of the extent of the outrage and went his bail with their eyes open, <hi rend="str">they have</hi><pb/>
<lb/><hi rend="str">now been <unclear/><unclear/><unclear/> informed <unclear/><unclear/><unclear/></hi> And 4<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> A powerful reason against executive clemency in cases like this is that it <hi rend="str">exerts</hi> ^has^ a most destructive influence on society and indirectly if not directly encourages the commission of crime and breach of the penal laws -- 5<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> When men become Security for ^the appearance of^ other charged with commission of crime th<hi rend="str">at</hi>ey should be made to know that they must pay the penalty if the bond be forfeited otherwise the people cannot and will not respect the law but must and will loose all confidense in it as a shield to protect them against crime and outrage -- </p>
<p>Alexander Wesson</p>
