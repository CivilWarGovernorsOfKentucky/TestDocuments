<lb/>To His Excellency,
<lb/>Thos E Bramlette,
<lb/>Governor of Ky:</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Christian County, would most Respectfully represent to your Excellency the case of Jason Ladd, one of our citizens for the exercise of executive clemency, -- as will appear from a copy of the Indictment and Judgment of <hi rend="str">said</hi> court herewith enclosed, It will be seen that there was rendered at the <date when="1863-09">September term of our Circuit Court 1863</date> a Judgment of Fifty Dollars (for selling a stray-mule,) against the said Ladd -- </p>
<p>Said Ladd is a very old man, in extremely indigent circumstances, and a very large family dependent upon his daily labor for support, and although bowed down with years, was among the first to respond to the call of his country, for Soldiers to combat treason, and as we are informed demeaned himself in that capacity bravely, and as a patriot -- We would therefore most respectfully ask that, if not incompatible with the public good Said fine may be Remitted by your Excellency</p>
<p>Most Respectfully
