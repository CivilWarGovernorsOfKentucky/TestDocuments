   <p>To His Excellency Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners Jurors and other citizens of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, who were present in Court on the trial of George W. Cushman in Covington under a charge of stealing a Horse and buggy from George M. M. Linn of Covington, state that the Conviction was had upon a plea of "guilty" on the part of the prisoner. They state that the circumstances of the case as devoloped on the trial and by the entire conduct of the prisoner, were and are such as in their opinion render the case one peculiarly calling for executive clemency. That cushmans previous life is represented as having been unexceptionally honest, and that this appears to have been his only offence.</p>

<p>If the information which I have received, and on which I implicitly rely, is correct, Cushman ought in my opinion to be pardoned immediately</p>
