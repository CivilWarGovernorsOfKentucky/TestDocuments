<lb/>His Excellency Gov Magoffin,
<lb/>Dear Sir -- </p>
<p>I have been requested by M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Henry J Righter of Harrison County, to address you a petition praying for a remission of a fine of $50.<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> inflicted upon him at the <date when="--11">last Nov Term</date> of the Harrison Circuit Court upon an Indictment for carrying concealed Weapons, -- I was the Attorney for M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Righter in the case, and will make a brief statement of, the facts proved <hi rend="str">in</hi> on the trial. It was proved that some time in <date when="--09">September</date> -- Righter and a man named Smith had <hi rend="str">on</hi> ^a sudden^ altercation and an affray at Colemansville -- in which Righter used a pistol -- they were tried and fined Righter $25 and Smith $20 -- It was proved that Righter was a peaceable young man not in the habit of carrying weapons -- and<hi rend="underline"> happened</hi> to have a weapon on that occasion, from the fact that he had just returned from Virginia where he had been on a trip, to sell Horses. He had carried a weapon on that trip for the purpose of protecting and defending his life and property -- and that his home was not at Colemansville -- but near Cynthiana. He had not been to his home, since<pb/>
<lb/>his return from Virginia, but had just stopped for a day or two, to visit his uncle near Colemansville -- The Circuit Judge thought, and correctly, that these facts could not <hi rend="underline">under the law</hi>, be given in justification -- but they were before the Jury, and though they were compelled to fine, they placed it at the lowest amount they were authorized to under the law,</p>
<p>I hope your Excellency, will extend clemency to this young man, satisfied as I am, that he never designed to violate the law, and that <hi rend="str">as</hi> he is a young man of slender means, and of good character for peace and order</p>
<p>Yrs very Respectfully
