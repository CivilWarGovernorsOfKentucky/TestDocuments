   <p>To His Excellency, Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners would respectfully represent That at the pending term of the Harrison Circuit Court, Cha<hi rend="sup">s</hi> A. Webster was tried by a jury of said county on the charge of carrying concealed weapons and upon the verdict of said jury a fine was assessed against him to the amount of fifty Dollars ($50.<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi>)</p>
<p>We the undersigned would represent to Your Excellency that all the weapons which said Webster has carried were procured by him since the excitement which grew out of the Jn<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Brown raid upon Harpers Ferry and furthermore they were procured to defend the persons and property of the Citizens of Kentucky against any aggressions that Northern fanatics might make upon them</p>
<p>We would further say that the fine was inflicted upon him in strict accordance with the letter of the law from which the Court did not feel itself at liberty to depart notwithstanding the dangers that threatened the Country. But in as much as Mr. Webster did no more than was necessary under the Circumstances, and no more than was done by many other of the most respectable citizens of the county at the time, we respectfully ask that his fine be remitted
