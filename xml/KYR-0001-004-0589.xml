   <p>To
<lb/>Hon. Thos. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>On the <gap/> day of <date when="1864-02">February 1864</date> James W. Gilpin and Preston Sullivan were so unfortunate as to have a difficulty which results in a "breach of the Peace" by said Gilpin, who was duely tried and fined, twenty dollars, by the Police Judge of the city of Frankfort, on the <gap/> day of <date when="1864-02">February 1864</date></p>
<p>Gilpin is a citizen of Frankfort, a poor man, dependent upon his daily labor for his support. He has served in the Army of his country till he, unfortunately, received a wound which has disabled, him and therefore deprived him of the use of his full physical powers. Gilpin is unable to pay the fine assessed against him, and we, your petitioners, believing that the amt. of the costs in the case will be a degree of punishment adequate to the offence and the circumstances connected therewith, do hereby pray you to extend to him that clemency, which the law, in its mercy, has empowered you to exercise-</p>
