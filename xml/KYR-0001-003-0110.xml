   <p>HEAD-QUARTERS ACT'G ASST. PROVOST MARSHAL GENERAL, and ^Chief Mustering &amp; Disbursing officer^
<lb/>STATE OF KENTUCKY,
<lb/>Louisville, Ky., <date when="1865-08-17">17 August 1865</date>
<lb/>His Excellency Thos. E. Bramlette Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Frankfort Ky.
<lb/>Governor</p>
<p>Under the direction of the War Department instructing that the colors of Volunteer organizations mustered out and discharged from the service of the United States under recent orders be delivered by the Chief Mustering officers to the Governors of their respective states, I have the honor to forward herewith, by the hands of Captain S. A. Wainwright, 13" U. S. Infy, mustering officer, the colors of the volunteer organizations of Kentucky designated herein which up to this date have been finally discharged under my supervision: viz. 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> &amp; 34<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Regiments of Infantry, 2<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> Regiment of Cavalry and 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Independent Battery -- all of which you will please receive.</p>
<p>I will from time to time hereafter forward the colors of other organizations as fast as they are in like manner discharged.</p>
<p>I deem it a privelege to be the officer designated by the government of the United States to transfer from its ser-<pb/>
<lb/>vice and deliver back to the State into the hands of its Governor the colers which have flown in so many battle-fields and under whose shadow such numbers of Kentuckys brave soldiers have shed their blood -- even their life-blood -- or have followed through toil &amp; suffering to the final triumph. Under these torn &amp; soiled colers Kentucky's faithful sons, while achieving for themselves a glorious renown, have won honor for the state and rendered enduring service to their country in contributing their full share to its perpetual preservation as an undivided Union, through which, within at most a short half century of peace, it is destined to become the first power of the earth in strength as it is sure the first in beneficence.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be
<lb/>Governor
