<lb/>Gov Bramlette</p>
<p>My friend Geo Anderson of this County has this morning called ^on^me for a letter of introduction to you, he informs me that his Son joined a recruiting Officer who claimed to belong to Jessee -- while on a Spree and was the next day Captured by Bridwater on the highway without weapons. Mr Anderson is a gentleman and will represent the facts to you correctly. Mr A advocated your election for Govener to my personal knowledge and has all the time that I have known him advocated perfect obedience to all Federal and State laws and &amp; Military orders, I am intimately acquainted with Mr Anderson and know that he went further than I could endorse in the advocacy of the present Administration, Any favour consistent with duty grnated to Mr Anderson will not be dishonored by him, I feel for him as good citizen, His house was my place of refuge the night I escaped from the Guerrillas after my brutal treatment by them He has from the commencement been my <hi rend="underline">friend</hi>.</p>
<p>Truly
