<lb/>To His Excellency Govn<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Robinson</p>
<p>The undersigned Citizens of Henry County Ky would resepectfully state that as the last <date when="--09">septr</date> term of the Henry Ct Court a Judgment for $150 &amp; costs was rendered vs Edward Hayden in favor of the Commonwealth for striking &amp; beating M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Ransdale. That the difficulty grew out of a conversation about slavery &amp;c. The Evidence having been transmitted to you by the Judge of this Court -- </p>
<p>We have known Edward Hayden for many years and we believe and are fully satisfied that for ten or fifteen years he has been and is now a monomaniac on the subject of Religion and Especially on the subject of slavery. He thinks it a sin to own or sell a slave. He believes that he has shared revelations from god. He is rational on other subjects. But on these if difered with he becomes furious and will at any time fall out with his best friends &amp; even with his own brothers. He would not attend the trial or sanction this petition because he said God would attend to it for him -- We believe that no fine however great would have any influence or restraint on his conduct. He has no difficulties or quarrels with any one<pb/>
<lb/>unless the subject of slavery is mentioned &amp; his views disagreed to. We believe he is not responsible for his conduct growing out of the slavery question and therefore we believe this fine ought as a matter of pure justice to be remitted and therefore ask your Excellency to remit the same.</p>
