   <p>To His Excellency Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Govenor of Ky -- </p>
<p>Your Excellency is advised that Mr Joseph Roberts was fined $50. for having in his possession a <hi rend="underline">deadly</hi> <hi rend="underline">weapons</hi> The proof of <hi rend="underline">Concealment</hi> was only circumstanccial. Mr. Roberts had never carried a weapon before -- In this instance, when about to be suddenly involved in a personal Encounter a Friend handed to him a pistol -- This friend would not attend the trial -- He was afraid of being indicted himself -- If he had excused Roberts, he would have been indicted in all probability, so he failed to attend the trial -- Mr. Roberts is a very estimable gentleman and should be pardoned &amp;c He prays a remissions of his fine &amp;c -- </p>

<p>The Petitioner is a very worthy young Gentleman whom I have known from his Infancy &amp; I am satisfied he has never been in the <hi rend="underline">habit</hi> of carrying concealed weapons &amp; should be pleased to see the fine remitted</p>

<p>I know Joseph Roberts, this petitioner and know him to be a young man of good moral character and has never been charged with the commission of any offense. The carrying of the weapon as charged in the Indictment under which he was convicted occured christmas night when young men were generally released from their labors. I think from this character of company he keeps and the society in which he moves in connection with his own heretofore good conduct that his case is worthy of executive clemency. I hope your Excellency will remit this fine</p>
