   <p>To his Excellency
<lb/>The Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the <date when="1862-08">August Term ^1862^</date> of the Circuit Court of Campbell County Conrad Vieman was fined $50.00 and costs for selling liquor to a minor.<figure type="hr"/></p>
<p>But we have no doubt that it was either a malicious prosecution or instituted merely for <hi rend="str">(the sake of a small sum to be paid by an officer or officers -- who were using the prosecuting witness to entrap the innocent)</hi> <hi rend="str">for them</hi> his own mercenary gain -- and without regard to the public good moreover, most every stranger would consider him of age -- <figure type="hr"/></p>
<p>We have known Mr. Veiman for several years past as a law abiding citizen -- and indeed the enforcement of this fine would be a very serious matter with him -- as he is on the verge of the grave with a Scrofulous disease -- and his family is almost destitute of the necessaries of life -- <figure type="hr"/></p>
<p>We therefore hope that you will conclude that it is just and proper to <hi rend="underline">remit</hi> this fine -- </p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Newport <date when="1862-01-05">January 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1862</date> <date when="1862-01-05">[1863]</date><pb/></p>
