   <p>To his Excellency Gov Magoffin</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Winchester Clark County Kentucky respectfully represent the following state of fact, relative to a Fine imposed upon James W, Webster Jr in the "Police Court of Winchester Ky" It appear<hi rend="str">ed</hi>s <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>from the statements of the byestanders, that young Webster was first insulted by being Called a Liar -- which charge was gratuitous &amp; unfounded &amp; provoked him to throw back the <hi rend="underline">charge</hi> in the teeth of his adversary who was a grown man, and who drew a ^heavy^ stick and struck twice at said Webster, who in defense drew a pocket Knife, and the parties were separated. The said Webster in the absence of his Father from town, was wrongly advised to confess Judgment, If he had been tried we have no doubt he would have been acquitted. The said Webster is a small crippled youth -- being a crippled from his birth -- He is <hi rend="str">a</hi> peacable <hi rend="str">young</hi> <hi rend="str">man</hi> and poor and industrious His Father is a poor ^man^ but a worthy citizen<pb/>
<lb/>We resepectfully ask of your Excellency to remit said <hi rend="underline">Fine</hi> which is $10<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> exclusive of the Costs -- the costs being $4 <hi rend="sup">50</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi> without the 10<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi></p>
