  <body>
   <p>To His Excellency C S. Morehead, Governor of the Com'th of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners respectfully represent to Your Ex'cy that Chas H Tomlin was at the <date when="--11">Nov. Term</date> of the Scott circuit court tried on an indictment for Manslaughter and found guilty and sentanced by the court to confinement and hard labor in the Peneientiary for six years -- And that your petitioners are many of them acquainted personally and others by reputation with the said Tomlin and they represent unto Your Ex'cy that he is a poor, uneducated, and feeble man, with a wife and two ^young^ children who were dependant wholely upon him for their support and who are now penniless, and maintained by his relative who are their selves quite poor -- and illy able to provide for their own families, They say that the man killed by Tomlin is Thos. Estes was the brother in law of Tomlin and a violent hasty man and that the quarrell no occured in the night time, and at a retired house at Estes own house, in the midst of his own family &amp; friends, that it was impossible for Tomlin to prove his innocence -- and entirely exculpate himself -- Though from the fact that Estes was a violent and hasty man and was more over drunk at the time that Thomlin gave him the<pb/>
<lb/>shot from the effects of which he died, and from Tomlins own statement, which We beleived -- We are of the opinion that Thos H. Tomlin was but little to blame -- We further represent that said Tomlin is a consumptive and is now in ill health from a disease of the lungs -- and can not long survive in the situation in which he now is -- that he has been compelled to be continually under the treatment of the physician ever since he has been confined in the penetintiary -- Wherefore in as much as his days are certain to be but few: and in as much as his crime was far from a foul one -- was convicted in the heat of passion by a man who was at the time a consumptive and dyspeptive and he has paid already heavily for his transgression We pray your Ex'cy to pardon him to restore him to his family, and kindred, while yet he lives! as his further confinement in the penetentiary could possibly work no good to the state or to society -- and even his release could but be only a gratifications to the feelings of his wife and little ones -- for his days for labor have passed -- Respectfully your obedient servants -- Tomlin lived in Franklin</p>
