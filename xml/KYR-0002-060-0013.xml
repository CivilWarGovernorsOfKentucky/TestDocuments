<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>Your note of the <date when="1865-06-03">3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Inst</date> is at hand -- The Sheff has the warrant for Warren? Arrest &amp; he Just tells me that he can not get men to go when summoned to form the Posse Commitatus They will not go -- I learned on what I thought was reliable authority that warren had gone out of the County &amp; was in Flemingsburg with his father a few days since but the sheff thinks that he is still in the county<pb/>
<lb/> -- The U. S. M. Authorities sent one Downs here or at least to M<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Sterling &amp; delivered him to our Sheff on Bench Warrant &amp; he is now in Jail -- Bail $250 -- Some of his friends talk about giving it -- If they do not the Jail will be broken &amp; he taken out</p>
<p>The sheff wants Barbers men to arrest another man out here some 6 miles for whom he has a Bench Warrant Barbers men have not come to the time of writing this</p>
<p>I tell you what I will do I will write Judge Apperson &amp; have him hold a special Term &amp; try <hi rend="underline">em</hi> all That is the<pb/>
<lb/>best -- </p>
<p>my opinion is that the authorities will take warren and all the ballance if sustained</p>
