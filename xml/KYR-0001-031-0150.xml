<lb/>Jas W. Tate Esq
<lb/>Asst Secy of State
<lb/>Dr Sir.</p>
<p>On transacting some business for your State this day my attention was called by my clerk to the fact that a letter was received at my office last fall from you, stating -- that you had never received my oath of office as Com<hi rend="sup">r</hi> for Kentky nor your fee $5<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi>.</p>
<p>On examination I find that your letter arrived during my absence from the City and through mistake was filed away without coming to my notice.</p>
<p>On a further examination I find that your statements therein are correct. and am much at loss to conceive how such a jumble of errors could have passed by so long since without being noticed.</p>
<p>I must ask to be excused for what<pb/>
<lb/>appears to be such gross carelessness. trusting that an occurrence of like nature will not again occur.</p>
<p>Enclosed you will please find the oath and your fee $5.00 the receipt of which please acknowledge.</p>
<p>Very Respty
<lb/>Your most Obt Servt
