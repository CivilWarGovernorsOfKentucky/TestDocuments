   <p>I can certify to the truth of the statements contained in the foregoing affidavit. It was proved that a glass of liquor had been sold -- and no proof other than this <hi rend="underline">one</hi> <hi rend="underline">selling</hi> was adduced -- at affiants house, "the Clinton Hotel", to one Thomas Dickey, during the Christmas holidays of <date when="1863">1863.</date> It was also proved that Dickey was one and twenty years of age on <date when="1864-02-06">February 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1864;</date> on about <hi rend="underline">5 weeks</hi> after he was alleged to have done the drinking. Also that Dickey had been for some time doing business -- buying and selling -- and making contracts in his own name It neither appeared that he had a parent or authorized guardian. He was to all appearances a man aged at least 21 years; had a beard, and the size, mien and bearing of a man fully grown. I am satisfied affiant was deceived by the circumstances above indicated; and violated a penal law without intending so to do. The character of affiant as a man and hotel-keeper is good. The case, it seems to me, merits Executive clemency</p>
