<p>Elias Martin says he is and has been acquainted with Thomas B. Wadlington and with his general character for many years, that he lives a neighbor to said Wadlington, that he is an honest uprwright and law abiding citizen, and so regarded by his acquaintances. He further states, that he is acquainted with the character of the witness John Prince, and from his characer, and from his personal knowledge of said Prince he does not believe him to be entitled to credit as a sworn witness in a court of Justice, and he does believe, that the evidence he gave in ^the^ case as to the manner of the Killing and as to who committed the first attack is untrue. and he does believe, that said Wadlington has been unjustly convicted on false testimony. He says he knows said Prince well, he said Prince lived with him for a whole year</p>
