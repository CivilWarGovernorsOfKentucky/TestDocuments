   <p>Gov. Magoffin</p>
<p>You can rely implicitly upon the Statements made to you by Mr. Shields and Mr. Downs, I have known them from my youth up. I was born in a few miles of Vincent Shields in the County of Spencer, we were school boys together The <hi rend="str">f</hi>Family are entirely respectable and worthy</p>
<p>I feel a deep Sympathy for my old friend and earnestly recommend him to the Executive clemency. I have heard much of his case at the time of the occurence and since, and feel sure that it will justify your interference</p>
<p>Your &amp;c
