<lb/>Capt Finny
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I have this day forwarded to Gov Bramlett the petition of young Nall &amp; Jones Charged with the murder of Sam Dial and at the earnest request of the fathers of these two young men I address you to solicit your influence on their behalf. The Pitetion is signed by about 350 or 400 person's most of them you will discover being the very best citizens of this County irrespective of politics.</p>
<p>I wish you would call on the Gov immediately and give such information as you can, for I do think that if there ever was a case which demanded the intervention of Executive Clemency this is one</p>
<p>Please let me hear from you upon the subject</p>
<p>Yours Truely</p>
<p>C W Cook</p>
<p>P S Get Mr Gregory to assist you</p>
