   <p>To His Excellency, Thomas E. Bramlette, Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>
<p>The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Louisville, respectfully represent that at the <date when="1863-01">January term 1863</date> of the Jefferson Circuit Court, Josiah Easton was convicted on an indictment for Grand Larceny. The deft. had previously sustained an excellent character for honesty. He has a wife and four children now destitute, having no support other than that supplied by the labor of the said Eaton. He had been nearly a year in prison awaiting his trial on the above charge and has been over a year in prison since his conviction. We believe that the punishment he has already suffered, and a reference to his former good character, with the fact of the helpless condition of his innocent family, are matters that will be taken into consideration and justify an exercise of the Executive clemency in his behalf.</p>
<p>And your Petitioners will ever pray &amp;c.</p>
