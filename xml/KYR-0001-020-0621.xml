<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>B. Magoffin
<lb/>Frankfort
<lb/>Ky -- My Dear Governor.</p>
<p>I herewith enclose you, a copy of a recognizance entered into by me, as Surety for John white, for his appearance at the <date when="1861-01">January Term 1861</date> of the M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cracken Equity and Criminal court, to answer any Indictment that may be found against him. </p>
<p>Mr White was arrested under our city ordinance for drunkenness, and was lodged in jail and when the whiskey died out of him, he found himself in prison, and attempted to breakout of Jail, there being other prisoners in jail for Felony -- He was tried for drunkenness and fined and he was immediately arrested for an attempt to break jail, and was held to bail at our court aforesaid in the sum of $100.00 -- I was not his attorney, nor had I anything to do with his case -- And upon his requesting me to go his bail, I did so, knowing him to be a peaceable and quit &amp; honorable man<pb/>
<lb/>when Sober; a few days before our criminal Court commenced its <date when="1861-01">January term 1861</date>, Mr white, received intelligence that his mother was dangerously ill, at Louisville, and he called on me to get my consent, for him to visit his mother, I did so willingly, and he was not at Court, when the case was called, and I Stated the circumstances to Court, and the Court declared the recognizance forfeited, but Said, it should be set aside, if white made his appearance during the term -- I send you a copy of said order -- The week after court adjourned, Mr white appeared, and Surrendered himself to me, and he is now here, lives here, and is doing his business as a mechanic faithfully -- The reason he did not appear at court, was on account of the continued ill health of his mother &amp; finally her death -- </p>
<p>The Grand Jury did not find a true bill against Mr White -- ignored the whole Subject -- &amp; I hope your Ecellency will interpose, and <hi rend="underline">remit</hi> the forfeiture of said bond; and Save me any future trouble or expense about it -- It was merely and act of kindness on my part, without fee or hope of reward</p>
<p>Yours Very truly</p>
<p>John Q. A. King<pb/></p>
