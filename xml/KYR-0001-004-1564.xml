   <p>To His Excellency Tho. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi>. of Kentucky; -- </p>
<p>The petition of <hi rend="underline">Milton Hamilton</hi> (<hi rend="underline">Executor</hi> of <hi rend="underline">Wickliffe Grubbs</hi>) and of <hi rend="underline">William Grubbs</hi>, respectfully sheweth; -- </p>
<p>That in the year <date when="1858">1858</date> <hi rend="underline">Eveline</hi> -- a female slave -- the property of <hi rend="underline">Mrs. Patience Grubbs</hi> of <hi rend="underline">Boone county</hi> -- was held, by an examining court, to appear at the <date when="1858-09">September (1858)</date> term of the Boone Circuit Court, to answer a charge of <hi rend="underline">Infanticide</hi>.</p>
<p>The negro woman being in bad and failing health; and also out of consideration <hi rend="str">of</hi> for her owner Mrs. Grubbs, who was a widow, and a relative of theirs; <hi rend="underline">Wickliffe Grubbs</hi> and <hi rend="underline">William Grubbs</hi>, to keep said negro woman from being incarcerated for about 6 months in the county Jail, became securities for her appearance at the <date when="1859-04">April term for 1859</date> of said Circuit Court.</p>
<p>The woman, however, being frightened at the idea of appearance and trial in court, ran away from her mistress ^without her knowledge or that of either of said Grubbs'^ a few days before the <date when="1859-04">April term for 1859,</date> and has not since been heard from. Efforts were made to find her but without avail.<pb/></p>
<p>The bond for $100 Executed by Wickliffe and William Grubbs as securities of said negro woman Eveline was forfeited in <date when="1859-04">April 1859.</date></p>
<p>Your petitions have been informed and verily believe that, though there were suspicions and unusual circumstances attending the case of this woman, she was not guilty of the charge preferred against her, and would certainly have been acquitted had she not run away, but appeared and stood her trial.</p>
<p>Mrs. Patience Grubbs died some years since, leaving little or no property.</p>
<p>Wickliffe Grubbs also departed this life some three years ago leaving M. Hamilton of Burlington Boone Co. his Executor.</p>
<p>Your petitioners have never been prosecuted, or called on to pay the above $100 bond; but they dislike to leave the same standing against them; and under the circumstances. pray that your Excellency will grant them a remission of the same.</p>
<p>M. Hamilton (Ex<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> of W. Grubbs.)
<lb/>W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Grubbs</p>
<p>Burlington Ky.
<lb/><date when="1865-03-01">March 1, 1865=</date><pb/></p>
<p>Commonwealth of Kentucky
<lb/>Kenton County } SS</p>
<p>Personally appeared before me a Justice of the Peace in and for the county aforesaid Robt. Richardson; and made oath as follows. -- </p>
<p>At the <date when="1859-04"><hi rend="underline">April term for 1859</hi></date> of the <hi rend="underline">Boone Circuit Court</hi> a judgment on a <hi rend="underline">forfeited recognizance</hi> was rendered in the amount of <hi rend="underline">$100</hi> against <hi rend="underline">Wickliffe Grubbs</hi> and <hi rend="underline">W</hi><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi><hi rend="underline"> Grubbs</hi>; securities for one <hi rend="underline">Eveline</hi>, a <hi rend="underline">female slave</hi>, the property of Mrs Patience Grubbs, charged with infanticide.</p>
<p>I had been retained as counsel for this negro; and managed the case.</p>
<p>At the previous <date when="1858-09">September</date> term she had been brought into court; and it then being impossible to dispose of her case, Judge Elijah Nuttall suggested that as a matter of humanity (the woman being in a delicate condition) she ought not to be kept 6 months or so in jail. Wickliffe and W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Grubbs, relatives of the womans mistress, then stepped forward and became securities for her appearance at the next term.</p>
<p>A short time before the next term the woman ran away; and judgt was rendered as aforesaid against the Mess<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> Grubbs in the sum of $100. I remember I was<pb/>
<lb/>both displeased and disappointed at this elopement of the negroe's. I thought then and think still no case could have been made out against her; but presume she ran away influenced by fright. There were suspicious circumstances attending the delivery of her infant (an illegitimate one) which was found dead; but after an attentive examination of all the proofs I told the parties they need have no fears of the negroe's conviction. To the best of my remembrance the Grand Jury ignored the bill against this woman. But of this I cannot be positive; as it has been a long while ago. I remember disticntly, however, P. U. Major Esq., then Commonwealth's attorney, told me he did not think the charge could be sustained, and the woman would have to be acquitted if tried; but she had then taken fright and ran away; and I believe has not since been heard from.</p>
