<p>The sandy Island above Louisville is owned &amp; claimed by Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Joyes, Francis L Smith &amp; Robt Tyler's heirs, who held possession through Thomas Joyes &amp; his tenants. The Island is claimed by Andrew Pope's heirs &amp; Geigers' heirs who gave some person permission to occupy the Island &amp; to sell the willows &amp;c, though the property was in the possession of the first named parties.</p>
<p>That person sold some Eighty or one hundred dollars worth of the willows to these Germans who have been fined for an assault committed on Dunn who was moving away the willows under the instruction of Pat Joyes atty -- </p>
<p>A suit has been instituted against Pope's &amp; Geiger's heirs and these Germans in Chancery to quit titles &amp;c &amp; Dunn the tenant has already recovered a Judgment of $50<hi rend="sup">00</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi> agate costs against these Germans for trespass to his possession ^in a separate suit^ -- They therefore have to pay quite a bill of costs in the matter &amp; are ignorant men &amp; have been punishd -- </p>
<p>We hope therefore that the fine will be remitted as they have been already punished enough for example &amp; we believe knowing the facts that it is a fair subject for executive clemency &amp; therefore respectfully ask a remission of the fine -- </p>
