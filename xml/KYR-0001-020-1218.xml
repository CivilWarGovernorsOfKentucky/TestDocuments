   <p>To His Excellency B. Magoffin the Govenor of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>Your Excellency is hereby informed that the Undersigned Robert F. Baird &amp; J. H. Price Citizens of Louisville and attorneys at Law, became the <hi rend="underline">sureties</hi> of one Joseph Millett who was charged with "setting up a Lottery" in this city contrary to law -- And who was required to give Bail to answer in the sum of <hi rend="underline">One</hi> <hi rend="underline">Hundred</hi> <hi rend="underline">Dollars</hi> -- </p>
<p>They further state that Said Willett defaulted and failed to appear and the onus of the Bond falls upon the undersigned.</p>
<p>They further state that the charge was of so insignificant consequences that it ^was^ dismissed upon the calling of the Indictment against Willett -- </p>
<p>Your Petitioners think as the indictment agst. Willett was dismissed that they ought to be relieved of their Bond as bail in said case -- </p>
<p>They therefore earnestly pray your Excellency to remit the Forfeiture in the case of the commth vs Joseph Willett, so far as R. F. Baird &amp; J. H. Price <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>is concerned -- </p>
<p>Robert F. Baird
<lb/>J. H. Price</p>
<p>We the undersigned ask your Excellency to remit the Forfeiture alluded to -- </p>
