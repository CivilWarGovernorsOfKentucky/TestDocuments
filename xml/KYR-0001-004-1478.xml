   <p>To His Excellency Gov. Bramlett</p>
<p>Your petitioner E. K. Owsly would represent to your Excellency, That at the <date when="1864-09">Sept term 1864.</date> ^of the Barren cir't Court^ through the malicious feeling of some persons, he was indicted for hog stealing, this is not only a serious, but an odious charge. He has a young and he hopes a promising family whose reputation as well as his own <hi rend="str">is</hi> ^are^ solely dependant upon the conduct of your petitioner, and although he is as innocent of the foul charge as the unborn infant, yet the same malice which prompted the finding of said indictment, would be used perhaps in a four fold manner to sustain the nefarious charge, he is thus from being at the mercy of a set of unprincipled enimies compelled to ask your Excellency to use that clemency which is invested in you by the Constitution, of pardoning, not a real offence, but one haveing its origin in the most complete vilainly which ever stained the records of a Court of Justice, did he have any equal chance with these men, he would court an <hi rend="str">inquisition</hi> investigation, knowing his innocenc<hi rend="str">y</hi>e but he has not, and therefore asks your Excellency to stop this outrageous proceedings</p>
