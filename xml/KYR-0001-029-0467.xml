<lb/>My Dear Sir</p>
<p>You will see that we have been indicted as <hi rend="underline">Pedlers</hi> by the good people of Laurel County -- I Enclose my affidavit with the petition of a few of our most prominent Citizens to his Excellency the Gov praying him to <hi rend="underline">squash</hi> proceedings -- It is a good Joke on us -- but the worst of it is, that the indictment is a <hi rend="underline">fact</hi> -- and I do not want to go to London these war times to defend it -- It was done by <hi rend="underline">one</hi> Mark Hardin a Jack leg Lawyer &amp; Merchant of that Town, who doubtless felt we interfered with him in his trade -- purely a piece of Malice on his part -- The Court comes on there in a few days and I would like to have the Govenors <hi rend="underline">pardon</hi> if he will grant it -- as soon as possible -- will you do me the kindness to present it and ask speedy action and oblige Your Friend</p>
