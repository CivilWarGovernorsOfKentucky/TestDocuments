   <p>Maysville, April 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> / 62
<lb/>Gov Magoffin</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I wrote you some days ago respecting a judgment rendered by the Mason Circuit Court, against William McClannahan, as bail for the appearance of my husband Robert Th Sheppard, in the Mason Circuit Court, to answer the charge of passing two counterfeit half dollars. </p>
<p>I have received no reply &amp; I fear you have not received my letter. I tried in that let-ter to give you a truthful statement of the facts of the case, hoping and believing them sufficient to authorize you to release Mr <pb/>
<lb/>McClannahan from the payment of the money. He is in great distress, &amp; is anxious to hear from you. Will you please answer, and say whether there is any hope that you will release him. </p>
<p>I am in great distress, and beg your pardon for writing a second letter so soon. Hoping you will write me,</p>
<p>I am respectfully 
<lb/>Mary Sheppard
<lb/>Wife of R Th Sheppard.<pb/></p>
<p>Remitted- see
<lb/>M Clanahan's 
<lb/>Petition- 
<lb/>B.M</p>
