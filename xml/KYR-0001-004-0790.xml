   <p>Lancaster <date when="1864-04-12">12<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> April 64</date>
<lb/>To his Excellency Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> E. Bramlett Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>
<p>The undersigned would state to your Excellency that they were the counsel who defended Tarlton Broadus in the Garrard Circuit Court at the last term thereof under the charge of Horse stealing and from the evidence in the case we were clearly satisfied that he only intended to press and not to steal the horse; the evidence showed that he belonged to the 1<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">st</hi></hi> Ky Cavalry and had a furlough to visit his widowed mother in Washington County to do which he had to pass through Garrard and upon arriving near the residence of George Robinson (the prosecutor) he (deft) offered a negro a dollar to procure him a horse as his had broken down; the horse being brought to him he went on to his mother's -- residence and reached there on -- Sunday evening the horse having been procured on the day before; that on<pb/>
<lb/>Monday evening following the prosecuor with his Assistant (most of whom were secessionists) arrived at the residence of the Mother of Deft and finding him confined in the bed sick took him out and brought him to Lancaster and had him confined in Jail for twelve (12) months before the trial; there was at least one half of the Jury who were secessionists and all of <hi rend="underline">them</hi> refused to sign a petition for his pardon- while the union portion of the jury unhesitatingly signed it.</p>
<p>We do not believe that deft had a fair trial- he is considered by his acquaintances an honest man and a good soldier- and we believe that at least nine (9) out of every ten (10) men with whom he is acquainted and know the circumstances of the case would rejoice in the event he should be pardoned.</p>
<p>Wherefore we Respectfully ask your Excellency to immediately release Tarlton Broaddus and restore him to his widowed mother and to his duties in the field of Action where he can again as he so often has done bear his arm in the defence of his country's cause.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully &amp;c
<lb/>R D Lusk
<lb/>R. M. Bradley<pb/></p>
<p>Mr Dunlap who aided us in the defense is too unwell to sign this petition, but <hi rend="str">conc</hi> concurs in all the Statements therein.</p>
