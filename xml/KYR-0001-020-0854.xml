<p>To his Excellency B. Magoffin governor. The under signed petitioners would represent to your Excellency that Francis M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Guire was fined for a breach of the penal Laws of this state by the Carter circuit the Sum of $10 Now we think that his case kneeds your clemency for these reasons. he is a poor man with a family to support and Educate and the breach of the Penal Law was a mere accident and that his <hi rend="str">are <unclear/> walking man</hi> character is good that he is a man resepcted by his neighbors and those that Know him but times are so hard that he is unable to pay said fine, therefore we petition you to remit said fine of ten Dollars, and for such relief we shall ever pray</p>
