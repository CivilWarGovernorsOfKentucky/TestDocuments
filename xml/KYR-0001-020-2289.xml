  <body>
   <p>To his Excellency Governor B Magoffin</p>
<p>Your petitioner Philip Hendricks respectfully represents, that on the <date when="1860-03-08">8th of March 1860</date> his Stepston John McCoy was apprehended on the charge of stealing bacon, tried before an examing court in Woodford County and required to give bond for his appearance in the Woodford Circuit Court on the <date when="1860-04">1st day of its April term 1860</date> in the sum $250 ^on which petitioner became surety^ (A copy of the bond is here to attached) At the April term of said court an indictment was returned against M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Coy, but he did not appear. His failure to appear was as petitioner beleives ^caused^ by threats made against him <hi rend="str">was</hi> more than by any fear of conviction Petitioner states that he is advanced life, too old to get about or to labor. That his wife is old and that he has a family to support That his estate is a very limited one, scarcely enough to support him &amp; family and to pay this bond would, especially if his property is sold under execution <hi rend="str">would</hi> so reduce him as to render it necessary for him to rely upon the charity of the world He therefore respectfully asks your<pb/>
<lb/>Excellency to interpose and relieve him from the penalty of said bond</p>
<p>Philip Henricks</p>
<p>We join in the request made of your Excellency to release Mr Hendricks from the payment of the bond mentioned in his foregoing petition</p>
