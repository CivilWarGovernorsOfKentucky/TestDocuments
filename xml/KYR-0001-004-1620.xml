   <p>To his excellency Governor Bramlette</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Newport, Campbell County Ky. Respectfully represent that at the <date when="1865-02">February Term 1865,</date> of the Campbell Circuit Court -- James M Southgate was convicted of the offense of carrying concealed about his person a dirk knife. But one occasion of carrying was proven and on that occasion he did not seem to be particular about its being seen. He never in any way attempted to use the weapon and on the occasion referred to, was on his way home from Newport by a road on which it was proved persons were frequently attacked He is a young man, a little over sixteen years old, peacable and of good character, and we recommend that the fine be remitted</p>
