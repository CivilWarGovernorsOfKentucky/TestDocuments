   <p>To his Excellency, Governor Magoffin:</p>
<p>Thomas M Freeman states that on the <gap/> day of <date when="1861-11">November 1861</date>, he was by the Police Court of Lawrenceburg fined <hi rend="underline">eleven dollars and five cents</hi> on a charge of a breach of the Peace, originating in a difficulty with J. W. Lane. It grew out of a conversation on political subjects; but the affray which ensued was not caused by any misconduct of the undersigned. When reading an account of the inauguration of a provisional government by the convention at Russellville, the undersigned expressed his condemnation of said movement and the famlies engaged in it, and for this expression of his sentiments, he was assulted by said Lane. I acted on the defensive, and did nothing to invite or justify the attack on me. Lane was acquitted by the jury, while the affiant, was fined the above mentioned sum.</p>
<p>Affiant is so circumstanced that he would not be able to pay the fine without much inconvience, and being conscious of his innocence he respectfully asks for a remission of said fine. </p>
<p>Tho. M. Freeman</p>
