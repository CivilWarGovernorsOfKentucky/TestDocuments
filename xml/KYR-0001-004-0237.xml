<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>Thomas E Bramlette Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>your Petitioner Sylvia W. Mottley of Green County would respectfully represent that some time since one John A Miller a relative of hers was arrested in Adair County under the charge of Felony and was required to give Bail for his appearance in the adair circuit court in the penalty &amp; bond of $200 -- That at her instance and request one L. Hartfield George W Cale &amp; T A Hatcher became bound in said Bail bond as sureties</p>
<p>She agreeing to indemnify and bear them Harmless. She states that said Miller has failed to appear in discharge of his s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> bond and it was forfeited and none She believes Judgment has gone against said sureties and they will shortly be called on for payment which of Cause She will have to raise according to her agreement</p>
<p>She will not attempt to paltiate the crime with which said Miller was charged but being related to him, and feeling a deep sympathy for his kindred who reside in Virginia all of whom are respectable. She was induced to incur the liability above named under ordinary circumstances<pb/></p>
<p>She would not appeal to your Excellency but she is constrained to do so; She states. that she, as well as the Surities in said bond, have suffered greatly from depredations committed upon thier property &amp; means within the last year. She is now in her last &amp; declining years, in bad health and altho She has been bless with a bountiful supply in years past, it is fast wasting away. She will of course be compelled to pay the cost and per cent to the officers of the Court &amp; attorney for the Comth which is now a tolerably large item.</p>
<p>She prays your Excellency to take her case into your favorable consideration and to remit said forfeiture and to release the securities in said bond from the payment thereof cost &amp; fees Excepted and for which and as in duty bound She will ever pray.</p>

<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>Thos E Bramlette Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Dr Sir</p>
<p>I have been induced to get this petition and write to you on account of the extreme old age and the very feeble health of my Aunt Mrs Mottley you know her from caracter if not personally and while all the rest of the family have been Southern sympathizers she has been firm for the union, and now she is in very feeble health this thing gives her much trouble if it was not a matter that was preying upon her hourly I would not trouble you, but under the circumstances I hope you will give the matter a favourable consideration</p>
<p>&amp; oblige yours Truly &amp;C

<lb/>His Excellency Governor Bramlette</p>
<p>Dear Sir The within petition was left with me with request to forward to you which I respectfully do. I know nothing about the facts presented, except that I know pretty much the condition of Mrs Mottley she is now very feeble &amp; infirm, very old, and is much annoyed by the condition she finds herself in about this case, and it would greatly relieve her to know that her case has met with a favorable response from you. Should your Excellency see cause to notice this case favorably, please inclose to myself or Mr R O Hundly at this place</p>
<p>very respectfully S A Spencer</p>
<p>To His Excellency
