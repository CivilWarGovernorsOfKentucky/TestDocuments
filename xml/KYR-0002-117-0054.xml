<lb/>Maj. Gen. N. J. T. Dana -- U. S. Vols.
<lb/>Galt House -- Louisville -- Ky.
<lb/>General,</p>
<p>Your letter of the <date when="1864-05-08">8<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> inst.</date> has been received and shown His Excellency Gov. Bramlette, who has directed its immediate answer.</p>
<p>There are, now, no new organizations of troops in Kentucky. A call was made -- as you are aware -- a few days since for 10.000 six months' troops. None of these have as yet been organized. The Governor expects to succeed in getting a large proportion of those troops during this Month -- by volunteering. They will rendezvous at the points indicated in the accompanying order, each of which is a Military post.</p>
<p>The 4<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky. Infty Vols. -- now at Lexington -- is the only veteran regiment of our State now at home. It has largely recruited, and is a fine corps. The universial designations of the regiments to be organized under the call for six months' troops, have not been determined yet, nor can they be until <unclear/> <unclear/> <unclear/>. Any further information you may wish <unclear/> in the power of the State authorities, you may require, to expedite the objects of your mission will be heartily given. We are anxious to give every aid to the great work, now hastening, as we trust is its end.</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Your obt Serv't
