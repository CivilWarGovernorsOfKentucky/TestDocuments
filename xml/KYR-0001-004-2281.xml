   <p>Morganfield Ky -- 
<lb/><date when="1865-08-07">August 7th 1865</date>
<lb/>Messrs Harlan &amp; Harlan</p>
<p>Gentlemen = John A Brooks who had been a promising Young lawyer of the Webster county bar in <date when="1862">1862</date> joined the Regiment made by Adam Johnson for the confederate Service from this &amp; the adjacent counties -- He was afterwards indicted by the grand jury of Webster county for Robbery, that is pressing horses as a confederate soldier -- He had however before the indictments given himself up, taken the oath, given bond, &amp; returned to his home, business and familly. Other persons situated as Brooks was and under the same charges have been cleared here by the courts upon the grounds that the horses pressed by him had been taken under orders from superiors in military command -- </p>
<p>Vance of Henderson and Spalding &amp; myself of this place were his counsel &amp; had no doubt of acquitting him. We want his bail in <date when="1864-03">March 1864</date> in the two indictments of $500 each case for his appearance<pb/>
<lb/>at the next term -- In the mean time the county here and especially in Webster county became the scene of a reigh of Terror -- Soldiers on both sides were commiting unheard of outrages upon the citizens, and especially was there an extreme vindictiveness on the part of Union soldiers toward those who had been in the rebel service -- I send you copies of the indictments &amp; also affidavits in regard to Brooks -- </p>
<p>There was no court in <hi rend="str">October</hi>, <date when="--09">September</date>, but at <date when="1865-03">March Term 1865</date> the bonds were taken as forfeited -- Brooks has acted badly by us he is in Colorado, went there immediately, whether he intends to return or not I can not say -- I suppose he went in the belief that the war would last a long while &amp; to get clear away from the trouble -- Is there any possibility before judgement on the bonds to get them remitted -- if not so, then to have the judgements respited for 12 months to enable us to get Brooks here = If you can do so us any service in this matter we the three V -- S &amp; myself<pb/>
<lb/>will pay you a handsome fee for yr services = anything which you may think it necessary for us to do let me <unclear>hear one</unclear> and I will be prompt -- If my presence in Frankfort would advance our suit with the Gov -- I will come up immediately -- We must hasten this matter as the court sits 2nd monday in <date when="--09">September</date></p>
<p>Get me out of this blamed scrape if you can and as in duty bound I will ever be</p>
<p>Yrs &amp;c
<lb/>D H Hughes</p>
