<lb/>M C Davis
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I received your most welcome letter last evening and was much gratified to hear from old Dixon once more. I was some what surprised to hear that my bond had been forfeited. I was certain that it would not be attempted having to leave as I did. I could not remain longer in safety, threatened as I was by both sides. Though I trust that judgement will not be rendered against me at the next Court. It will be utterly impossible for me to be there<pb/>
<lb/>at court to be there it would be necessary for me to start this week and the numerous bands of Indians now prowling upon the road would make it dangerous and even hazardous to start I trust that the Comth Atty will consider all the circumstances under which I was placed at least before he ask's for judgement.</p>
<p>I think I will be in Ky. about Christmas perhaps not before February,</p>
<p>I am doing very will out here. I would not take less than Fifty Thousand Dollars for all my property here. I have some very rich lodes and I think they will be worth a fortune in a year or two some<pb/>
<lb/>have sold as high as Five hundred thousand Dollars and I think that I have equally as good, I am gulch mining at present I am taking out <hi rend="str">about</hi> from $6 to $10 per day to the hand</p>
<p>I was truly sorry to hear of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cosbys misfortune more especially the giving publicity to his person perhap there are some spots not far from Dixon that would have suited the D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> much better to have been exhibited at, but misfortune happens to all, I have written to Judge Cook and expect an answer soon.</p>
<p>I wish you would let me know the date of Claytons and Gains death<pb/>
<lb/>was it upon the reception of the News of Lee's Surrender or Davis's Capture, I am Almost Convinced that they have long since made their exit from this to an eternal world, If it should so turn out that they are not dead please present them with my respects and say to them not be be <hi rend="underline">discourage</hi> <hi rend="underline">that</hi> <hi rend="underline">the</hi> <hi rend="underline">report</hi> <hi rend="underline">is</hi> <hi rend="underline">all</hi> <hi rend="underline">ficticious</hi> <hi rend="underline">Lee</hi> <hi rend="underline">has</hi> <hi rend="underline">not</hi> <hi rend="underline">Surrendered</hi> <hi rend="underline">nor likely</hi> <hi rend="underline">too</hi> <hi rend="underline">and</hi> <hi rend="underline">that</hi> <hi rend="underline">there</hi> <hi rend="underline">is</hi> <hi rend="underline">a</hi> <hi rend="underline">bright</hi> <hi rend="underline">future</hi> <hi rend="underline">in</hi> <hi rend="underline">store for</hi> <hi rend="underline">them</hi> hoping thus you all may be able at the coming election to adopt the Constitutional Amendment and forever restore peace and harmony to the now distracted condition of Ky</p>
<p>I am Yours Truly
