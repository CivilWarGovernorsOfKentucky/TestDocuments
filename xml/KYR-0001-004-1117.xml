   <p>Mt. Sterling Ky. <date when="1864-08">Aug. 1864.</date>
<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Gov. Thos. E. Bramblette
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>The undersigned, your petitioners, would respectfully state that Enoch S. Reid was fined at the <date when="1864-08">present August term</date> of the Montogmery Circuit Court the sum of Sixty ($60) dollars on an indictment by a grand Jury for the offence of keeping a "Tippling House". Mr. Reid had obtained a merchants license and was conducting a dry goods &amp; Grocery store in this County. About the <date when="1864-01-01">first of January last,</date> during that excessive cold weather Mr. T. B. Oldham &amp; Carlton McDaniel, two sober &amp; exemplary citizens of our County, were dealing largely in stock for the Government &amp;c, <hi rend="str">and being very much chilled by the</hi> and consequently owing to the nature of their business were compelled to be out in that inclement weather &amp; passing by young Reids store, and being very much chilled they concluded to stop &amp; get some spirits. They called for a glass &amp; being neighbors &amp; acquaintances of Reids, a glassful of spirits was handed them &amp; after drinking they handed his clerk a dime &amp; passed on.</p>
<p>Young Reid is a man of good moral character, had been engaged in the business of a Merchant &amp; Grocer less than a year previous to this time, &amp; shortly after <hi rend="str">the selling</hi> letting Oldham &amp; Mc.Daniel have the glass of spirits, his store House took fire &amp; burned down &amp; all his goods and groceries were consumed. Having but little property before, this misfortune reduced him to very low pecuniary Circumstances. He has entirely abandoned dealing in spiritous liquors, and under all the foregoing Circumstances we think his is a case that will fully justify executive clemency, wherefore we your petitioners pray that you will extend the same to him, thereby remitting so much<pb/>
<lb/>of said fine of $60.00 as you are by law &amp; by virtue of your Office authorized to do &amp; oblige your petitioners most respectfully Yours</p>
<p>The facts stated in the above petition are correct

<p>We, T. B. Oldham &amp; Carlton Mc,Daniel, fully Concur in the foregoing statements &amp; the objects of said petition &amp; would further state that the facts set forth touching our purchase of the glass of spirits are correct &amp; that at the time we had no thought of violating the law <hi rend="str">neither did it occur to us at the time, that by leaving the ten cents with the clerk, that it was a violation of law upon his part to receive it</hi>, Hence as the whole thing was done innocently on our part and no doubt also on the part of Reid,s clerk, we pray as in the petition</p>
