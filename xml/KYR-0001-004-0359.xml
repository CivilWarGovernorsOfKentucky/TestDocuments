<lb/>Lyon County } Sct.</p>
<p>Affiant N T. Braswell states that he has made every exertion to get Charles Braswell before the Lyon Circuit Court to answer the charges, prefered against him, but has failed from the fact that said Charles Braswell is now &amp; has been for <gap/> years in the Naval service of the Government of the United States, that when heard from last he was commissioned as an officer on one ^of^ the <hi rend="str">Ironclad</hi> Gun Boats, in the south Mississippi River, that he will obtain proof of the fact and forward the same to Frankfort if required to do so. He further states that said Charles Braswell obtained permission to visit and did visit Eddyville Ky. for the purpose of answering said charges, but <hi rend="str">was unavoidably delayed</hi> ^was mistaken in the time of holding court,^ and did not arrive until one day after his bond was forfeited, He states that owing to Charles Brawell being in said service he is entirely unable to coerce his attendance to answer said charges. He further states that he has good reasons to believe and does firmly believe that said charges are utterly groundless, and that said Charles Braswell is entirely innocent of the said charges.</p>
<p>He states that it will be a great hardship if he is compeled to pay the forfeited bond -- He states that he has paid #150 of the bond forfeited leaving #350 unpaid.</p>
