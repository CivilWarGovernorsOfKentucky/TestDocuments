<lb/>Dear Sir -- </p>
<p>Last week E. M. Wilson of this County was fined $25 -- in the Court of G. L. Harbison Esq. for an alleged assault on one T. G. Doolin -- And the neighbors of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Wilson signed a petition to your excellency to remit the fine, and it was handed to me for delivery to you.</p>
<p>The individuals who signed the petition were among the best men of our country. Myself &amp; Judge wheat signed the petition I was so unfortunate as to loose the petition after it was placed in my possession, and to save trouble in preparing another, &amp; trusting our respresentation will prove as satisfactory to you as the original petition we ask you to interpose in behalf of Mr Wilson, who is a very poor and hard-working man -- </p>
<p>Very respectfully
<lb/>T. B. Cochran
<lb/>Z. Wheat</p>
<p>P, S, I did not Sign the original Petition but Concur in the above request.</p>
<p>Truly
