<p>Your petitioners would further represent to your Excellency that sd Jessee M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cormick was a young man Just grown to manhood and ^was^ easily alarmed &amp; was influenced by some evil disposed persons to leave the Country and not stand his trial. They would further represent, that all the parties above mentioned against whom said forfeiture was taken, are poor men with Families to support except William<pb/>
<lb/>Halsell who is in moderately good circumstances, to pay said amount of four hundred dollars would be very oppressive upon them, your Excellency gave a respite some time since of Twelve months which time has nearly elapsed They would feel under lasting obligations if your Excellency would relieve them altogether from the payment of said sum of Four hundred Dollars</p>

<p>I state that I was the County Attorney and prosecuted Jessee M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cormick in the Examining Court, and from the proof that was introduced on the trial I feel confident that on the final trial he would have been acquitted</p>
