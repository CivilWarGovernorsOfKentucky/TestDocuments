<lb/>Hon B. Magoffin, 
<lb/>Gov. of Ky.</p>
<p>My dear Sir- The friends of Rufus Jones, now confined in the penitentiary at Frankfort for the killing of Henry Jenkins, believe his is a case in which it would be just &amp; proper to interpose Executive clemency. It would be very gratifying to me &amp; his numerous friends &amp; family relatives if you can so view it. I am not familiar with the facts as proved in his trial, but from what I can learn it was one of those unpremeditated &amp; impulsive acts, under the influence of exciting liquors &amp; a boisterous crowd which the best men might sometimes commit. He certainly had no malice toward young Jenkins with whom he had, from childhood, been upon term of the most friendly &amp; almost brotherly relations. His youth, his feeble constitution &amp; his before that unstained reputation, together with the facts of the case &amp; his very numerous &amp; highly respectable connexions I hope will induce your Excellency to pardon him -- </p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Yr Obt Svt
<lb/>B. N. Covington</p>
