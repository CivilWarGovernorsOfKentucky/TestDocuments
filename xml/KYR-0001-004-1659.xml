   <p>Walker White states on oath that his son has at different times kept bar for different individuals and amongst the number Jonathan Raley -- He has also drank at Raley's bar by my consent and I permitted him to drink and trade for himself and at the <date when="1865-03">march</date> circuit ^court^ for Ohio county the said Raley was fined for letting him have liquor, being a minor -- Raley is a very poor man and I feel satisfied that at the time my son got the liquor, he Raley, intended no harm to me or him or to violate the laws, but felt authorised from my conduct to let him have it -- I am a neighbor and Raley is unable to pay the debt -- </p>
