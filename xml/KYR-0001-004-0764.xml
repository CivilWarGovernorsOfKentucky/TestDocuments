   <p>To His Excellency Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. Bramlet
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Ky.</p>
<p>Your petitioners would respectfully represent to your Excellency that at the <date when="1864-04">April term 1864</date> of the Union Circuit Court. Robert Ransom was convicted of suffering and permitting gaming in his house at which whiskey Brandy and Beer was won and lost. Under the instructions of the Court, the Jury were bound to find him guilty and affixed the lowest penalty of the law to wit two Hundred dollars. We are convinced from the Evidence that Mr Ransom did ^not^ intend or contemplate a breach of law in allowing said games and that the fine is greatly too large and onerous for the offence We therefore pray your Excellency to remit said fine and we of the Jury who were impaneled in and tried said case recommend Mr Ransom to the clemency of Your Excellency and in our opinion have no hesitancy in saying that he is worthy of it and that clemency should be extended to him All of which is respectfully submitted</p>
