<lb/>To his Excellency the

<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>We the Citizens of the State of Kentucky residing in the immediate vicinity of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> A Clark. who has been fined by the <hi rend="str">Circut</hi> Circuit Court of Pendleton County ^at the <date when="1862-04">april term 1862</date>^ for selling liquor without license,= The said Clark came into our State in the year <date when="1861">1861</date> and commenced putting up a house for the purpose of keeping a tavern, and as soon as he had the necessary facilities for so doing, he then took out license,</p>
<p>The penalty against him is $200,,<hi rend="sup">00</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi> which we do think is entirely out of reason.= M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Clark is a man ^that is 19 years old and^ that bears a good reputation among us, and did not think that he was commiting a breach of the law as it was his intention to take out license as soon as his house was prepared -- </p>
<p>We respectfully pray you, for the remission of his fine, (believing that those who testified against him. done it out of personal ill will) and we remain obedient Servants</p>
