<p>About a year ago or a little over Mrs Berling wife of Henry Berling who is now at my office Informs me her Husband sent a Petition asking the remission of a fine of $50:00<unclear/> assessed against him in the city court For selling Liquor to a slave &amp; that you respited the collection of the fine for one year which has expired, She begs me to pray you to look at the Petition now &amp; remit the fine.</p>
<p>Her husband has sometime since closed his coffee house &amp; is at work as a day laborer &amp; that they are wholy unable to pay the Fine:</p>
<p>I know Berling He is an Industrious clever German, poor, &amp; has a family of small children. He is worthy of your clemency.</p>
