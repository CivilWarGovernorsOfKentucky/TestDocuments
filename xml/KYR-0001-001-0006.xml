   <p>COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY,
<lb/>EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,
<lb/>Frankfort, Ky., <date when="1864-11-16">Nov. 16th, 1864.</date></p>
<p>Thursday, the <date when="1864-11-24">24th inst.,</date> having been set apart by the Proclamation of the President of the United States to be observed as a day of National Thanksgiving and Prayer, it should be so observed by all the citizens of Kentucky, with that becoming reverence and thankfulness to Almighty God for His manifold mercies bestowed, even while scourging us with war.</p>
<p>We should praise and thank Him that we are yet preserved as a Nation, and that the hope of a preserved nationality, and a restored unity and peace to our distracted country, is still kept -- as the Vestal flame -- aglow in the hearts of the people. As a People and a Nation we have much -- very much -- for which to give Him thanks and praise, not only for blessings bestowed upon us, but for evils which He has withheld.</p>
<p>Let, therefore, all business pursuits be suspended on THURSDAY, the <date when="1864-11-24">24th inst.,</date> and all the people, with devout hearts of thankfulness to "Him whose ways are not as man's ways," assemble at their respective places of worship, and offer thanksgiving and praise to Him for the blessings He has bestowed and the evils He hath withheld ; and pray that He will so order the issues of battle, and the councils of State, as to give to us a restoration of our national unity in the bonds of brotherly peace.</p>
<p>THOS. E. BRAMLETTE,
<lb/><hi rend="italic">Governor of Kentucky</hi>.<pb/></p>
<p>Proclamation By the Governor
