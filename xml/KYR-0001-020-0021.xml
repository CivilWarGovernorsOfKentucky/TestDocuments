   <p>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin 
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Caldwell County Kentucky have long known Thomas B Wadlington &amp; he has ever been considered, a good &amp; true hearted citizen, Known &amp; noted for his industry &amp; orderly conduct. The dificulty in which he was engaged with Milton A Cartwright did not appear to be of his seeking, nor are we satisfied that the case was presented to the Jury as it really occured. We hope your excellency will revew the case &amp; give the poor man the benefit of every doubt we desire that his case may be judged in mercy &amp; regarded with favor. We hope that your excellency will take into consideration every circumstance, that ought to opperate in his behalf. And we desire that your excellency may &amp; will be persuaded, that it is consistent with your duty to extend to him Executive Clemency &amp; that his life life may be sparred, either by granting him a full pardon or by a commutation of his punish<pb/>
<lb/> -- punishment. </p>
