   <p>STATE OF INDIANA,
<lb/>Adjutant General's Office,
<lb/>Indianapolis, <date when="1864-07-02">July 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 1864</date>
<lb/>His Exc. Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> E. Bramlette
<lb/>Gov of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir,</p>
<p>We are experiencing serious apprehensions of danger along our Southern border from the guerilla operations in Meade Breckenridge Hancock and Davies County Ky, Our people are excited and have demanded that measures be devised to give them protection, In a few days we shall send Officers to Floyd Harrison Crawford Perry &amp; Spencer County to look more closely into affairs and if necessary place some force on duty at prominent points on the river..</p>
<p>By direction of Gov. Morton I respectfully ask your co-operation &amp; to restore quiet if possible in the Counties ennumerated on your side of the river by organizing a portion of your state Militia for active duty during the summer.</p>
<p>I will address a letter to Gen. Ewing on the subject of which I will enclose a<pb/>
<lb/>copy embracing the principle grounds of complaint forwarded from that part of our state.</p>
<p>The restrictions placed by St. Fitch commanding the Gunboats on personal intercourse creates very great dissatisfaction and we fear is unwise and unnecessary. A few prominent men of well known secession sympathies seem to be favored whilst union men of less note but truer friends to our government are not in any wise favored.</p>
<p>The complaints came in such a shape that Gov. Morton feels constrained to send and enquire into them and he would be glad to have your co-operation.</p>
<p>Very respfy
<lb/>Your obt. servant
<lb/>Laz Noble
<lb/>Adj Gen. Ind</p>
  </body>
