<lb/>To His Excellency 
<lb/>The Governor of Ky
<lb/>Dear sir:</p>
<p>When I was attorney for the Commonwealth many years ago a negro man named Jourdan was convicted ^in The Scott Court^ for killing a slave belonging to <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> Mr Offutt I believe, It has been so long ago that I cannot remember the proof accurately, but I have a general recollection that the prisoner proved a good general character upon the trial and that there were many mitigating facts proven in -- his defence. And I learn that the judge who presided at the trial and the jury have petitioned for his pardon upon certain terms. </p>
<p>I cheerfully join in the petition for his pardon -- </p>
<p>Yours Respectfully 
<lb/><hi rend="underline">R. H. Hanson</hi></p>
