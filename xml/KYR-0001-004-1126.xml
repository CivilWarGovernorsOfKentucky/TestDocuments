   <p>To his Excellency the Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>The undersigned were members of the Jury empannelled in the Case of the Commonwealth against John Mackin at the <date when="1864-08">August Term of the Marion Circuit Court 1864.</date> on an indictment for permitting Thomas Weatherford a minor, to play upon his Pigeon hole table, and they would say that from the Evidence they believe that at the time the playing by said Minor was done said Mackin did not know that there was any statute prohibiting it, being instructed however that ignorance of the law was no excuse for the commission of an offence, they were constrained to find him Guilty and assessed his fine at $5.<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi>, they understand that his conviction works a forfeiture of his right to keep the table unless pardoned by the Governor. They would therefore ask under the Circumstances that your Excellency grant to said Mackin a full pardon --
