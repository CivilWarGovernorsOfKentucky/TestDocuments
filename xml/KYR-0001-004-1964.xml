<p>Govenor.</p>
<p>I have left for your consideration a Petition for W. J. Myers &amp; Mrs Moore. both of whom are Residents of Pendleton County -- The Pet will explain itsself -- I had leave to submit an additional statement of my-own I am well acquainted with Mrs Moore as I am also with King Plummer King Plummer married a daughter of Mrs Moore -- and it now turns out that he was a married man at the time he married Miss Moore. and was Indicted for Bigamy -- he was arrested &amp; W. J. Myers entered on the Bond as Bail -- he is the Brother of Mrs Moore and Mrs Moore indemnified her Brother W. J. Myers. before he would enter as Bail shortly after the execution of the Bond<pb/>
<lb/>Plummer entered the United states service where he served out about eighteen months was in the 40<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Regt. shortly after his discharge he was taken sick at the Regular Term <date when="1865-04">(april) 1865</date> of the Pendleton Circuit Court. Plummer was sick. &amp; the Bond forfeited -- and the Bench warrant issued and was executed Mr. Moore &amp; W. J Myers again entered as Bail -- and in a few days the s<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Court reassembled and Plummer failed to appear. and the Bond was forfeited -- He is now gone to parts unknown. Mrs. Moore has her Daughter with her -- and she has declined liveing with Plummer longer -- She is an ameiable woman -- and has to look to her widowed mother Mrs Moore (The Petitioner) for a support -- who if she has to pay these Bonds. will not be able to render her a subsistence -- Myers although on the Bond will not loose one cent -- I know these facts be cause I have acted as counsel for Plummer during the whole time -- I therefore earnestly request your Excellency -- to remit &amp; cancel the two Bonds -- This will be right as all know who are at all familiar with the history of the case.</p>
