<p>We whose names are hereto Subscribed are Citizens of Clinton Ky and state that Some time about Christmas last, John C Akin who is a very Steady and inoffensive Citizen of Our town. was visited in the night time by a man of said town and threatened very severly. and in the next day Said John C Akin hapened to meet with this individual who again made use of threats &amp;c. upon which said Akin Struck at him and Missed him for which offense said Akin was was arrested tried and fined the sum of fifteen Dollars besides costs. which trial was had befor Judge W F Boon the <date when="1861-02-05">5 day of February 1861</date>.</p>
<p>We would further state that said Akin is a man of a family and very poor and is in bad health he is a mechanic and it is all that he can do to make a support for himself &amp; family. and we think that the fine was exessive and that it would be a Great relef to him &amp; family that you Remit the Same &amp; injustice would not be done to the Commonwealth. <date when="1861-03-13">March 13. 1861</date>.</p>
