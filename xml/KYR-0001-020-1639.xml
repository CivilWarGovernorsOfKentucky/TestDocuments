   <p>Newport. Ky <date when="1862-01-07">January 7<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> 1862</date>.
<lb/>His Excellency. Gov. Magoffin
<lb/>Hon Sir</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Nancy Gilson would respectfully represent that my husband James Gilson was on the <gap/> day of <date when="1861-10">October 1861</date> fined by the Mayor of the City of Newport the sum of Fifteen Dollars for abusing his family (myself). The facts in the case are these, my husband and myself had some little difference about family affairs some meddlesome neighbours who bore no good will to my husband took advantage of the circumstances and entered complaint before the Mayor. The prosecution was without my consent or approbation. I did not appear at the trial. My husband is an industrious Kind helpmate always making ample provision for his family and has ever treated myself and children with care &amp; kindness. we both feel deeply mortified at the infliction of the penalty and exposure of our family before the public at this time owing to the stagnation in business hereabouts my husband being a Mechanic the payment of the fine would press heavily on us. I would therefore pray your excellency to use your clemency in his &amp; our behalf.</p>
<p>I am with profound respect your Excellency's obedient Servant.
<lb/>Nany Gelson
<lb/>Mary E Gelson
<lb/>James Gelson a mecanik</p>
<p>We the Undersigned well and personally acquainted with Petitioners would state that M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Nancy Gillson is a very worthy and deserving lady and her husband a clever Gentleman and we would respectfully Join in their request.</p>
