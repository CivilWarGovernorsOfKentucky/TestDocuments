   <p>To His Excellenc B. Magoffin
<lb/>Gov'r of the Com'th of Ky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner James Doyle represents that that he was on the <date when="1862-08-08">8<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> instant</date> fined the sum of <hi rend="underline">twenty</hi> <hi rend="underline">five</hi> <hi rend="underline">dollars</hi> and costs in police court of the city of Frankfort for a breech of the peace -- He says that he went with a friend to a house of ill fame, that his friend knew an inmate thereof, and wished to see her that his friends rapped on the door and his acquaintance come out to meet him, and that, some other women who were there, opened an other door and commenced a fuss by screaming and loud talking and that immediately thereupon your petitioner took to his heels and made his escape -- he Says that he did not enter the house and himself made no disturbance whatever, did nothing but enter on the lot, and leave immediately he perceived there was likely to be a disturbance, and for being in bad company -- or rather near to it, he<pb/>
<lb/>was fined the aforesaid sum of twenty five dollars &amp; costs; wherefore in as much, as your petitioner is a poor -- laboring man, and unable to pay the fine and costs and he has no other means left, he appeals to your clemency, and even justice to release and acquit him from the payment of the same, for it was wrongfully imposed on him -- he having no witnesses, being taken up in the same warrant with his friend -- </p>

<p>Sworn to before me this <gap/> day of <date when="1862-08">August 1862</date><pb/></p>
<p>In whose names are herewith subscribed join in the prayer of the petitioner, and respectfully request your Exc'y to remit the fine in as much as we know the petitioner to be a peaceable and truthful man, tho; a poor one, and therefore under the circumstances, in view his poverty and want of knowledge should be in our opinion pardoned respectfully your friend &amp;c</p>
