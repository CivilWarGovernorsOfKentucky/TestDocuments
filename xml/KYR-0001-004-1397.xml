   <p>Falmouth Pendleton County Ky
<lb/><date when="1864-12-16">Dec: 16/64</date>
<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Tho E Bramlette Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of Ky</p>
<p>Inclosed please find the petition of Jerry Shehon, asking a remission of a judgment upon a forfeited peace recognisence or Bond taken <hi rend="str">by</hi> <hi rend="str">F</hi>before F F Wallace a justice of the peace, in favour of the Comlth against him, and returned to the Circuit Court,</p>
<p>The justice himself, in verification of the statements of the Petition signs it; also the Attorney of the County the two Clerks of the County and Circuit Courts, and myself unite with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sheehon, in involving the executive clemency knowing, Sheehon, to be a peaceable well disposed citizen; and an extremely poor, sober and industrious man; and with all of great ignorance, as to the laws and habits of this Country's and also fully persuaded, that if it had not been for the instructions and assurances of the justice, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Wallace<pb/>
<lb/>he would have attended, the Court and with no prosecution appearing (and none did appear) the cause, would have been dismissed -- Moreover, he will not be the sufferer, so much, as his wife &amp; children in these difficult times for the poore and humble; since perhaps all the little personalties he has got in ^the world,^ would not pay the debt -- </p>
<p>Respectfully Your<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Servt
