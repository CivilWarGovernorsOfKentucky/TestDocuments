   <p>To His Excy. B. Magoffin Gov'r of the Com'th of Ky -- </p>
<p>Your petitioner, respectfully represent that at the <gap/> term of the Franklin Circuit court <date when="1861">1861.</date> Lawrence Tobin was fined the sum of sixty dollars for keeping a tippling house -- The proof showed that he had sold only two drinks to a man who has been in the habit of frequently calling there for whisky -- there was no proof that he had sold any spirituous liquors to any one except that com'ths witness there was no proof that he was in habit of selling contray to law -- none that he was fixed &amp; for retailing -- none that he had a bar, glasses or bottle, or any of the usul furniture of a liquor seller -- but that the liquor sold was drawn from a barell -- and the whole tendency of the proof was to establish the fact that he sold only to get clear of frequent calls to give away liquor and that only on two occasions<pb/>
<lb/>wherefore in view of the premises and in as much as the said Tobin did not intend to violate the Law and in as much as he is illy able to pay the fine and barely came by one drink within the statute, It is prayed that his fine be remitted &amp;c </p>
