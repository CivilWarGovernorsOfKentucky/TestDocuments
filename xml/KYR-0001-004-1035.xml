   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E Bramlette Govenor of the commonweth of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>Your petitioners respectfully represent that W. G. Gray was indicted in the Police Court of the City of Louisville for an assault &amp; battery on W. A. Ronald and that at the <date when="--07">July</date> term of said court, on a plea of guilty he was fined the sum of Two hundred dollars.</p>
<p>Your petitioners state that it was represented to the said W. G. Gray that W A Ronald had made statements derogetory to the reputation of Said Gray, in the presence of several gentlemen in the city of Frankfort, in the absence of the said Gray, &amp; that the said Gray took by the collar the said Ronald, on his Return from Frankfort, and Ronald being unable to give a satisfactory reason for his conduct &amp; statements at Frankfort, the said Gray gave him a slight chastisement, by inflicting on him one, &amp; perhaps two blows with a small walking cane.</p>
<p>Wherefore, in view of the premises, in as much there was no serious injury of any kind done to Ronald, we deem the fine exessive &amp; unjust and pray your Excellency to remit and forever acquit the said Gray from the payment of the same, and we will for ever pray as in duty bound &amp;C</p>
