<lb/>Dear Sir.</p>
<p>Not having any acquaintance and having a little business officially would state to you that at the <date when="--11">November Term</date> of our Caldwell Circuit Court I was fined $10. &amp; cost for gaming, the truth is there was several of us in together, and myself and one other was all that was indicted or fined we were not really playing for any thing, only what a man might eat and drink for instance a game of euchre, and the person beat saw proper to treat he did so if not he did not I think we were presented an account of some impartialty in the matter perhaps some one was sitting bye at the time outsider &amp; did not understand the matter." I live in the country &amp; just came to town &amp; got into the game not in the habbitt of playing often." there fore I hope and trust you will remit my fine of $10. and in so doing you will</p>
<p>oblige &amp;c -- 
<lb/>J W Wylie</p>
<p>I believe the statements as made by Mr ^Wylie^ to be true as he is a man of good standing &amp; reputation</p>
