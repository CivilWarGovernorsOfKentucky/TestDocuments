   <p>Harrison County Ky.
<lb/><date when="1863-05">May 1863</date>.
<lb/>To Gov. Robinson</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Harrison County, would respectfully represent to your Excellency that at the fall term of the Scott Circuit Court, in the year <gap/>, Victor Philips <hi rend="str">a native</hi> who was born and reared in this County, was convicted of felony and sentenced to a confinement in the Penitentiary for the term of five years. Your Peti^ti^oners learn that his conduct whilst a prisoner <hi rend="str">his conduct</hi> has been very exemplary, thereby obtaining the good opinion and sympathy of the keepers and the Ministers who there officiate. Therefore in view of the fact that we believe he has fully expiated for the offence with which he was charged, if guilty, and that the end of justice have been answered in his case, we respectfully pray your excellency to exericse the clemency with which you are clothed by granting to him a pardon for the remaining portion of the time for which he was sentenced, and restore him to his rights as a citizen and to his young wife and friends, and as in duty bound we will ever pray &amp;c.</p>
