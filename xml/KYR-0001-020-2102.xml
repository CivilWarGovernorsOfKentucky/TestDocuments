   <p>Georgetown Ky <date when="1862-08-08">Aug 8th 1862</date>
<lb/>To his Excellency, Beriah M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin Govenor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioners would Respectfully Represent to your excellency, that at the <date when="1862-02">Feby</date> term of the Cambell Circuit Court Leonidus Mefford and Wm Tapp two worthy and Respectible Citizens of the County of Scott became the sureties of D F. Mefford for his appearance in said Court at its <date when="1862-02">February term 1862</date> to answer a charge of passing counterfeit money in the penalty of five hundred dollars, but said D F Mefford failed to appear, in consequence of being unable to procure the attendance of the witnesses, by whom he alledges he would have been able to have proven himself innocent of the charge alledged against him, and for the further Reason that he was assured that he would <hi rend="str">have</hi> <hi rend="str">been</hi> be arrested on a charge of complicity with the southern Confederacy, and a fair trial denied him, and he in all probability confined in prison without an oportunity of vindicating his innocence.</p>
<p>Your Petitioners would further Represent that said Leonidus Meffort and Wm Tapp who are now summoned to answer the forfeited bond, ^are illy able to pay said sum of $500^ or even the percentage to which<pb/>
<lb/>the Commonwealths Atty would be entitled, Respectfully ask an interposition of your executive clemency to shield them from the suspended blow which is hanging over the said Mefford and Tapp, who have commiitted no offence, and violated no Law.</p>
<p>Respectfully</p>
