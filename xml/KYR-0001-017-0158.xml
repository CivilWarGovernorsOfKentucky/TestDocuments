   <p>Louisville Ky
<lb/><date when="1861-05-17">May 17. 1861.</date>
<lb/>A. J. James, Esqr.
<lb/>Frankfort Ky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Permit me to address you on a subject of some importance to myself it is as follows -- In the early part of <date when="1861-04">April</date> I applied to his Excellency the Governor of Ky for the appointment of magistrate (vacant) of the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> &amp; 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> wards of the city of Louisville &amp; recommended by my Friends Ja<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. Speed, Hy Dent, and W. H. Harvey, Esq<hi rend="sup">es</hi> of this city. His Excellency was kind enough to grant me the appointment on the <date when="1861-04-16">16<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> of April</date> but my not being notified of my being appointed I of course did not know anything about it till I heard yesterday by mere accident that my commission was lying in the County Co Office I went there, obtained it, &amp; was qualified by oath <date when="1861-05-16">May 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> and this morning heard to my astonishment that I was too late in my qualification for that commission now there was no order issued for an Election of magistrate at the <date when="1861-05-04">May 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date> Election I respectfully ask you to interest yourself in my behalf<pb/>
<lb/>with the Governor for another commission as I lost the other by expecting to have received the commission <unclear>in</unclear> mail directed to me the exertion of your kindness in my case will ever oblige</p>
<p>yrs most Respectfully
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi>. Mitchell</p>
<p>See 1 Stant Rev. Statutes p. 441 ยง 5 -- Sub Sec 2</p>
<p>The first commissipon having Expired and no incumbent Elected, at <date when="1861-05">May</date> election, the office is again vacant (ib. page 439.) and another commission can be issued to Esq<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Mitchell till August election</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">A. J. J</hi>.</p>
<p>Since making the above memorandum, (which I made without any other information than the within letter) I see by certificates of the county Judge and clerk that another was elected at <date when="1861-05">May</date> election without any writ of Election -- This election without a writ was irregular -- but the Gov. has the power to confirm it by commissioning the individual elected if he thinks proper.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">A. J. J</hi>.</p>
