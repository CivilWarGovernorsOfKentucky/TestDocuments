   <p>Louisville Ky <date when="1865-06-19">June 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1865.</date>
<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Hon Thos E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Ky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>The undersigned would respectfully represent that she has been warranted by the city of Louisville &amp; fined the sum of $10 for "allowing standing water &amp; putrifying matter on her lot, on the corner of Floyd &amp; Green sts in said city -- " The Marshal of the city court of Louisville has informed her of the fact of the fine. Your petitioner would state that on coming to a knowledge that she had been warranted on the subject of this nuisance she visited the judge of the city court &amp; was by him informed that there was no case against her, as she was not the owner of the property &amp; he promised to dismiss the case, resting under this impression &amp; promise she did not defend the suit, but she is informed that when it came up for trial, the Mayor of the city sat in the case decided it against her &amp; fined her $10. Had she not been under this impression, she would have appeared by her Att<hi rend="sup">y</hi> &amp; been able to show that she was not the owner of the property on which the nuisance was alledged to exist &amp; for which she was fined, but that said property had passed, by deed made in <date when="1860">1860</date> from her Father D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. James C Johnston, her brothers W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> &amp; J C Johnston jr &amp; herself to the Louisville Mechanical Bakery Company, and that a suit is now pending in the City of New york, to disolve the partnership<pb/>
<lb/>in said Bakery Co &amp; wind up its affairs and that until that suit is decided it will be impossible to say who is the owner of the property in question -- She would state further that steps have been taken by the representatives of the company here, to abate &amp; do away with the nuisance complained of.</p>
<p>In view of all the facts above stated believing that she has been unjustly fined she respectfully requests your Excellency to remit the fine, as she is informed, you have by law the right to do.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Mary E. Johnston.</p>
<p>His Excellency Gov Bramlette</p>
<p>I know Miss Mary E Johnston, who is the daughter of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> J C Johnston dec<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. and have inquired into the facts stated by her in this petition, and indorse them as true. It is clear to me she was improperly fined, and the Judge of the Court admitted it to me, but it was too late to arrest the Judgment <date when="1865-06-20">June 20 1865</date></p>
