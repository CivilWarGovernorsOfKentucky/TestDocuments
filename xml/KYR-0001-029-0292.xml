   <p>To the Hon. Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned Geo Huston, being called upon by Geo J Hales a citizen of Indiana makes at his request the following statement -- that in <date when="1860-11">November 1860</date> the undersigned was Judge of the Union County Court for Union County Kentucky that application was then made to him by affadavit and he issued his warrant for the arrest of William J Hales under charge of Malicious Stabbing of one Lash -- the prisoner was arrested and brought before me for examination under said charge and on the <date when="1860-11-07">7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> November 1860</date> I heard the case counsel being present for and against the prisoner. I found that reasonable cause existed for holding him over for trial in the circuit court not for felony but for stabbing in sudden heat &amp; passion without malice -- And required bail -- He executed a bail bond before me in the sum of two hundred dollars dated <date when="1860-11-07">7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> November 1860</date> with Peter Taylor<pb/>
<lb/>as his surity -- and the papers were returned to our circuit court -- I find an Indictment was found at <date when="1861-04">April 1861</date> by the Grand Jury for malicious stabbing -- and that the case was continued until <date when="1862-04">April 1862</date> the bond was declared forefeit for Hales failure to appear and summons awarded -- We have since had no court and no further proceedings have been had -- Hales was a young man say 18 or 20 who had married a short time before a Miss Lapham of this county by whom he received two slaves -- I understand that Hales &amp; wife joined in a mortgage on one or both<hi rend="str">er</hi> of the wifes slaves to Taylor to indemnify him as surity that Hales fled from this county since the inquiry before me and has since been absent, that his wife is and has been in this county since -- that Hales has no estate and his wife little or nothing but the slaves aforesaid -- I can find no memo of the testimony that was aduced before me -- my recollection is that Lash resided a short distance below the village of Raleigh on the Ohio river and<pb/>
<lb/>that Hales and some half dozen other young men of the village while on a drinking spree went down to Lash' premises, to induce him to remove an offensive family that he had on his premises -- some family that had been driven away from another neighborhood and that Lash had suffered to remove on to his grounds and got into some altercation with Lash and that Lash was perhaps drinking and was very insulting and provoking himself and perhaps attacked the parties and was stabbed by Hales with a pocket knife My impression is I should have acquitted the young man but from the fact of the unlawful expedition of Hales &amp; to his premises -- </p>
<p>If the bail is collected the effect will be the wife must pay its Begging to be excused for troubling you I am respectfully your obt svt</p>
<p>Geo Huston</p>
