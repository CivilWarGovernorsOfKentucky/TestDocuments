<p>At the request of the father of the convict for whom a petition is forwarded from this city to day I desire to say, that in common with the best citizens of this city I feel to sympathise with the convict, Geo. Knarr and his family, Knowing there are many circumstances in mitigation of the crime of<hi rend="str">or</hi> which he is convicted and Sir, should he be restored to his liberty, by the Exercise of Executive clemency, it will meet the approbation of the best and most responsible patron of this people who will cheerfully accord to you, motives actuated by the highest consideration of humanity</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
