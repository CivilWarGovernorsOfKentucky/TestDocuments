   <p>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin Governor of the state of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of the county of Fleming would respectfully represent that Samuel Howe was indicted by the grand Jury of Fleming county at its <date when="1860-07">July term 1860.</date> "for suffering gaming on his premises" and at the <date when="1860-03">late march term</date> of the Fleming circuit court Judgment was rendered against him for the sum of $200 -- fine, and ^also^ cost -- </p>
<p>Now we <hi rend="str">would</hi> think that there are strong reasons why your excellency should exercise the power vested in <hi rend="str">him</hi> You by the constitution, by pardoning &amp; remitting said fine. said Howe is a young gentleman of good moral character, and is not able to pay the amount -- he was not even present at the time of the gaming. which was done by a party of his young friends and intimate associates who were in the habit of visiting him -- </p>
