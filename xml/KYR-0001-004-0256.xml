<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thos E. Bramlette
<lb/>Resp<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Sir</p>
<p>It is with reluctance that I again Call your attention to the case of Geo Sidle. Herewith I send a certified copy of the bill of evidence in the case together with a copy of the opinion of the Court of Appeals. You will see that the appellate court admit that the instructions given at the instance of the Comwealth &amp; the refusal of the Court to give the instruction asked by the deft was <hi rend="underline">Erronious</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">highly prejudicial</hi> to <hi rend="underline">his</hi> case</p>
<p>But for a technical objection <hi rend="str">perhaps</hi> imperative on the Court they cannot reverse the judgement of the Circuit Court. Now here is a man condemned to an ignominious punishment by a Jury acting under Erronious instructions and by the oversight of his lawyers the Error cannot be rectified by the appellate Court. Is not this the very case where the Executive should interpose? A man is unjustly condemned and the tribunals of justice cannot afford him a remedy where can he apply except to you for relief? The Evidence is such that no jury would dare found a verdict of Manslaughter against Sidle if the law of the case had been properly expounded. He is an old man, very<pb/>
<lb/>humble in his circumstances and has always stood well in the community where he lived and if I did not believe that he had been convicted contrary to the ^Evidence &amp;^ law of the case I would not again trouble you to Examine it.</p>
<p>Your Respy
<lb/>W W Trimble</p>
<p>P S. This will be handed to you by Mr. Massena T Smith of Harrison Co who will wait for an answer</p>
<p>W. W. T.</p>
