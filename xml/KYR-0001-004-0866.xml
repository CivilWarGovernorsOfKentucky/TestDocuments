<p>Comth agst August Worms obtaining money on false representations from Autun Shneiderbahn: This day a week ago accused came to my house in this city &amp; offered to sell me a breast pin &amp; pair Earings &amp; said his father sent them to him from Paris &amp; that they cost Eight Dollars. that they are good gold &amp; worth five Dollars to him. He said he has a sister in St. Paul &amp; wanted to go to see her and had no money. I offered him three Dollars for the jewelry &amp; he took it, &amp; I paid him &amp; took the jewelry which is the same in Court. I soon found, that I had been cheated. From representations of accused that the articles were made of good gold &amp; his wish to see his sister, I was induced to buy.</p>
<p>Geo. Wolfe, I am a jeweller. The two breastpins &amp; two pair Earings in Court are brass and are worth about 50<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi> a set- there is no gold about them. If either set were pure gold, they would be worth $25 or $20.-</p>
