<lb/>Hon. John Sherman
<lb/>Washington D. C.
<lb/>Dear Brother:</p>
<p>I enclose you a letter just received from Col. W. J. Landram of the 19<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> Ky. He was one of the first Kentuckians who came forward to volunteer his services, and I know he has commanded a Brigade for a long time. He commanded one at Chickasaw last winter and also at Vicksburg, and why he has not been promoted I cannot imagine.</p>
<p>A great many Brigadiers are laying about loose without commands and Colonels are doing their duty</p>
<p>I think it right that all Brigadiers who by going on furlough lost their commands should stay out unless their absence results from wounds or sickness<pb/>
<lb/>incurred in service. I wish you would befriend Col. Landram in every way possible</p>
<p>Affectionately
<lb/>{signed} W. T. Sherman
<lb/>(A copy)</p>
