<lb/>Gov. Thos. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Although almost unknown to you, permit me to make a suggestion in regard to the condition of this section of the state just now. The 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> Ky Cavalry a very efficient ^Regt,^ which since March has been stationed at Hopkinsville and afforded protection to this section, has lately been ordered to report at Nashville for duty in part The 48<hi rend="sup">th</hi> infantry has gone to Russellville and this section lying below Russellville and South of Henderson County, is left entirely exposed to Guerrillas &amp; robbers, who have already ruined the state West of Tennessee River. We will assuredly be plundered &amp; ravaged <hi rend="str">if</hi> ^or^ not murdered, if not protected promptly.</p>
<p>Our only hope now is in home Guards. There are some 15 or 20 young and efficient <hi rend="str">young</hi> men in this and Trigg who have been in service in the 3<hi rend="sup">rd</hi> Ky Cav. this Fall but discharged as we understand however the mustering officer would not service them. There are also a few of the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Cav. who were discharged at the expiration of their term, who lately routed Bob Martin on his return from a raid into Ky. </p>
<p>This form can be immediately counted and made efficient by giving commpanies to <unclear>each</unclear> of the most efficient men among them.</p>
<p>We therefor ask you to appoint Thos. Henderson Captain of a company of Home Guards If you do so in an <unclear/> that a protection will ever be afforded by prompt action<pb/>
<lb/>is necessary. permit us to say that we have <unclear>seen</unclear> nothing <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> since the Rebellion that meets our views so completely as your messages</p>
<p>Respcectfully
