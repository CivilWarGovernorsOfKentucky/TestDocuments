<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Gov State of kentucky
<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir</p>
<p>At the <date when="1863-12">December (1863) term</date> of the Hickman Co Court, I, as Judge of Said Court, Granted to Jno Titsworth, tavern license to keep a tavern in the town of Clinton, and included in Said license, permission to keep a bar in a room, across the street and detached from the tavern building. For keeping Said <hi rend="underline">tippling</hi> House, he was indicted and fined, at the late <date when="--02">February term</date> of the Hickman Circuit Court, in the Sum of Sixty Dollars.</p>
<p>The reason why I gave Said license and also permission to keep Said bar in manner as above Stated, is, that Judge R. K. Williams, formerly Circuit Judge of this district, had decided that the law gives to County Judges that power.</p>
<p>I think it hard that Mr Titsworth Should have to pay the fine, as, if he was guilty of any offense against the law, it was through ignorance and under the impression that he had satisfied the laws and that impression made by the nature of his license. Now if you care, with consistence<pb/>
<lb/>in your official duties, remit Said fine, I think it will be nothing more than Justice to Mr Titsworth</p>
<p>Most respectfully
<lb/>Your obt Servant
<lb/>Willis White
<lb/>Judge Hickman Co. Court<pb/></p>

<lb/>vs
