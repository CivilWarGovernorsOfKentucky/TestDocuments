   <p><stamp/>To His Excellency B. Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky.</p>
<p>The undersigned were jurors upon the Trial of Rufus Jones at the late term of the Warren Ecquity &amp; Criminal Court and found him guilty of ^the^ Manslaughter of Henry Jenkins &amp; fixed his imprisonment at four years. We did not believe the killing was done with malice, but under sudden heat &amp; passion &amp; hence our verdict -- Yet, altogether we thought under the law we were compelled to find this verdict, the youth of Jury, the connection between the two families, the intimacy &amp; kindness between the Jury &amp; the deceased, and the total absence of anything like a malicious heart induce us to ask that your Excellency will interpose as the Constitution empowers you &amp; relieve him from the punishment which he must otherwise suffer -- </p>
<p>Most Respectfully
