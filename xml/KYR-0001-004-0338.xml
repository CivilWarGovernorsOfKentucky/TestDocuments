   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E Bramilette Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky,</p>
<p>We whose names are hereunto Subscribed represent to your Excellency, that at the <date when="1863-12">December term 1863</date> of the Barren Equity &amp; Criminal Court, James Bryan Esq of this county was found guilty by a Jury under an Indictment found by the grand Jury of this County against him of permitting his negro woman Slave Amelia to go at large, and hire herself out, the fine therefor under the statutes of Kentucky being $40.</p>
<p>The Said Bryan is a Batchelor, and is not keeping House, his Said negro woman lived in a House with another family Some 30 Steps from the boarding House of her owner and is an exceedingly good, Orderly, and Obedient Old woman, her owner James<pb/>
<lb/>Bryan is a man distinguished for his honesty and piety far and near.</p>
<p>Upon the trial of Said indictment no instance of actual hiring of the Old woman made by her Own Contract was proven; but the evidence was exclusively of a circumstancial character.</p>
<p>No person has been injured, no nuisance has been created, and no family annoyed or interrupted by Said slave; she was purchased by her Owner as an act of charity to her husband, a good and honest Old negro man to prevent a Separation of man &amp; wife.</p>
<p>We are Satisfied that if the letter of the law has been violated by said Bryan, that its Spirit and reason has not been infringed.</p>
<p>There are a number of circumstances connected with<pb/>
<lb/>the case which we have not space here to enumerate; all indicating it, as a case that readily deserves the exercise of Executive Clemency in the remission of the fine imposed.</p>
<p>We therefore respectfully recommend, to your excellency the propriety of remitting Said fine against said James Bryan, who is a good citizen, a loyal man &amp; useful member of Society.
