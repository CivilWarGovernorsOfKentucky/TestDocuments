<lb/>To his excellency Beriah Magoffin 
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky </p>
<p>The undersigned would respectfully represent to your excellecy that Joseph Roach, who was accused of a breach of the peace in Shelby, and twice tried before a jury, in the former of which trials the jury hung -- but in the latter he was fined $30 and fifteen days imprisonment, <hi rend="str">that he</hi> was tried with not having all the witnesses necessary to a fair trial, that undue prejudice operated upon the minds of the jury, that he is a poor man, and his labor necessary to the support of his mother, that under the circumstances the case demands Executive clemency -- and we would recommend to your Excellency and verily believe that mercy may be properly ministered, and ask your Excellecy to remit, the fine and punishment, and such other full relief as your<pb/>
<lb/>Excellency may deem meet and wise -- </p>
<p>M L Harlett
<lb/>G. Chrisman </p>
<p>From my knowledge of this affair ^which is limited^ I am willing to ask your Excellency to remit the imprisonment &amp; half the fine.</p>

<p>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin Governor of Kentucky I was presant at the trial and defended Joseph Roach and all the evidence before the jury was the person who had gotton the warrant upon oath and the court decided him incompitant to testify and afterwards by giving security for costs was permitted to testify that the witness is of Bad Reputation <hi rend="str">I</hi> and I think in justice you ought to exercise your clemency in this case</p>
