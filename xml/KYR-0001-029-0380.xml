   <p>His Excellency
<lb/>The Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned petitioner would most respectfully State, that at the present term of the Jefferson Circuit Court he was tried upon an indictment in Said Court charging him with the Commission of a Robbery upon one M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> Elizabeth Newton, in Connexion with one Elisha Applegate, -- Now your petitioner would State (and the proof in the case shows it) that Applegate is an Entire Stranger to petitioner, form the proof there is no doubt but that Applegate did rob the house of M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> Newton, and there is no doubt but that at the time Applegate Committed the offense that Some other person was seen near the house when the offense was Committed, the proof showed that that other person was not nearer the house than 34 yards, the offense was committed in the dead hour of the night and the only proof that connected me with the crime was that of a young Lady a Granddaughter of M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> Newtons who said she looked out of the door &amp; Saw me standing near the yard gate and recognized me, and that was the only proof against me, now your petitioner would most solemly avow in the presence of that <hi rend="underline">God</hi> to whom he has to account in another world for all the deeds done in this life, that he knew nothing of the matter, and had nothing to do with or any Knowledge of the matter whatever, and that the young lady is <hi rend="underline">Mistaken</hi> in my identity.<pb/>
<lb/>I have lived in Jefferson County Ky many years and during the whole time I have honestly tried to make a living for myself and family by hard labour, I have a wife &amp; children, and I assure your Excellency that death would have been far preferable to me than that Such a charge should have been made against me, but all I can now hope is that your Excellency will Extend to me that mercy which I know I am Entitled to, that you will remit the finding of the Jury in my case and let me show the public by my acts that I am still an honest man, and as in duty bound I will Ever pray &amp;c</p>

<lb/>Most Respectfully
<lb/>Joseph Shenneberger</p>
<p>We the undersigned petitioners are acquainted with the above petitioner Joseph Shenneberger Know him to be a man of truth, believe his statements are true and cheerfully unite with him in asking your Excellency to grant him a pardon, believing as good citizens that Justice demands the Same</p>

<p>The undersigned members of the jury who tried Joseph Shoenberger respectfully but earnestly recommend him to executive clemency and pray that his sentence may be remitted by the Governor -- His previous character was excellent. The testimony was conflicting, and depended upon the recognition of the prisoner in the night time by a young girl ^of seventeen years old.^ at a distance of thirty five steps -- she being in <hi rend="str">the</hi>door way house and the prisoner out of doors <hi rend="str">which</hi> ^<hi rend="str">cause</hi>^ <hi rend="str"><unclear/> </hi>of <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> <hi rend="str">to doubt whether the recognition was complete</hi> </p>
