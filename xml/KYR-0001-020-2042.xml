   <p>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioners would state that some two years since one William Summer was arrested in Eddyville Kentucky on a warrant that issued from the office of Henry Mayer a justice of the Peace of Lyon County on charge of obtaining money under false pretenses. And Thos P Paine and Archibald Hunter signed (as his sureties) a bail Bond for his appearance before the aforesaid Justice for the trial of said charge on a day fixed by said Justice. That said Summer was a foreigner and unacquainted with our system of Laws and on account of some interference by persons who desired to see said Paine and Hunter suffer on account of said Summer induced him to leave and not appear at the time &amp; place fixed for trial. &amp; thereupon said bond was taken forfeited and proceedings had then on in the Lyon Circuit Court and at the <date when="1862-06">June Term 1862</date> of said Court Judgement was rendered vs Paine and Hunter for the Sums of One Hundred Dollars, Now if said cause however been investigated (That as the charge vs Summer) we would not venture an opinion upon the merits thereof, but since no such investigation was had we feel free to say that the charge vs Summer was wholly groundless and without foundation, and from all<pb/>
<lb/>the facts &amp; circumstances convicted there with we think that said case (Judgement vs Paine &amp; Hunter) <hi rend="str">deserves th</hi>e merits the interference of <hi rend="str">the</hi> Executive clemency, all off which is respectfully submitted</p>
