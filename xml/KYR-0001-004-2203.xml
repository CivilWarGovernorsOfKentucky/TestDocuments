   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E Bramlette
<lb/>Govenor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner Jno W Harris states that several years ago, he was in the city of Lexington and from some cause, for which he <hi rend="underline">can not now account</hi>, got into a condition, as he is told and believes, of intoxication to an extent that rendered him utterly incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong and whilst in this condition he became engaged in a difficulty with one James Harkins, and inflicted upon him wounds with a Knife. For this offence he was indicted in the Fayette Circuit Court, and at the <date when="1865-08">August term thereof 1865</date>. upon trial fined $250.<hi rend="sup">x</hi></p>
<p>He states that he has no doubt he committed the act but he has no recollection of it. That he is not in the habit of intoxication: That he for a support for himself and family depends and is compelled to depend on his daily exertions, and to pay said fine would sorely distress him and his family.</p>
<p>He would therefore ask your excellency to remit the fine so far as you can, and by so doing confer on one of your citizens as a lasting obligation</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">John, W, Harris</hi></p>
