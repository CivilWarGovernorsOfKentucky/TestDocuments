<lb/>STANTON &amp; THROOP,
<lb/>ATTORNEYS AT LAW,
<lb/>Maysville, Ky, <date when="1861-09-20">Sep 20 1861</date></p>
<p>My dear Governor,</p>
<p>Sometime ago, young Mr Alexander H Cummins of this place, was indicted in the Woodford Circuit Court for larceny, and held to bail in the sum of $500, with Andrew M. January, Isaac Whittington and M<hi rend="sup">m</hi> W. Whittington as his surities. At the <date when="1861-04">April</date> Term of said Court, the bail bond was forfeited. As I have heard the circumstances, it is probable that no larceny was committed or intended to be committed, the boy having been intoxicated at the time, the affair occuring in the middle of the day at a public hotel, and the valise, which is said to have been stolen, only thrown into the street without being carried off or any attempt to do so, If judgment goes against the sureties, it will have to be paid by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> H. Cummins of this place, a worthy and respectble gentleman<pb/>
<lb/>with a large family and small means. If he has it to pay, it will sweep every thing he has. I therefore respectfully ask that you will remit the forfeiture of the bond, and thus confer a great favor upon M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cummins,</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Your friend
<lb/>R H Stanton</p>
<p>Hon B. Magoffin,</p>
