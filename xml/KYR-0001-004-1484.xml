   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E Bramlette
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your petitioner begs leave respectfully to state that he is a citizen &amp; resident of Allen County Kentucky, where he was born and raised -- under the excitement of the times in the autumn of <date when="1861">1861</date> he joined the Confederate Army at Bowling Green, enlisting for one year in the Regiment then commanded by Joseph H Lewis of Barren, being the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky -- After my time expired I was anxious to return home and to live as a quiet, orderly and good citizen of the Commonwealth, and made more than one effort to do so, but was told by citizens that I would not be permitted to remain at home, but would be exchanged or sent to prison. I was unfortunately alone when a party of soldiers under the command of a Lieutenant commissioned as such in the regular service of the Confederate army, sent out by Gen<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. Wheeler as scouts with a detail from several regiments entered Scottsville in <date when="1863-07">July 1863.</date> His object in going to Scottsville was to capture the Federal forces there &amp; any public property which might be there situated I was not with the party when the firing took place at the Hospital &amp; had no agency in that matter, nor did I participate in taking any property, but on the contrary discountenanced and discouraged the whole thing. One Federal soldier was killed, as I learned, at the Hospital by the name of Siper as I was informed. For this killing of a Federal soldier done<pb/>
<lb/>not by me but by the soldiers under command of said Lieutenant, I have been indicted in the Allen Circuit Court for murder. Two indictments were also found against me for Robbery founded upon the taking of the property above named &amp; in which I did not participate, or sympathize. I was, for some tim confined at Bowling Green in the military prison &amp; was finally turned over to the civil authorities to answer said indictments. I was allowed by the <hi rend="str">Circuit</hi> ^County^ Judge of Allen to give bail in all the Cases -- have done so and since <date when="1864-04">April 1864</date> have been at liberty. I feel conscious that I am not guilty of the Charges in either indictment &amp; that I ought not to be punished therefor. I have made no attempt to escape &amp; do not intend to but will meet the Cases whenever tried. Since my release on Bail I have lived as a quiet peacable &amp; orderly citizen, obeying the laws of my state in every respect -- I expect so to continue.</p>
<p>I herewith send a copy of the evidence given on my application for Bail taken down by Cap<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. G M Mulligan of Allen -- I trust your excellency wil see grounds to grant me a pardon of said offenes charged against me, and I assure you there shall be no cause for you or others to afterwards think your confidence or leniency has been misplaced</p>
<p>Most Respectfully</p>
<p>Frank Porter</p>
<p>This day Frank Porter personally appeared before me and made oath that the statements made<pb/>
<lb/>by him in the foregoing petition are true, witness my had this <date when="1865-02-07">7 day of Feby 1865</date></p>
