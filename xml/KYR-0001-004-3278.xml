   <p>To his Excellency Gov. Bramlette</p>
<p>On the <gap/> day of <gap/> <date when="1863">1863</date> W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Johnson and L. Williams were accused of stealing one shirt, one pair of socks, two vests, and one cravat, all old and valued by the owner at six dollars. An examination was had and the parties held over to answer an indictment of "Grand larceny", at the <date when="--06">next June term</date> of the Franklin Circuit Court. Being unable to give bail they were confined in the county jail 'till trial. A seperate arraignment and trial was asked and granted. L Williams was convicted of "grand larceny", and sent to the state prison for one year; but in the case of W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Johnson the jury <hi rend="str">could not find a verdict and</hi> ^brought in a verdict of guilty, contrary to the instructions of the court. wherefore the court set aside the verdict, and granted a new trial. The Jury^ were therefore discharged and prisoner remanded to jail.</p>
<p>At the regular fall term following, of the same court, a trial was <hi rend="underline">asked</hi> but <hi rend="underline">not</hi> g<hi rend="underline">ranted</hi> on account of other pressing matter.</p>
<p>The prisoner has been languishing in jail for eight months, with but slight prospect of that "speedy trial", guaranteed to him by the Constitution of his state: Now, therefore, we, your petitioners, believing that the prisoner <hi rend="underline">has</hi> <hi rend="underline">been</hi> <hi rend="underline">sufficiently</hi> <hi rend="underline">punished</hi> for the offence <hi rend="underline">charged</hi>, do pray you to<pb/>
<lb/>extend to him that Mercy which the Law in its clemency has empowered you as Governor to exercise.</p>
<p>We believe that such an act, on your part in this case, will make the prisoner a good citizen, and result beneficially to the Commonwealth</p>
