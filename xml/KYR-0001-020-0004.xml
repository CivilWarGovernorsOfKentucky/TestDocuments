<lb/>Gov. B. Magoffin -- </p>
<p>My dear Sir -- I have had frequent occasion to trouble you with petitions asking the interposition of executive clemency on behalf of my friends but in all instances I have endeavored to be governed by reasons which would justify the exercise of this noblest attribute of sovereignty; &amp; it is not a little gratifying to know that in every instance I have found a ear open to the complaints &amp; a heart keenly sensitive to the frailties of our common humanity.</p>
<p>I write you now, Governor, on behalf of Thomas B. Wadlington of Caldwell county, who has been ^found^ guilty of murder &amp; sentenced to be hanged, on the first Friday in March next. Not knowing perhaps as well as your excellency does, the facts in the case; yet I venture to appeal to that generosity of a noble nature, which I know would gladly leave the dire act of taking mortal life in the hands of Him who hath said "Vengeance is mine;" &amp; if it shall seem to your excellency that the ends of justice may be met &amp; the <hi rend="str">offen</hi> accused go free I know that the hearts of innocent women &amp; children will leap with gratitude, &amp; their benedictions will ever ascend for him who shall thus show himself a deliverer in the hour of adversity &amp; trial.</p>
<p>I know many of the relatives &amp; friends of the unfortunate man Wadlington &amp; I know them to be among our best citizens. I know their anxiety upon the subject; &amp; it is mainly on their behalf ^that I now write you^ Nevertheless, I have been in Caldwell county during the progress of Wadlington's trial &amp; since its termination, &amp; from what I could gather<pb/>
<lb/>of public sentiment there, I feel warranted in saying there is nothing in it which evinces a thirst for blood of the prisoner. On the contrary, I believe there is much indication of a different tone of feeling.</p>
<p>That county, for that last year or two has suffered intense excitement, resulting from the lawless acts of men who could not be reached by the courts of the country, &amp; the law of self preservation prompted the citizens to organise companies of "regulators" to rid themselves of troublesome persons It was right upon the heels of this excitement that the sad event occurred which led to the conviction of Wadlington; &amp; I have but little doubt, if his trial could have been had under a calmer state of public feeling the issue would have been very different. Hoping that upon an impartial examination of the facts in this case your exellency may find reasons for the exercise of mercy,</p>
<p>I subscribe myself
<lb/>Yours respectfully
<lb/>George C. Bronaugh</p>
