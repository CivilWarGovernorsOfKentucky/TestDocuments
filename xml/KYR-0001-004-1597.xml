<lb/>To His Excellency
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E. Bramlette</p>
<p>At the <date when="1864-12">December Term 1864</date> of the Henderson Circuit Court Judgment was rendered against D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> L. F Jones and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> James Beatty ^for $50.^ on a forfeited recognizance. as the sureties of Henry Rains, who was indicted for selling liquor to a slave. The facts of the case are that Rains had a wife and sevral young Children who were in a destitute condition, and these gentlemen went his security to get him out of jail to prevent his family from starving and freezing, and it was entirely an act of humanity with them. They were his sureties in two other similar cases at the same time, upon which judgment have been rendered and they have settled the matter up, and in as much as he and his family have long since left the Commonwealth. they ask that you will remit this fine and they will promptly settle up the costs. There is an execution now in the hands of the sheriff against them, and they will be compelled to pay the whole of it, unless relieved by your Excellency. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Barret the Commonwealths atty<pb/>
<lb/>has promised to sign a petition for them, but he is at present absent at court on the District and will not be at home for several weeks. There are <hi rend="str">no</hi> no more highly respectable gentlemen in this County or the state than these two gentlemen, and I hope you will remit this fine, because I believe it would be right for you to do so.</p>
<p>Very Truly Your obt srvt.
