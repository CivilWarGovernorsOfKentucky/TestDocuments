<p>Your petitioner states that he now resides in Barren County and has resided there for the last 24 years, and his residence is at least 17 miles from Scottville the county site of Allen County, That he was together with his brother in law Several years ago the Administrater of Alfred Settle another Brother in law, That previous to the year <date when="1863">1863.</date> a suit was brought against himself and the other administrater of said Settle in the Allen circuit Court to settle said estate, But he charges most positively that he was never summoned in said suit, and the first he ever heard of it was in <date when="1863-06">June 1863</date> or near that time, when he was attached to Show cause why he did not answer said petition, and to show cause also why he should not be fined for a contempt of Court,</p>
<p>At the next term of said Court he attended for the purpose of answering said attachment but no Court was held, he remaining there until at least wennesday of said term to see if any Court would be held, and none was held during said term, but at which term he employed Council At the next term, his daughter about 17 years old residing with him was very seriously ill so much that he could not thinking of leaving home and rideing a distance from her of 17 miles<pb/>
<lb/>while he would have had to travel had he went to said Court, this severe sickness of his daughter was during the first days of said Court as well as he now recollects near all the first week of said term, which Court could have ^held^ two weeks, but so soon and during said term as he believed it safe to leave his daughter be immediately went to Scottville to attend to said attachment, but when arrived there Court had adjourned, and he then learned that Court had been held but a few days of said term, indeed at that time, but little was done in Court in this part of the state owing to the danger resulting from the <hi rend="str">absen</hi> presents of soldiers and gurillas in the country, At the next term of said Court he attended, and by his attorey responded by answer to said attachment, his attory telling him all would now be right, haveing at the same time pled his answer to the original suit. Your petitioner confideing in the advice of his attony, he supposed he had done all that was necessary to be done, leaving the management of his business to said attony, supposing he would have<hi rend="str">ing</hi> nothing more to do unless the plaintiffs desired to take depositions, and haveing received no notice of such intention he rested satisfied that he would be troubled<pb/>
<lb/>no more about said attachment, and did not <hi rend="str">attended</hi> put himself to any more trouble about it. but still at the present term of <hi rend="str">the</hi> said Court towit <date when="1865-03">March term 1865,</date> he attended on the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. day thereof, expecting only to attend to the original suit, but on the next day after his arrival at said Court, he was informed by his attory that judgment upon said attachment had been rendered against him as a fine for $150.00, your petitioner was very much surprised and immediately came to Glasgow to see a Lawyer who had generally attended to his business, who drew up for him an affidavit seting out substantially the same facts as herein set out and directed him to go forthwith and present said affidavit, <hi rend="str">wh</hi> to the judge of said Court with a view to procure a new trial of said attachment, he immediately started to said Court, and upon geting within a few miles he was informed the Court had adjourned he however went on to Scottville, and found his information true, said judgment was rendered jointly against himself and J. S. Jordan his security in his bond for his appearance.</p>
<p>Your petitioner states that he is a poor man and it will be hard for him to have<pb/>
<lb/>to pay said judgment, it never was his intention to disregard any Summons of law, or to offer any contempt of Court. he has always been a law abiding man.</p>
