   <p>Morganfield Ky. <date when="1865-03-24">Mar, 24 -- 65</date>
<lb/>Gov Bramlette</p>
<p>Dr Sir I enclose you the letter of Mr Barrett atty for Com'th this District recommending the remission of the forfeited bond of E M Springfield N M Couch and Jesse Marks as bail in sum of $150 for appearance of Sam'l Brown to answer indictment vs him in Webster Circuit Court= The bond was forfeited while Mr Lowe was commonwealth's atty, I personally know they paid Mr Lowe, I know his hand writing and have seen his receipts for the money; when they were served with process on the forfeited bond they applied to me as their atty to answer summons in the plea of payment. I advised them the plea was not good, that they erred in paying Mr Lowe and not the trustee of the Jury funds -- </p>
<p>If yr opinion accord with Mr Barrett's please send me at this place the remission They could send a petition signed by all their neighbors, but I advised them a letter from Mr Barrett would be<pb/>
<lb/>more reliable= If any reference be made in behalf of my statement Gen Combs, Mr R R Bolling, Messrs Harlan &amp; Harlan, A. W. Dudley Col Rennick or any of the old citizens of Frankfort are my acquaintances -- </p>
<p>Respectfully
