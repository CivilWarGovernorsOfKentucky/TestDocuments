<lb/>Gov. Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Captain Samuel G. Rogers was Indicted in the Bracken Circuit Court for <hi rend="underline">acting</hi> as one of Col Leonidas Metcalfe's second, in a Duell between him &amp; Casto in <date when="1861">1861</date>. He appeared at the present term of the court &amp; was ready for trial &amp; fully prepared to claim his innocence of the charge, but the Commonwealth was not ready &amp; obtained a <hi rend="underline">continuance</hi> Col Metcalfe was of course a material witness to prove he did <hi rend="underline">not</hi> <hi rend="underline">act</hi> as his second, but simply was present upon the occasion as <hi rend="underline">his</hi> <hi rend="underline">friend</hi> - Col Metcalfe could not attend our court again without a great sacrifice &amp; to prevent that &amp; <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> ^His^ own further attendance in the Court Capt Rogers was induced to plead guilty &amp; allow a<pb/>
<lb/>fine $150- to be assessed against him. We are satisfied Capt Rogers did <hi rend="underline">not act as the second</hi> of Col Metcalfe in that Duell, but was present only in the character of a friend. <hi rend="str">Lt</hi> C<hi rend="sup">ol</hi> Metcalfe received the challenge in the city of Maysville without a moments warning. Capt Rogers was in Lexington at the time &amp; did not hear of the challenge until after the preliminaries were settled &amp; the correspondence terminated. C<hi rend="sup">ol</hi> Metcalfe stated these facts to us as true &amp; will accompany this with a communication to that Effort. If their ever was a Duell justifiable we believe this to be one. You are of course already familiar with the facts connected with the affair, That is the Duell &amp; doubtless will concur with us in that conclusion. We believe Captain Rogers innocent of the charge<pb/>
<lb/>&amp; actuated alone by the considerations in putting in said plea stated above &amp; therefore take pleasure in requesting you to remit his fine &amp; restore him to all his rights as a citizen.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully

<p>Under the peculiar circumstances in this case I join in the recommendation for remission &amp; pardon. Judge Doniphon was called home last night by the dangerous illness of his father -- if here I think he would concur</p>
