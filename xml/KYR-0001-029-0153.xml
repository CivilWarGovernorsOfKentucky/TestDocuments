<lb/>Hon: James F Robertson</p>
<p>Dear Sir -- I am a close neighbor and acquaintance of your Petitioner James M Doty -- I have read his petition to your Excellency and know the statements therein ^made^ are true -- During the origin and progress of this revolution -- I have been an anxious observer of men and things in the neighbourhood in which I live -- And it affords me pleasure to State, that whilst your Petitioner was recognized as belonging to the revolutionary party he was never active, save in smoothing its asperation, and in his Efforts to secure the personal and pecuniary safety, of the loyal men of his neighbourhood -- In the absence of any protection from the government the loyal men around him, had nothing to shield them from violence -- during that terrible and ever memorable reign of terror -- but the considerable kindness and interposition of your Petitioner -- This was exercised by him to such an Extent, as to cause him to be suspected by his party -- And I doubt not, that he was compelled the risk of taking office at their hands, to Secure his own Safety -- Now let me assure your Excellency, that the Exercise of your Clemency in granting a full pardon, to your Petitioner in the premises will be as gratefully and as kindly acknowledged by the loyal men of his neighbourhood as by himself and family.</p>
<p>Your obedient Servant <hi rend="underline">W G Rodes</hi>
<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>J F Robertson Governor of Ky<pb/></p>
<p>J. M. Doty of Barren pettn to pardon for offenses of usurpation of Office</p>
<p>The matt. in this case has not been tried. It is a very dangerous exercise of my power to arrest the trial of offences if such power exists I do not think any good reason appears to exercise it in this case now</p>
<p>J F R -- </p>
