<lb/>Gov. T. E. Bramlette
<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, Sir,</p>
<p>At the last Term of the Barren Circuit court an indictment was found against Mr E. K. Owsley for hog-stealing. I have no hesitancy in stating that I believe said charge to be false unfounded and malicious. I have known Mr Owsley ever since he came to Mam, Cave in <date when="1861">1861,</date> and know him to be a man of strict honor and integrity. When he became Proprietor of of the Hotel at this place he purchased of the former proprietor and some other parties a lot of hogs that were running out in common with other hogs belonging to divers persons, and I am satisfied that if hogs were killed by Mr Owsley<hi rend="sup">s</hi> employees ^that did not belong to him^ it was done without his knowledge or consent. I understand that the three principal witness in the case were Thos. H. Waters Robt. Shaw &amp; Philip Wilder. The two former I have known long and well, and to say the least they are men of very doubtful veracity and so regarded in this community. The latter I know but little about except that there was at the time of the finding of the indictment a very bad state of feeling existing between him and Mr Owsley growing out of the fact that Mr Owsley had<pb/>
<lb/>some time previously discharged ^him^ from his employ.</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Your Obt Svt.
<lb/>C. Roberts</p>
<p>I know judge C. Roberts to be a gentleman, of high inteligence and undoubted veracity</p>
