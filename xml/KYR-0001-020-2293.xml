   <p>Govenor Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I was present &amp; heard all of the evidence on the trial of S D King for the killing of Luckey at the present term of the Madison circuit court &amp; it is correctly set forth in the petition of the jury &amp; of others that will be sent here with to you, King done as any honourable man ought to have done Indeed he did not go as far as he would have been justified in doing as I am satisfied he only intended to chastise &amp; not to kill Luckey The sentiment is unanimous among those disinterested that King should not be punished. I was not engaged in his prosecution in defence &amp; hope you will promptly pardon him</p>
<p>Yours truly
<lb/>Thos. Turner</p>
