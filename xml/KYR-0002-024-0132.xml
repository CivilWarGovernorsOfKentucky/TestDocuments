<lb/>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Sir</p>
<p>Your very kind letter of <date when="1862-10-31">31<hi rend="sup">st</hi> Oct</date> was read yesterday evening We are under great obligations for your prompt efforts for supplying our men. They manifested great pleasure when I announced what you had done &amp; were doing &amp;c</p>
<p>Our need of guns is more pressing than most cases. not only on account of our having different calibres. which is a very serious objection. but because the musket we have is exceedingly defective.</p>
<p>I drew a pen through the suggestions I made to Gov Robinson about changing the location of our<pb/>
<lb/>Regiment on account of the earnest wish of many -- </p>
<p>If the Gov &amp; yourself approve it I would be glad you would postpone at least any efforts to get us transferred to a different field -- I am pleased to find so far a great disposition amongst the men, not to be troublesome &amp; restless on account of being near their houses. and the great satisfaction they have in meeting their families (very many of our regiment being married men) whom they have not seen for many months -- makes me willing not to desire yet a disign of location as long as they can be managed as soldiers should be here -- I have commenced by punishing promptly the first disobedience of orders. &amp; have given the men besides to underst-<pb/>
<lb/>and that I would use my efforts to have them removed from <hi rend="str">their</hi>ther neighborhood of their faimlies if they were too troublesome here -- &amp; I am more encouraged in the troops that we can get along -- If their present disposition does not continue I will most certainly <unclear/> <unclear/> earnestly the request <hi rend="str">to ask</hi>for a change -- </p>
<p>But I will be satisfied with your action of course if you think but to take such steps now -- </p>
<p>Should a change of field of operation be necessary -- towards the <unclear/> would be the direction that would ^be^ most conducive to the end desired</p>
<p>Most all our officers wish to try to manage their men here -- </p>
<p>Very Respectfully &amp;c
