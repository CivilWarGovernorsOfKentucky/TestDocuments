   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Thos E. Bramlete

<p>Your Petitioner W. N. Mayfield would respectfully state, that he was fined two hundred dollars in the City Court of Louisville at the <date when="--02">February term</date> of said court for permitting gambling in his house.</p>
<p>Your petitioner makes no denial that on several occasions he did permit playing, but the games were for small amounts, &amp; among friends, &amp; fore amusement, <hi rend="str">&amp; not for gain.</hi> more than gains &amp; usualy the same parties. The playing was not permitted because of its profits, but simply as above stated. The two hundred dollars fine is the lowest fixed by statute. Your petitioner prays your Excellency to remit the amount as none of the prayers were gamblers, but good citizens &amp; business men, &amp; only met to while away a little time, when business hours had passed</p>
<p>Your Excellency is respectfully refered to the signers of this petition</p>
