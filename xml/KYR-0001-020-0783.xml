   <p>Hopkinsville Ky <date when="1861-04-10">April 10 1861</date>
<lb/>To his Excellency the Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of Ky
<lb/>My Dear Sir</p>
<p>I am urged by the friends of <hi rend="str">Solomon</hi> ^Johnathan^ Greer to write to you to ask a pardon for him from the sentence of our last circuit court.</p>
<p>He is sentenced to the penitentiary for 5 years for Manslaughter</p>
<p>You will receive many other petitions fully detailing the case, I'll not give them, suffice it to say, the whole of the dificulty arose from the slander of Greers daughter, her Brothers assaulted the slanderer, and in the fight Greer did the killing, for which he is sentenced He is 65 years old, has allways been a <hi rend="underline">remarkably</hi> peacible quiet old man and the crime was done with strong cause. The idea of sending old Greer to the penitentiary to <hi rend="underline">reform him</hi> is preposterous, I never knew a more general wish than that he should be pardoned. I was foreman of the Grand jury that found the indictment, and know it was found with great reluctance Your excellency may rest assured<pb/>
<lb/>that an exhibition of your clemency in this case will be universally approved</p>
<p>With high respect
<lb/>yr obt servant
<lb/>S M Starling</p>
<p>His Excellency
<lb/>Beriah M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Goffin
<lb/>Goven<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of Ky</p>
