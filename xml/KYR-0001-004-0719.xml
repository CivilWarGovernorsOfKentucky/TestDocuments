<lb/>Governor,</p>
<p>Enclosed find petition of those boys of whom I spoke to you some time ago, who were indicted in the Casey Circuit Court, I have also enclosed my own affidavit as to the agreement, Owsley persisits in saying he does not recollect it.</p>
<p><note place="left margin">If you can have the amount of the bond in blank so that I may fill up correctly after writing to the clerk. It is probably that the petition is incorrect in amounts. ELV.</note></p>
<p>He insists that you ought not to deprive <hi rend="str">you</hi> him of his part of the forfeiture I insist that it would be outrageous for him to take it &amp; urge you if you think I am right to have remission forwarded to me at once at<pb/>
<lb/>this place (Somerset) The boys pray pardon of the crime also. They were guilty as I know from the proof before the Grand jury which I heard, but were all drunk in a devilish frolick on their way home from the Bear Wallow.</p>
<p>They belong to <hi rend="underline">good</hi> families, were always honest, and well behaved- up to that time and are now as good soldiers as Wolford has in his Regiment, faithful, and true.</p>
<p>You have the facts &amp; can do as you deem just &amp; right in the premises &amp;c</p>
<p>I would be glad to hear from you How about your Inp East?</p>
<p>Yours Truly
<lb/>E L Van Winkle</p>
<p>Have got another big case in ct of appeals from here.</p>
