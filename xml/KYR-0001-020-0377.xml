<lb/>the evening of the same day meeting with Reed in the town of Harrodsburg upon some words passing, Reed attempted as he then believd and now believes to draw a knife or pistol from his Coat, that thus seeing &amp; believing he drew his pistol to defend himself, he did not shoot Reed or fire the pistol and did not strike said Reed for this he was fined Twenty five dollars -- He says that he did not do Reed any damage in either case, the he was only acting as he believed he had a right and as it was his duty to defend or protect his infant. child and to keep him from being treated wrongfully in the future -- He admits he was excited at the conduct of Reed and the mistreatment of his child -- He says that Reed was the main witness in both cases &amp; made his statements to justices himself -- He prays the fines may be remitted &amp;#9758;</p>
