<lb/>For the Governor</p>
<p>At the <date when="1862-03">March Term, 1862</date>, of the Circuit Court for the County of Kenton John Singer, Ann his wife, Rachel and Charles his son and Daughter, the two latter aged, respectively, 18 &amp; 20 years, free Negroes, then residing in this City, were indicted under and in persuance of the 2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> 3<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> and 6<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> sections of "An Act concerning free Negroes, Mulattos and Emancipation" -- apprroved <date when="1860-03-03">March 3<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> 1860</date> sec 2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">o</hi></hi> Stantons R.S. p. 810-811= which Indictments are now pending and indetermined. </p>
<p>Many years ago, with the approbation of this community, an Act of our General Assembly, secured to John and his family certain enumerated principles in this Commonwealth and among others that of Council in this place where he has continued to reside to the present time -- I have known John nearly all my life, and I am not aware that John has either in his own person, or in those of his family abused the principles conferred upon them by the act mentioned, saw and except in the unfortunate, instances, which gave rise to the Indictments alluded to,</p>
<p>The public sentiment of this community, no less than the laws of the Commonwealth demanded and justify, the Indictment of John and his family= But, on the other hand, I think I may say, with equal confidence and with equal breadth of expression that the public sentiment of this Community palliates the Acts upon which the Indictments are founded on in the belief, that John, and consequently John's family, were honestly mislead, by a misapprehension in of their rights and duties, both as to the <hi rend="underline">special</hi> law in their favor and the particular and most recent law, under which they have been Indicted -- </p>
<p>I concur in every thing that has been expressed in the within petition in reference to the uniform propriety and probity of John's life -- I think the Indictments in question, have already produced a salutary efect in the right quarter, and that the<pb/>
<lb/>effect will be rather increased than diminished, (in this particular instance), by extending a free pardon to these otherwise meritorious negroes -- </p>
<p>I have written this note at the request of Citizens and menbers of the Grand Jury, eminent for their public and private worth some of whose names appear signed to the accompaning petition and ^are^ well known to the Executive </p>

<p>I heartily concur with the foregoing recommendation, having known John Singer since my residence in Covington. An honest, more accommodating, and gentlemanly "gentleman of color," it would be hard to find. I am satisfied his violation of law complained of was the result of mistake, not malice</p>

<lb/>Indictment against John Singer &amp; others
<lb/>Pardon Iss<hi rend="sup">d</hi> <date when="1862-06-09">June 9. 1862</date><pb/></p>
<p>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin 
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky. </p>
<p>At the <date when="1862-03">March Term 1862</date> of the Kenton Circuit Court, indictments were found against John Singer, his wife ^(Ann)^ and daughter about 18 years old named Rachael and his son Charles about 20 years of age, for going out of the state and returning and residing in Convington -- they being free blacks. </p>
<p>Singer has been a resident Covington for nearly thirty years. He has raised his family here. He is a Barber, and has pursued his business, diligently and has been all the time a quiet, orderly, well behaved man -- remarkable for his quiet unoffensive demeanor, and for the propriety of his life The same may be said of his family. Neither one of them have ever before been called to answer a charge for the breach of any law state or municipal before -- and they all have the confidence and respect of all our people. They erred without being aware of the law and we are satisfied an act of great justice and propriety would be done on pardoning them this their first offence We respectully and earnestly ask that your Excellency will pardon them </p>
