   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Govenor Bramlette</p>
<p>Your petitioner Oscar Sullinger states that he was on the <date when="--06-08">8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of June</date> fined by the Police Judge of Frankfort $50 -- for carrying a concealed deadly weapon. He states that he is frequently detained in town late enough to be a part of the time riding home at night which is six miles from town, and it is generally Known that he carries money upon his person for purposes of trading, such being his only occupation. Such being the case, he, for purposes of personal safety, has carried lately a pistol when riding, and not with an intention of personal assault. That he conceives that the troubled condition of the times when the country is filled with runaway negroes, guerillas and returned Soldiers who are deserters and desperate characters, that his personal safety required such action, He thought he would be detained until late this evening in going home -- </p>
<p>He states that several persons in his<pb/>
<lb/>immediate neighborhood have been of late robbed and otherwise interfered with by Small squads of as few as three persons.</p>
<p>He respectfully petitions for a remission of one half of said fine, being a balance of $20. of fine and costs to pay</p>
<p>Oscar Sullinger</p>
<p>Subscribed and Sworn to before me this <date when="--06-08">8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of June</date> by Oscar Sullinger above named -- </p>
