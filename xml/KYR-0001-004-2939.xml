   <p>Daniel M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Carty was Indicted at the <date when="--04">April</date> term of the Circuit Court <hi rend="str">f</hi>accused of Grand larceny, the testimony was verry meagre, but he was said to be a suspicious character from Philadelphia, while here he had formed the acquaintance of some very respectable persons, and raised their sympathy, he was in jail awaiting his trial -- and he told his friends that he desired to go home to see his family who was sick and he would return in time to stand his trial -- there upon one Mr James Fish went his Bail for Three hundred Dollars -- he McCarty went him but near returned, Mr Dupuy the Commonwealths attorney as well as evry one else has said that no doubt this was the best way to get rid of McCarty -- as it was very doubtful weather he could <hi rend="str">m</hi> have made out a case against him and the state and got rid of a su<hi rend="str">s</hi>spicious character, Beleaving therfore that the state has already been benefeited by Mr Fish going on said McCartys Bond, as it is presumed we have got rid of a suspicious character that the<pb/>
<lb/>Law could not reach, we pray your Honour will remit at least a part of Mr Fishs Forfeiture</p>
