   <p>Statement of the Testimony before the Court in case of the Commonwealth against W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> T. Orr</p>
<p>Charles M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Carty &amp; Alfred B. Cochran were going home to dinner. Opposite the door of Orrs shop they saw Orr with his head out of the door. Orr jumped out &amp; asked M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Carty if "he sent that Valentine to his sister" M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Carty replied "No I did not". Orr responded "You son of a bitch I am going to kill you" &amp; struck M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Carty over the head with a heavy peice of hickory about 15 inches long &amp; a larger knot on the end of it. He followed This blow up with two others, stunning M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Carty &amp; cutting his head badly. Someone interfered &amp; M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Carty got loose &amp; started to run from him. Orr followed him up &amp; caught him &amp; struck him several blows with the same peice of wood cursing him and threatening to kill him each blow he stuck. When Orr was finally taken away from M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Carty &amp; M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Carty started away, Orr shouted, "go you damned son of a bitch, if I ever catch you in this end of town again I will take your life.</p>
<p>The above is a fair statement of the evidence.</p>
