<lb/>Honble B McGoffen
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>My friends unsolicited by me have placed my name before you for the Judgeship of this District, appreciating your position, I hope you will pardon me in saying that I only suffered it, to accomodate their wishes of preferance, and that the office is by no means desirable to me, and haveing conversed with, many both in this and other countys, I am satisfied that Daniel B Lacey of Owingsville Bath County will meet the hearty approval of all parties, he is a good Lawyer a man of unquestioned integrity a Union man, yet will as a Judge<pb/>
<lb/>=dge be guided by the Constitution &amp; Laws of the land, he will have no Friends to Favour or enemys to punish -- he filled the office of attorney for the district for many years, to the satisfaction of all parties &amp; is personally &amp; favourably known to every body in the district -- at his appointment none can complain as the Democrats are largely in the asscendency, and the Union men have no right to dictate who you shall appoint, as he is union, that is all they can ask, it would be injust while they are in the minority that the majority should be denied, to sellect out of their ranks the man -- that the majority is as here stated, the votes at the last election &amp; for ten years preceeding clearly show -- he is sufficiently known to Justify his ap<pb/>
<lb/>pointment with application or recommendation, over the applicants, -- and it will be the more Honourable as it is not sought by him.</p>
<p>I have thus freely expressed my wish &amp; your Friend in this quarter.</p>
<p>Yours Respectfully
<lb/>K Farrow</p>
<p>P. S. This is private &amp; confidential</p>
<p>K. Farrow</p>
