   <p><hi rend="underline">To His Excellency
<lb/>Tho. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Gov</hi><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi><hi rend="underline"> of Kentucky;</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="underline">Daniel. W. Egleston</hi>, your petitioner, respectfully states that he is a resident of Covington; and has been engaged for a number of years in keeping in said city a licensed restaurat and eating house; that in <date when="1864-03">March last</date> he was somewhat astonished to learn he had been indicted by the grand jury, for what affense he knew not; that upon inquiry he ascertained said charge <hi rend="str">for</hi> was for selling liquor to one Thomas Dickey -- a minor -- whom your petitioner knew but slightly, and as a man in business; that said Dickey proved, on trial of the cause, he had drank a glass of liquor at the house of your petitioner during the <hi rend="underline">Christmas holidays of</hi> <date when="1863"><hi rend="underline">1863</hi></date> (your petitioner did not remember the circumstance) and that he, Dickey, was 21 years old in <date when="1864-02-05">February the <hi rend="str">th</hi> 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 1864,</date> only 5 or 6 weeks after Christmas. Your petitioner plead he did not know said Dickey was under 21, had no means of knowing so; and was deceived by his appearance, which<pb/>
<lb/>certainly indicated him to be one and twenty. But the Court overruled such plea, stating that was a matter for Executive clemency.</p>
<p>Your petitioner was fined $<hi rend="underline">50</hi> at the <date when="1864-12"><hi rend="underline">December term</hi> for <hi rend="underline">1864</hi></date> of the <hi rend="underline">Kenton Circuit Court</hi>.</p>
<p>He prays for a remission of this fine. His Error was done without the least design on his part to violate any penal law; and he has never been indicted for any violation of penal law save in the matter above referred to=</p>

<p>As acting <hi rend="underline">Attorney for the Commonwealth</hi> during the <date when="1864-12">December term for 1864</date> of the Kenton Circuit Court I can certify that in the case of the Commonwealth vs <hi rend="underline">Daniel W. Egelston</hi>, indicted for selling liquor to a minor, which was tried at said <date when="1864-12">December term,</date> it was proved that the minor, <hi rend="underline">Thomas</hi> <hi rend="underline">Dickey</hi>, who was alleged to have procured said liquor from defendant -- the keeper of a restaurant -- drank the same during the <hi rend="underline">Christmas holidays</hi> of <date when="1863"><hi rend="underline">1863</hi>;</date> and that said Dickey was one and twenty years of age on the <date when="1864-02-05"><hi rend="underline">5</hi><hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi><hi rend="underline"> day of February 1864</hi>,</date> or about five or six weeks thereafter.</p>

<p>I learned all the Evidence in the case of the Commonwealth vs Egleston (J. R. Hallam Esq. then acting as atty for the Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">wth</hi></hi>) and remember the substance of the same distinctly. The witness -- Thomas Dickey -- who testified he drank the liquor at Mr. Dan<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Egleston's during the Christmas holidays of <date when="1863">1863</date> -- and shortly after Christmas to the best of<pb/>
<lb/>my remembrance -- also testified he was 21 years of Age on the <date when="1864-02-25">5<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of February 1864</date> -- I think -- or about <hi rend="underline">5</hi> or <hi rend="underline">6 weeks only</hi> after the drinking was alleged to have been done. Said witness -- Thomas Dickey -- looked to me as if he were a man grown; and from his appearance, in the absence of positive evidence as to his age, I should have taken him to be <hi rend="underline">about 22 years old</hi>. I am satisfied also Mr Egleston was deceived as to the age of this person; and never intended to violate any law in selling him liquor.</p>
