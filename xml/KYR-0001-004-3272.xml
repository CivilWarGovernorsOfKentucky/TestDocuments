  <body>
   <p>To His Excellency Gov. Thomas E. Bramlette. Gov. of the State of Ky.</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Floyd county. State of Indiana. would respectfully present to your excellency, that we are acquaintances, neighbors of Josiah Eaton, and citizens of the county afd. that he, the said Eaton, was lately convicted of the crime of Horse Stealing in the Jefferson Circuit Court and Sentenced to the Kentucky State Penitentiary for the term of four years.</p>
<p>That he was guilty we have no doubt for we are informed that he plead guilty on the trial; but we would Suggest that up to this charge of Horse Stealing, we had never heard any charge of dishonesty alledged against him. He had lived in the county for Several years, and ^had^ been engaged industriously in pursuing his trade viz: that of a <hi rend="underline">plasterer</hi>; and was an excellent workman and good mechanic, and made a good living for himself &amp; family, as we thought and believed, in an honest way. We think that <hi rend="str">in as</hi> in view of the fact, that he was probably Seduced into the matter by others, at an ill guarded moment as a <hi rend="str">just</hi><pb/>
<lb/>matter offering a fine oportunity for making money, ^without properly considering the guilt of the thing:^ <hi rend="underline"><hi rend="str">after the guerilla made</hi></hi> and of the further facts, that he has a clever honest wife and few Small children who are destitute of money or means, or of relations or friends who are able to help them, to procure the means of Subsistence; and that he has already Suffered Severely for his Sins- having had one of his fingers Shot off and, being otherwise injured when he was caught and arrested; and having lain in Jail in Louisville about 10 months, and being Sick most of that time in a word, having already experienced the fact, "<hi rend="underline">that</hi> <hi rend="underline">the way of the transgressor is hard</hi>". we think he has Suffered enough to Satisfy the demands of the law.</p>
<p>And in consideration of these facts, and further, that he Seems thoroughly penitent, and determined to live honestly in the future: and that in our opinion the public good does not demand that his wife and children Should be deprived of him their only Stay and means of Support for the term of 4 years we would respectfully pray that your excellency extend to him the benefit of your pardoning power and restore him to his des-titute and distressed wife &amp; children.<pb/>
