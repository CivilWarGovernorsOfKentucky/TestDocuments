<lb/>Hon. H. D. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Henry
<lb/>Frankfort Ky
<lb/>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>We have prepared a petition to-day to Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Bramlette, asking him to remit a forfeiture entered against the Bail of one Tho'<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> Howard. Howard was taken out by Carrol L. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cown of So. Carrolton Ky. with the intention of puting him in the Army as a substitute, he was refused, and made his escape from M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Cown, who had in consequence of this fact, to procure another substitute for himself at a Cost of about $850<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cown is poor, is an honest Mechanic, has to make his living by hard labour; to pay all this will well nigh ruin him. I got up the petition, not as a lawyer, working for a fee, but as a friend of M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi>Cown, who is worthy of the friendship of any one; And I beg you, as a friend of mine, to use your utmost influence with Governer Bramlette to secure his release from this bond, and<pb/>
<lb/>also that of the others connected with him. Now I am in earnest about this matter. Please do your best for him.</p>
<p>Ask John R. Thomas Esq<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. for me to use his influence in this matter</p>
<p>Sincerely
<lb/><hi rend="underline">J. R. Strange</hi>.</p>
<p>P. S. A goodly number of us will be at the Convention at Calhoun. Our people prefer you, and are exceedingly anxious for you to make the race</p>
<p>Truly
<lb/><hi rend="underline">J. R. Strange</hi>.</p>
<p>N. B. Howards offence was that of taking about $7<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">50</hi></hi> worth of clothing</p>
