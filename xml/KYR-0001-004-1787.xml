   <p>To the Govenor of the State of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned, states that at the <date when="1865-05">May term of the Graves Circuit Court 1865.</date> a Judgment was rendered against him for Five Hundred Dollars in favor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky which we based on a Recognizance executed by W. J. Bennett <hi rend="str">as</hi> ^as principal^ petitioner as his surety for his appearance to answer a criminal charge against him on indictment in said Court Which Recognizance was executed at the <date when="1860-06">June term of the Graves Circuit Court 1860,</date> Petitioner states that since the execution of said recognizance said Bennett has left the state of Kentucky and Joined the rebel army. and has continued out of the state ever since, which act of his in favoring the Rebellion was against the will of Petitioner, he says he is a very poor man &amp; to pay the amount of said Judgment will almost impoverish him, he therefore asks your Excellency to interpose and relief him from said Judgment,</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">M, D, Morgan</hi><pb/></p>
<p>we are well acquainted with M. D. Morgan and say that the statements contained in the foregoing petition are true, and we earnestly ask that Your Excellency interpose in his behalf, as it is a case which calls for interposition

<p>Believing this a case in which the Clemency of the Governor ought to be exercised we recommend his interposition -- I have no idea Morgan ever <unclear/> at the absince of Bennett, &amp; he could not control his movements owing to pressure of guerrillas</p>
