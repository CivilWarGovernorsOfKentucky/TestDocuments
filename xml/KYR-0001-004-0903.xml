<lb/><date when="1864-05-26">26th May 1864</date>
<lb/>To his Excellency 
<lb/>Thomas E Bramlette 
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky </p>
<p>The undersigned would beg to represt that at the <date when="1863-09">September Term of the Ballard circuit court for the year 1863</date>, James M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Caulley, and one I W Garrett, partners, in a grocery or Coffee House establishment were tried upon an indictment charging them with keeping a gameing house<hi rend="str"> &amp;</hi> found guilty &amp; fined the sum of two Hundred Dollars. Capies issued upon the Judgement, and were repleived by the parties, thus securing the debt to the Commonwealth. </p>
<p>Now the undersigned would further beg to represent that so far as McCaulley is concerned, the Case is certainly one in which the executive aught- if it is ever right to do so- to interpose the perogative of Mercy. Mr. M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Caulley is quite a poor man, and quite a sober orderly Citizen, and one who has but seldom been charged, with any violations of the law. He is suffering under great bodily infirmity, and is wholy unable to<pb/> 
<lb/>support himslef and family by labor. </p>
<p>Although he has been <hi rend="str">unk</hi> known to the undersigned but - for a short time - say 18 monthes, he feels a perfect assurance, justified by his constant uniform, and general good conduct, <hi rend="str">he fills </hi>that if your excellency shall feel inclined to remit any portion of the fine for his benefit, that the charity will be fully justified from any and every point of veiw. </p>
<p>Taking the foregoing view of the case the undersigned humbly trust that your Excelency will find it not inconsistant with the Public <unclear/>, to interpose in Mr M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Cauley's behalf, and remit so much of the one half of the fins as may be going to the state, say about the sum of $66.66, in his favor</p>
<p>Very Respectully your Excelency's most obt svt
