<p>Affiant James A. Johnson says he has been well acquainted with both Thomas B. Wadlington and M. A. Cartwright since his boyhood, and that the character of Wadlington has allways been mild, good tempered upright, peaceable and honest -- That he has known him to shun difficutlties, even to being imposed on; While on the other hand Cartwright has been a quarrellsome, high-tempered man, and violator of the public peace -- He says he is acquainted with the general moral character of John Prince and James Blalock ^and^ for truth and veracity, and from that character and from his own knowledge he does know that in one particular at least, and that an important one, that John Prince swore falsely on the trial of Thomas Tho B. Wadlington, and he would not and could not believe either of them in a court of justice on oath -- </p>
