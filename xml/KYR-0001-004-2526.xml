<lb/>To his Excellency,
<lb/>Thomas. E. Bramlett
<lb/>Governor of Ky -- </p>
<p>Your Petitioner Gideon, Gregory,
<lb/>Begs leave to state that at the the <date when="1864-10">october Term 1864</date> of the Monroe Circuit Court, his son John. Gregory was indicted by the Grand Jury of Monroe County for Grand Larceny, and was afterwards arrested and lodged in Jail, and your petitioner, being prompted by the strong paternal feelings that the humane father always feels toward an erring son, entered into a bail bond in the sum of Three hundred &amp; fifty dollars for the appearance of his son and at the <date when="1865-04">April Term 1865</date> his said son failing to appear said bond was forfeited and at the <date when="1865-10">october Term 1865</date>, Judgment was rendered against your Petitioner for the full amount of said bond your Petitioner would further state that he is quite an oald man and quite poor, so infirm that he is unable to labour except in part for<pb/>
<lb/>his support, and if he is compeled to pay the full amount of said bond it will leave him in almost a destitute condition and as he is unable to perform anything like labour enough ^to^ support himself he feels that his condition will be truly deplorable if he is compeled to pay the full amount of said bond wherefore your Petitioner prays Your Excellency to take into consideration the feelings that an indulgent father has for his son notwithstanding that son may ere, together with the other facts stated in this Petition and if you can consistent with what you deem to be right remit that part of said bond going to the commonwealth</p>
<p>Gideon ^his X mark^ Gregory</p>
<p>Sworn to before me by Gideon Greggery this <date when="1865-10-03">3<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> day of october 1865</date></p>
