<lb/>To His Excellency Gov: Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We were of counsel for Milton Taylor in the case of Commonwealth of Kentucky against him for Keeping a disorderly house, on which Mr T. was fined $135 -- at the last Term of the Mason Circuit Court. As a matter of course we cannot now, recollect the precise statements of the witnesses on the trial of this case, but it was shown that the house, in which the disorder complained of, was suffered, had been occupied by various tenants, for many years past, say ten or twelve years, and at the time, complained of was, occupied, and had been for some time past, <hi rend="str">been</hi> occupied ^by^ a family of free blacks, tenants of Mr Taylor, We therefore at the time &amp; still think, that the court erred in their rulings in the case; that the tenants, &amp; not Mr T, should have been held responsible for the disorders complained of.</p>
<p>There was a good ^deal^ of feeling against Mr T. at the time, particularly on the part of some of the witnesses</p>
<p>Most Resp'y your obt
<lb/>servts
