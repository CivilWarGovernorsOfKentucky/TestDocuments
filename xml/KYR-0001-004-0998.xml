<lb/>Governor T E Bramlette
<lb/>Frankfort Ky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>There are four Judgments of the Simpson Circuit Court each in favor of the Commonwealth, and against Shelby Harwell. And each for One hundred dollars, for suffering prisoners to escape from the Jail of Simpson County.</p>
<p>Mr Harwell was Jailer of the County under an appointment by the County Court, (the regular Jailer having resigned,) and accepted the position much against his Inclination, and at the Solicitation of his friends. And at the time the escapes were made from the Jail for which he was Indicted (last fall) the federal Military Authorities were using the Jail. And the persons who escaped were offenders, who had been captured by the Military Authorities. And handed over to the Courts for trial. A portion of them were desperate characters. One had brake Jail previously. And the Jail was not a strong one.</p>
<p>Mr Harwell at the time had an afflicted family That is a wife who was, &amp; had for years been Subject to fits of Insanity<pb/>
<lb/>rendering it improper that he should reside in the Jail building.</p>
<p>Mr H<hi rend="sup">'s</hi> wife is still afflicted, and is now in the Lunatic Asylum at Lexington. At her husbands expense. In view of the facts at tending the case, and the circumstances surrounding Mr Harwell. I am satsified that it would be right, to relieve him of the Judgments to the extent of your constitutional power, and I so request</p>
<p>Respectfully &amp;c.
<lb/>Wm B Jones Atty for the Comth</p>
<p>I concur with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Jones in his foregoing petition
<lb/>Asher W Graham
<lb/>Court Judge 4. dist Ky.<pb/></p>
<p>Statement of Atty for Comth and Court
<lb/>S Harwells case.</p>
