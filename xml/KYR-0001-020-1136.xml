<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>I am in Marion today and have Just finished a speach and have to go from this to Madisonville whilst here I learned that three of my friends towit D A Butler J S Lowey &amp; W B Travis at the last term of the circuit court was fined in the agregate $1250<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> the particulars I suppose will be detaled in other letters and <hi rend="str">from what I have learned I</hi> for an assault and from what I learn the fine was excessive and in fact but a very small fine if any should have been imposed and I am satisfied that it is a case that calls for the<pb/>
<lb/>executive clemency I would therefore request as a favour that you remit the fine except cost the parties having stated as I understand the portion due the Comths Atty which of itself I believe to be a heavy fine</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Your Obedt
<lb/>Servant
<lb/>H. C. Burnett</p>
