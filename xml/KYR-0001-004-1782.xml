   <p>His Excellency, Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. E. Bramlette,
<lb/>Govenor of Kentucky; -- </p>
<p>Your petitioner, Peter Vanarsdall States that at the <date when="1865-05">May term, 1865,</date> of the Mercer Circuit Court, just past, he was fined in the sum of $73 on a charge of a misdemeanor, the indictment having been found at the <date when="1864-11">November term, 1864</date>, of said Court against Guilford Yeast, William Yeast and this affiant, the two former of whom were not tried. He states that on the <date when="1864-09-10">10<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of September, 1864,</date> the two said Yeasts and J. C. and Robt. Dean had a dificulty in Harrodsburg while this affiant was at home in the country about five miles from town. He states that the said Yeasts were going home on the same day from town in the evening and Stopped at the house of Your petitioner which stands immediately on the road. He states that after a while the said Deans came along the road on their way home, and the Yeast who were at the yard fence of Your petitioner and the said Deans got into a difficulty and shot at one another -- Petitioner states that at the time said difficulty occurred he was in his own house waiting on a sick woman, and knew nothing of the difficulty until he heard the shooting in the road in front of his house; that he then went out of his house and saw what was<pb/>
<lb/>going on, and that the part he took it the fight was simply to try to stop it -- that he used his endeavored to this point -- was no party in the affray and had no interest whatever in it -- He states that he was included in the indictment against the Yeasts, and thinking it a matter of no importance to him, as he felt innocent, he made no preparation to defend the charge and summoned no witnesses. That the testimony of the prosecutor, Dean, tended to implicate your petitioner as Coming out of his house to aid the Yeasts, when in fact Your petitioner solemnly states on oath that he took no part in it except to quit the difficulty -- that the shooting was all done before your affiant came out of the house -- that he had nothing to do with the fight in any way from first to last, but was quietly at home unexpecting any thing of the kind -- For these reasons he petitions your Excellency to remit the fine against him.</p>
<p>He says the statements in the foregoing petition are true -- </p>
