<lb/>Smith Wingate Esqr
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>In answer to your letter requesting a statement from me as to my recollection of the agreement between you &amp; R Hutchinson late atto for the Comth. I state from the best of my recollection that, it was agreed between you &amp; him that W B. Vallandingham should take his case (a similar one to yours) to the Court of Appeals, and that your case would abide the decision in Vallandinghams case. That case was taken to the Court of Appeals &amp; I understand reversed. And no action was had in your case from <date when="1853-11">Nov 1853</date> until this winter, when a capias pro fine was issued at the instance of T S Haydon agent for the Auditor.</p>
<p>Resptfy. W H Sandford</p>
