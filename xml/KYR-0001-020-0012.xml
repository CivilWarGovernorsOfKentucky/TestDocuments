   <p>^To^ His Excellency Beriah Magoffin, Governor of the Commonwealth of Ky -- 
<lb/>Dear Sir -- </p>
<p>We the undersigned, citizens of Caldwell County Ky, have long Known Thomas. B. Wadlington &amp; he has ever been considered a good &amp; true hearted citizen, Known &amp; noted for his industry &amp; <hi rend="underline">orderly</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">peaceable</hi> conduct -- The difficulty in which he was engaged with M. A. Cartwright did not appear to us, to be of his seeking, nor are we satisfied nor do we believe the case was fairly presented to the Jury as it occurred -- We hope your Excellency will review the case &amp; give the poor man the benefit of any doubt, &amp; we desire that his case may be judged in mercy &amp; regarded with favor &amp; that your Excellency will take into consideration every circumstance that ought to operate in his behalf. And we desire that your Excellency may be ^&amp; will be^ persuaded, that it is consistent, with your duty, to extend to him Executive Clemency, and that his life may be spared, either by a full pardon or commutation of his punishment</p>
