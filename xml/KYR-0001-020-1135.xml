<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>At the request of many good friends in this county I take the liberty to address you upon a question that you are about to be called upon to decide: I can only say that I was one of the Jury to try, D. A. Butler for an Assault and Batery at the last Term of our Circuit Court upon the person of one Woodsides. the Jury could not do otherwise than render the verdict, ^<hi rend="str">then</hi>^ they did; but, at the same time I do not think that Butler intended any thing more than to ascertain whether Woodsides was guilty of Stealing some money that he had been charged with stealing; Butler<pb/>
<lb/>did not hurt him as it seemed from the evidence but Striped him and threatened him with the whip and did strike him but did not hurt him, Butler is a peacable, quiet good citizen, and has never ben known to violate the laws of the Land before the other two men, Travis V Lowry it seems ware only accessory to the act and all good peacable citizens; if you can consistently remit the fines. I think the peopl here would sustain you in such a course, the petition will be forwarded in a few days; Excuse bad writing</p>
<p>Respectfully
<lb/>Isaac N. Clement</p>
