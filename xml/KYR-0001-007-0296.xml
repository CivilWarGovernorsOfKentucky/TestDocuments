<lb/>J. R. Page Esqr.
<lb/>D Sir</p>
<p>Your note of the <date when="1864-09-07">7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Inst</date> came duly to hand asking me to recommend. I am suitable person to fill the office of Justice of the Peace for Districty No 2. in place of H M Crow. I cannot recommend B. A. Golliher on account of qualification and locality. He has been a constable for several years (one Term) and done badly. He is loyal, but <hi rend="underline">not</hi> qualified besides he lives very near Tho Price the remaining Justice of the District who lives on Mouldrow hill. The people of the District who live under the hill on the River suffer incovenience to have to go on the hill to do their business all in the same place. I would suggest the name of Franklin Johnson who lives on the river in the bottom, who was for many years and acting Member of Our County Court Who is loyal and well qualified -- and whose locality will suit the people conveniently for the prosecution of their business -- If you commission M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Johnson said his commission to New Haven as he lives in 1/2 Mile of that office.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Johnson is no way related to Me and in suggesting him, I am influenced only by a proper motive for the instant of my people</p>
<p>Yrs very respectfully
