   <p>Newport, Ky, <date when="1865-01-26">Jan, 26<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> 1865 -- </date>
<lb/>To Hon, Thomas E. Bramlett,
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>Dear Sir: -- In the month of <date when="1863-05">May 1863,</date> Robert W. Becroft, a worthy young man employed as a Clerk in a Commission House in the City of Cincinnati, at the request of Mrs Pancost, whose Husband was then confined in the Newport Jail, charged with Grand Larceny, ordered a key to be made by a Locksmith in Cincinnati, and carried and delivered it to Mrs Pancost -- Shortly afterwards Pancost escaped from Jail, by means, as is supposed, of that key. It is supposed that Mrs Pancost, who frequently visited her Husband in the Jail furnished the Key. Pancost was, however, subsequently recaptured and admitted to Bail.</p>
<p>The young man when charged with complicity in the escape frankly explained all his conduct relative to the key, and solemnly asseverated that he did not know or suspect the<pb/>
<lb/>object of the key. He had only delivered Mrs Pancost's instructions to the Locksmith, at her request, recived and paid for the key with her money, and delivered the key to her.</p>
<p>The Grand Jury of Campbell County Ky. on substantially the above state of fact, in <date when="1863-08">August 1863,</date> Indicted Becroft for "aiding Pancost to escape," and Becroft, on the <gap/> day of <date when="1863-08">August 1863,</date> with his relative Mrs Mary K. Williamson as his surety, was recognized in open Court, in the penalty of Five Hundred dollars for his appearance at the ensuing <date when="1864-02">February Term of said Court in 1864.</date></p>
<p>Becroft was a young man of excellenct character, simple-hearted and unsuspecting. He became very much alarmed, and just prior to the <date when="1864-02">February Term of said Court</date> he unaccountably disappeared and has not since been heard from and his whereabouts are unknown. It is conjectured he joined a friend of his, in a Regiment of Pennsylvania Soldiers. <hi rend="underline">en</hi> <hi rend="underline">route</hi> by<pb/>
<lb/>way of Cincinnati to the South-west.</p>
<p>Mrs Mary K. Williamson believes him to be perfectly innocent. She had the most perfect confidence and belief that he would stand his trial and she deeply regrets his misterious absence. Mrs Williamson is a most excellent Lady, a Widow with a slender income. She is burdened with a family of children to raise and educate, and if required to pay the penalty of the recognizance will be irreparably injured. The recognizance has been forfeited and a judgment against her is impending.</p>
<p>We think if any case is commended to the Governor's clemency it is this.</p>
<p>We therefore cordially and earnestly recommend to your Excellency the remission of the penalty of the recognizance.</p>
