<lb/>Military School.</p>
<p>A gentleman by the name of Austin, from Arkansas, announced on yesterday, at Mayfield, that he was moving to Columbus, Ky., for the purpose of establishing a Military School, and that his baggage consisted of eight 32-pounders and a car load of small arms, Irish buggies, &amp;c. He invited all the young men of the Purchase to attend his institution. He also announced that if there was a Lincolnite present, he desired him to go with all haste to Cairo and inform Gen. Prentiss of the fact, for if he did not go quick, Frentiss would not be able to take his <hi rend="italic">baggage</hi>.</p>
<p>We wish this Institution the greatest success.</p>
