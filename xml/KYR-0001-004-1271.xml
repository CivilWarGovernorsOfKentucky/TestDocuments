<lb/>To his Excellency
<lb/>The Govinor of Kentucky</p>
<p>The undersigned, James Pennington, represents to your Excellency that at the <date when="1864-08">August Term 1864</date> of the Boyle Circuit Court, he was fined three several times, the aggregate sum of one Hundred Dollars for Keepin Tipling House, and that it is for relief from said fines that he makes this appeal to your Excellency</p>
<p>He states that he has no mode of relief from said fines but in Executive clemency. That said fines were unjustly imposed: That your Petitioner was not guilty of Keeping a Tipling House, as charged nor was he guilty as he knew, or believed, of any breach of Con. He says he has a defense to said charges, but owing to unavoidable circumstanes he was absent from Court, and that the Counsel employed by him, permitted said Judgment to go by default, thereby rendering this appeal to ^your^ Excellency necessary. That he hopes and promises never again to trouble your Excellency for clemency with like appeal</p>
<p>James Pennington</p>
<p>The following ^persons^ respectfully request your Exceltency the Govinor of Kentucky to grant the appeal contained in above</p>
