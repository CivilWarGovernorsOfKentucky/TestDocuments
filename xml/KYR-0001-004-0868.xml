<p>Harry Mitchell a worthy citizen of this county was found guilty under Two indictments of selling liquor to infants. The young men who he sold the whisky are quite grown and in the habit of doing business for themselves I am satisfied that Mitchell at the time ^he sold the whisky^ was not aware of the crime he was committing against the Laws of his state being an Honest man, poor and with a large Family to support. I beg in his and his Family behalf <hi rend="str">fo</hi> for a remit of the fines</p>
