   <p>Winchester Ky <date when="1858-11-10">Nov 10 1858</date>
<lb/>Gov<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Morehead
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>Allen T. Ryan was indicted in the Clark Circuit Court several years since for the Murder of Francis M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Donald -- He was admitted to bail with Surety in the sum of $5000 -- He attended regularly, was tried once which resulted in a Hung Jury -- He was again bailed in the sum of $5000 -- He continued to appear up to <date when="1858-06">June Spring Term 1858</date> at which term his recognizance was respited with the assent of Samuel W. Chiles, Caleb Parrish, Joseph Jones, &amp; Richard M Webb, the other sureties in the recognizance four in number not being present &amp; not consenting to the respite -- At July Special Term Ryan failed to appear, the recognizance was forfeited, and scire facias issued, and at <date when="1858-11">November Term 1858</date> Judgment was rendered against Chiles, Parrish, Jones &amp; Webb for $5000, and they now ask to be released &amp;c.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ryan was a young man of remarkably mild and agreeable manners, his character above reproach &amp; strongly marked by his devotion and affectionate treatment of his parents. He is quite a young man, at the time of the offense not over 21 or 22 years old, and was in every regard a man of good character -- <pb/>
<lb/>It is not strange then that altho Ryan himself -- was penniless, yet his friends came forward to go his bail -- No one doubted up to the day set for Trial (<date when="1858-07-28">28 July 1858</date>) that he would appear -- His sureties were surprised at the intelligence of his default -- They had not, I am satisfied, any agency in his having, and had no indemnity -- Neither Ryan nor his father having the Means of payng any part of the bond -- </p>
<p>The parties against whom the Judgment was rendered are all citizens of Clark County of eminent worth &amp; respectablility, and I believe I speak the literal truth when I say that there is not one person in the County who desires to see them suffer by the default of Ryan. They will have to pay the Com<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Atty $1500. of course -- I also believe that the <hi rend="str">feeling is</hi> general ^feeling^ through the County, is that of gratification that Ryan has gone -- His amiability of character has produced that feeling -- Upon the whole case I do not hesitate to say that your Excellency may very properly interpose in behalf of the parties against whom Judgment was rendered.</p>
<p>Yours Resply
<lb/>A. H. Buckner Clk
<lb/>Clark Cir Court</p>
