<lb/>Hon Beriah Magoffin</p>
<p>Dear Sir -- I have just been requested to sign a petition to you for James Donahoe and refused to do so -- He has been fined during the present term of the Circuit Court for suffering gaming keeping a Tippling House and Disorderly House and I have no doubt is guilty in each case -- I know that he has for a long time been complained of and I cannot think your clemency would cause him to reform the character of either himself or house. He will doubtless present the usual petition names only signed perhaps by persons who have not read it -- I know him and cannot say anything <hi rend="underline">to you</hi> <hi rend="underline">in his favor</hi> -- I have no feeling against him, except that as a slave holder and citizen I wish to inform you of the character of<pb/>
<lb/>his house and file this with you with the hope that in his case you will see that the law is faithfully executed"</p>
<p>He has no claims upon you</p>
<p>Very Respectfully
<lb/>Cha<hi rend="sup">s</hi> B Thomas</p>
<p>I have Just steped in Judge Thomas office I know Donahoe he wont do I am in hopes you will see him <unclear/></p>
