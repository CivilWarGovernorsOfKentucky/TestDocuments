<p>According to the request of my father (who is still a citizen of the United States) I address this letter to you.</p>
<p>He has taken the Amnesty oath and has made application for "<hi rend="underline">pardon</hi>" which he desires should be strengthined by a petititon from his friends which he wants you to influence Gov: Bramblette to endorse and forward to the President for his<pb/>
<lb/>special grace.</p>
<p>He bade us say to you that he had faith in your past friendship for him for judging your heart by his own -- it was unalterable</p>
<p>Any communication addressed to him will reach him if sent <hi rend="underline">here</hi> to us.</p>
<p>Desiring to be remembered to your wife and children whom we unchangingly love and in whom we shall ever take an interest I am without doubt</p>
<p>Very truly and politely
