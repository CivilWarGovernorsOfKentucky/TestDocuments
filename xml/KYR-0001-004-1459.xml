   <p>State of Kentucky
<lb/>Franklin County <hi rend="underline">Sct</hi></p>
<p>This day personally appeared before me a Justice of the Peace in &amp; for Franklin County William Mayer of the City of Nashville Tennessee. who made oath that he is now and has been for the last 20 years personally and intimately acquainted with William Kreppe now confined in the Kentucky Penitentiary for one year upon a charge of "Grand Larceny," committed in The City of Louisville, That said Kreppe up to the time of this unfortunate affair, has always sustained the character of honesty, morality, &amp; correct deportment. That said Kreppe is a native of Werterburg, Germany That he assisted said Kreppe in getting to the United States, about six years ago -- and that said Krepp since that time has worked &amp; been with affiant, That said Krepp in the early part of the Rebellion was a citizen of Nashville Tenn. and was then &amp; there forced to join the Rebel army where he served for 9 months, since his discharges from the army he has lived with affiant in Nashville up to the time that affiant went to Europe about 2 years since, &amp; brought the mother of said Krepp to this Country -- That he has either been with or heard from said Krep during the last six years, &amp; that no charge of bad conduct has ever before this one upon which he is now confined, been made against the honesty of said<pb/>
<lb/>Krepp, affiant says that he has been advised that a letter has been written to his Excellency the Governor, Thos. E. Bramlette, stating that the said Krepp has upon <hi rend="underline">other</hi> occasions been confined in the Nashville Jail -- affiant now states that this charge is incorrect &amp; false, That said Krepp -- has never, as affiant verily believes, been guilty of any other offense against the Laws of the land. That the mother of affiant is very old and poor &amp; has no other support except that derived from the labor of her only son the said Krepp -- Wherefore he writes unites with her in her petition for the pardon of her son -- </p>
