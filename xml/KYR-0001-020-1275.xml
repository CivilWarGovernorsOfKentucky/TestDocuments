<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Gov Magoffin</p>
<p><unclear>We'll</unclear> be waited upon with a Petition on behalf of Joseph Blackwell, who was fined two hundred dollars by a jury at the last Term of the Kenton Circuit Court, for keeping a Tipling House, for three months, I did not hear the proof, I know Mr Blackwell, He has but a small amount of property His wife keeps the House, generally, while he is away, She is a very worthy woman. They have two small children, Blackwell is in jail, unable to pay the fine. I have no doubt both he and his wife<pb/>
<lb/>will duly appreciate and gratefuly remember the Governor if he will remit, the whole or a part of the fine against Mr Blackwell.</p>
<p>I am satisfied they are utterly unable to pay the fine these hard times,</p>
<p>Respectfully &amp;c
<lb/>John, F, Fisk</p>
