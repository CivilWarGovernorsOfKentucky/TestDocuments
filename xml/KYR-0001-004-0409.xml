   <p>To the Governor of the Commonwealth of Ky</p>
<p>The undersigned citizens of Ohio County Ky respectfully ask you to remit a fine of one hundred Dollars imposed by the Ohio Circuit Court on Jesse W Megan a worthy young man of this County for betting a pair of Boots with one Charles K Metcalf on the result of the election in Ohio County at the <date when="1859-08">August election 1859</date> We say further that a fine for like amt was imposed on the Said Metcalf for some cause and by Executive Cemency the same was remitted we therefore ask you from the fact above and from the further fact that Mr Megan is quite a young man was entirely ignorant that he was violating any law of Ky when he made the bet and thought that he was released when Metcalf was at is was agreed that the petition which resulted in the release of Metcalf Should also have presented the case of Mr Megan and he did not know till very recently but what he was released. and further we believe that if Mr Megan is released he will not again violate the law of Ky in this particular</p>
