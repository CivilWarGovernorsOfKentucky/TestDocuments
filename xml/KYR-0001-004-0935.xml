<lb/>Dear Friend Wetmore,</p>
<p>One of our party is in trouble, and as you have been so ready to help us before, I take the liberty of appealing to you again, Lieut Buffum has been sentenced to the Kentucky State Prison for three years for stealing a pair of boots.</p>
<p>Does it not seem too bad, that he should have to serve this long term at home, after what he indured in the South? he may be and probably guilty of the crime alleged, as he had a weakness for intoxicating liquors and may have committed the theft, while under their influence, but should not his past services plead for him, and secure either his pardon or the commutation of his sentence; it seems to me that the sentence is a very severe one any way, and was made so by the sympathizers of Louisville, where he was tried because of his connection with the Railroad Adventure.</p>
<p>I think you will feel the same interest in this matter that I do, and your legal knowledge will suggest the most proper means to be used for his<pb/>
<lb/>relief;- I have ventured to write to Secretary Stanton asking his mediation with Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">c</hi></hi> Goffin, which note I enclose and beg you will lay it before him;- I feel a great desire to see my comrade released from this great difficulty</p>
<p>I have just been married
<lb/>Most truly Yours

<p>Respectfully referred to Hon. E. M. Stanton. Sec<hi rend="sup">y</hi> of War; stating that M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> W<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">m</hi></hi> Pittinger was author of the "Rail Road Adventure" and Lieut Buffum was one of the party, and I am inclined to think from what I learn, that there has been undue severity used in Buffums case, arising out of his noted free soil principles, while in Kansas and I ask that the influence of the Sect<hi rend="sup">y</hi> of War be used in obtaining executive clemency in this Lt Buffums case.</p>

<p>Respectfully referred to the Adjutant General to collect information upon the subject</p>
<p>By order of the Secretary of War.</p>
