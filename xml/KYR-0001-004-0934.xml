<p>At <date when="1848-08">August 1848</date>. the recognisance was forfeited &amp; scire facias and it was served on the security but was not served on him at all notwithstanding which a Judgment went, The reason he did not appear he had gone down the River &amp; was on his way back, in time but an accident befel the Boat hence the forfeiture The case went on no body paying any attention to the forfeiture &amp; he again gave Bail twice until ultimately at the <date when="1852-04">April Term 1852</date>. the prosecution was dismissed for want of prosecution he still not knowing that his Bail had been once forfeited, recently <unclear/> has issued against him &amp; his security and the only remedy is for you to remit the Judgment It ought to be done, he has been a quiet good citizen &amp; was in fact guilty of no dereliction</p>
<p>Please enclose to the clerk a remission of the Judgment He has often rendered us good service against Guerillas</p>
