<lb/>Sir -- </p>
<p>Some time since a petition was sent from Laurence County in behalf of my brother W F Moore asking the remission of Two fines assessed against him in the Laurence Circuit Court at its <date when="1864-04">April Term 1864</date> one for $60, and one for $20. and costs for keeping a Tippling house in the first case and selling liquor by retail in the other,</p>
<p>The facts were, that my brother was a partner of N. D Rheadhead in the the Sutlers department of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Ky Regiment and his partner sold whiskey against the wish and protest of my brother, -- and the partnership having been dissolved before court and my brother remaining the Sutler they indicted him <hi rend="str">the</hi>He ceased to sell liquor as soon<pb/>
<lb/>he got controll of the business and has sold none Since I enclose you a letter from the attorney of the commonwealth who prosecuted the cases which was written soon after the fines were assessed it speaks for itself, I hope you will find it consistent with your official duty to remitt these fines</p>
<p>I am Sir you obt Srvt &amp; friend
