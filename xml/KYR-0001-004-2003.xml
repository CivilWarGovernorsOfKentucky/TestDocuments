   <p>To his Excelency the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The undersigned a citizen of Hartford Ohio County Kentucky would represent to Your Honor that When the Rebellion broke out there was but one establishment in this town authorised by Licence to retail spiritous liquors by the drink and that house was kept by a man who was thought to be a simpathise with the South and consequently many of those of the Union party who drank would not patronise him, and there was a great demand for other establishments and some three or four sprung up without any license whatever, and during the time Co<hi rend="sup">l</hi> M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Henry was recruiting his Redgiment here there was a great many visitors to this place a great many of whom were <hi rend="str">visitors</hi> refugees from the districts ocupied by the Rebels and the dram &amp; Beer selling business was verry lucrative and Your petitioner being out of employment at that time in Consequence of the Rebellion and not able to labour for a living his ^health^ allways bad only weighing about 100 lbs altho 23 years old, thought that he too would embark in the Grocery business but not without Licence he obtained from the county court a Licence and not being acquainted with the law, he thought he was then authorised<pb/>
<lb/>sell spiritous Liquors as did the Tavern and did pursue the same in selling indiscriminately to all who applied as was done at the Tavern (But never permitted disorder) beleiving he had equal privileges under his licence, When at the March term of the Ohio circuit Court he was surprised when he learned that the Grand Jury had made out four Indictments against him for selling spiritous Liquors unlawfullly and was equally surprised when he learned there was no Indictments against several of the Citizens of This place who kept open houses and sold Liquor to all persons without any licence whatever during the whole time he has been engaged in the business. And he appeals to the citizens of this town &amp; county to say whether or not he kep as good order about his house as was kept by the tavern or other drinking establishments in this town, he claims that his Loyalty has never been doubted and can not see why the Grand Jury was so partial. Except that he was so unfortunate as to have been born in a foreign land, but not withstanding he has lived in the United States about 11 years and loves the Government of his adoption and would willing sacrafice all he owns (which is but little) for its maintainance perpetually Having stated all the facts honestly to Your<pb/>
<lb/>Honor he prays You to Exersise You Executive Clemency and releive him from the Indictments aforesaid, without which he will be left a Begar and no health of strength to labour for a living and besides may be immerced in Prison for he will not be able to raise the money to pay the fines &amp;c</p>
<p>Moses Baer</p>
<p>We the undersigned citizens of Hartford and Ohio County Join in the prayer of Moses Baer and we beleive he has Honestly stated the facts in his foregoing Petition and earnestly request his Excelency the Govenor of Kentucky to Exersise his Executive Clemency and relieve him entirely from the Indictments named in his Petition beliveing Your Honor will never have a case where Executive Clemency will be more appropriate</p>
<p>No body has been injured by him, he has violated the law ignorantly and will no doubt for the future regard his duties as a citizen strictly</p>
