<lb/>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky</p>
<p>Your Petitioner would humbly Represent that at the <date when="1860-09">sept. Term of the Pulaski Circuit Court in 1860</date> There was a Joint Inditement against <hi rend="underline">James</hi> <hi rend="underline">Doolin</hi> &amp; <hi rend="underline">L. D.</hi> <hi rend="underline">Garner</hi> upon which they were fined $20. Each for retailing ^spiritous liquor^ by the Quart being Merchants engaged in the sale of goods, wars, and Merchandise, we honestly believed we had a Right to sell by the Quart -- to have it taken off and not drank near the premises which was done -- at no time has Either of us violated the Laws of our country Except in that instance which was ignorantly done</p>
<p>on <date when="1860-10-02">Oct. 2<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> 1860</date> We petitioned your Excellency to Remit said fine <pb/>
<lb/>By petition including the within statements sworn to and cirtified by J. E. Cossin J. P. of Pulaski County <hi rend="str">with</hi> a great many of the best citizens in this county signed said Petition believing that it would be right for your Excellency to remit sd fine -- upon which your Excellency done us the Acknouledged favor -- to enter a Respite for Twelve months -- for that portion going to the Commonwealth -- since then L. D. Garner has gone to the State of Tennissee and i am told that i am responsible for the whole fine -- which will soon be Due i again humbly petition your Excellency to remit said fine believing as all your humble petitioners did. in my former petition that it would be right for your Excellency to remit said fine<pb/></p>
<p>Especialy at such times as this, when we can not get money to pay our Taxes -- if we cannot hold a Neutral position and are forced to pay for Prosicuting -- (as i think) and unjust Ware. -- </p>
<p>Yours Respectfully
<lb/><hi rend="underline">James Doolin</hi><pb/></p>
