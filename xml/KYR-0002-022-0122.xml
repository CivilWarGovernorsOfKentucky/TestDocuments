<lb/>Gov. T. E. Bramlette
<lb/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Adjt Genl, Lindsey informed me that this (Montgomery) County had credit for but 15 negroes in his officer. Upon the recept of this information I immediately appointed a Com<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. for this County, who has made out a list of the slaves, who have been regularly enlisted by a deputy Provost Marshal and also those who have <hi rend="str">gone into A</hi> left the County voluntarily &amp; gone to Camp Nelson &amp; also those who have joined, in some manner or other, regiments which were in our state, the whole number reported by said Com<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, so far, (and he is not quite through) is about One Hundred &amp; Fifty six (156), which report is forwarded to Com<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Flint at Louisville. </p>
<p>The balance, the Com<hi rend="sup">r</hi> for this county has failed to get up to this time, he will get in a very short time &amp; report them also. The greater portion of said slaves were enlisted here last Spring by a Deputy Pro. Marshal &amp; we understood that he would make out a descriptive list of each one &amp; forward it to the Adjt. Gen,s Office at Frankfort &amp; that we would by that means obtain full credit for them, but it now appears that it was not done. Had we not been thus mistaken we would have attended to this matter much earlier. You will please do the most you can to obtain for this county, previous to a draft, such credit as it is properly entitled to.</p>
<p>Those enlisted by the Dept. Pro. Marshal were taken to Greenupsburg Ky, which is H<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Quarters of W. C. Grier, Pro. Marshal of this district &amp; we<pb/>
<lb/>suppose was there mustered into service, but so far we have been wholly unable to ascertain the regt. or anything else, not having had time to write to W. C. Grier.</p>
<p>We understand the present Draft or call requires 245 men from this county -- from this most certainly should be deducted the negroes for which we are entitled to a credit. Knowing you have the full confidence of the loyal people of my county &amp; that you will do the best for them under the circumstances you possibly can</p>
<p>I remain your Obed<hi rend="sup">t</hi> servant
<lb/>Most Respctfly

<p>Stating that Gen. L- had informed him his county had credit for only 15 negroes. Says he appt<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> who investigated and found that 156 had enlisted -- with Dep. P. Mar. at Camp Nelson and with regts in state and that he had sent report to Com<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Flint at Louisville. There are some which he has not taken list of. but will soon. Would have attended to this earlier, but thought the P. Mar. would send their descriptive list to Frankfort. Those negroes enlisted by P. Mar. were taken to Greenupsburg Hd. Qrs. of Capt. W. C. Grier Dist. P. Mar. Have not had time to write to Capt. Grier. Hopes the Gov. will see that his county has full credit for all enlistments.<figure type="hr"/></p>
