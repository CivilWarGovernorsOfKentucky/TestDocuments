<lb/>Lexington <date when="1865-12-09">Dec 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1865</date></p>
<p>Maj I L Frost having been indicted before the <date when="--09">Sept</date> and <date when="--11">Nov</date> term of the Fayette Circuit Court on the charge of receiving a small mare knowing at the time that siad mare was the property of T Bacy and had been stolen her.</p>
<p>I herby make the following statement. I was at Maj Frosts house at the time said mare was received. And know that Maj Frost purchased her and paid $63 <hi rend="sup">65</hi>/<hi rend="sub">100</hi> for her. I was in the house at the time the trade was made but was present when the contact was closed and the bill of sale was given and considered at a fair and legitimate transaction between the parties. And am confident that Maj Frost did not know that said mare belong to T Bacy or any one else but the party of whom he purchased her</p>
<p>to the best of my recolection the statement is correct</p>
