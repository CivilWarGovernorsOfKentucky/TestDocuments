   <p>Vanceburg Lewis Co. Ky. <date when="1864-02-17">Febr 17" 1864</date>.
<lb/>His Excellency Governor Bramlette of Kentucky</p>
<p>Three years last fall I was found guilty by the commonwealth in the Court of Lewis Co. for selling Liquor by the drink my License only permitting the sale of Liquor by Quart The fine put on me for this was $60<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> beside the cost. In an address to his Excellency Governor Magoffin I prayed for the remittance of this fine or the grant of a new trial as I during of my trial was detained at home by sickness and not able to attend Court personaly. On this petition his excelency Governor Magoffin granted me a respite till last fall and as I thought by this time to make some money to pay of this heavy fine. But in last summer the early frost killed not alone my tobacco crop but the most of my vine too Therefore would I pray most humble that your Excellency may feel inclined to release me of the heavy fine for present and grant me if only <unclear/> months' longer respite for payment.</p>
<p>With full hope of the humanity and kindess of your Excellency in my case I shall remain</p>
<p>Your Excellency
<lb/>Very obedient
<lb/>W. Anthon<pb/></p>
<p>Lewis Co
<lb/>Refused</p>
