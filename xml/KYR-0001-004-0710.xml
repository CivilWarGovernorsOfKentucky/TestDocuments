   <p>To his Excellency Thomas E. Bramlette Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky-</p>
<p>Your Petitioner Milton Taylor a Citizen of Mason County, respectfully states, that at the <date when="--10">October Term</date> of the Mason Circuit Court, he was fined the sum of one Hundred and Thirty Five Dollars for permitting a disorderly House to be kept on his Farm near the City of Maysville. The plea of not guilty on his part was not a mere formal one, but was a sincere and honest declaration of want of all knowledge or cognizance by him that any such house was kept on his Farm. The House said to be so used was over a quarter of a mile distant from his residence, and the evidence of the <unclear/>, necessary to his conviction altogether circumstancial. The house was rented to tenants, and the disorder if any, was by those over whom he had no control whatever. He respectfully prays you to remit the fine, esteeming that its infliction is urgent.</p>
<p>The undersigned Citizens of Mason County concur in the prayer of the above petion.
