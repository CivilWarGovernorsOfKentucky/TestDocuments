   <p>To His Excellency the Govenor of Kentucky -- </p>
<p>The undersigned would respectfully state that at this term of the Kenton Circuit Court Frank Peak a young man about eighteen or nineteen years of age was convicted of Larceny and sentenced to the Penitentiary for one year. This is the first offence ever commited by this young man, and probably it was caused by outside and other pressure, and much feeling is manifested for him by all who knew him, and more especially for his mother who is a widow, and depends greatly on him for a subsistence. We would most earnestly beg your favor in his behalf, and trust on his, his mother, his sister' and his friends account you will grant him a pardon</p>

<p>I will say that, as I am advised I think it would be a becoming act of clemency <unclear/> the Governor to pardon this man</p>
