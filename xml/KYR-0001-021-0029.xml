<lb/>Hon B Magoffin
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky
<lb/>Frankfort Ky.
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>A murder was committed in this county on monday evening about four miles south of Henderson,</p>
<p>My object in writing, is to suggest or rather request that you may immediately offer a reward for the apprehension of the murderer: -- </p>
<p>The neighbors and citizens of Henderson City have offered a joint reward, by subscription, of some four or five hundred dollars, for his apprehension -- <pb/>
<lb/>There have been some fifteen or twenty young men engaged, night and hunting him, since within a few hours after the murder was committed, but up to the present time with no success.</p>
<p>It is the universal opinion, that if taken, he will be immediately punished, without a moments hearing hearing, Indeed those in search of him are armed with double barrel shotguns and will in all probability shoot him down upon sight -- </p>
<p>I am ignorant of what is necessary for me to do to justify you in offering the <hi rend="str">a</hi> reward -- I do not write this at my own instance but of that of many old citizens -- Perhaps it is the duty of the sheriff -- coronor or some other civil officer to give you formal or official ^notice^ -- I know not.<pb/>
<lb/>But hope that this may be sufficient to induce you to offer a liberal reward.</p>
<p>On monday evening <date when="1861-04-01">April the first</date> Doctor Walter Norwood, a practicing Phisician of this county, had ordered a servant to bring his horse from the stable, (a few steps distant from the house) and when about to mount being told by the boy that there was a man in the stable loft that had been interfering with him, went himself into the stable, <hi rend="str">a</hi> Upon seeing the man there he asked his name business &amp;c to which the Negro replied, that he had run away some days before from his mistress (a M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> Pentecost of this county) Doctor N. ordered him to come down and follow him to which, the negro replied by sundry threats declining however to come down the doctor then ordered the servant<pb/>
<lb/>who was holding his horse to bring him his gun, and as he turned back after having ordered his gun, the ^negro^ sprang towards him, at the same time shot him through the left breast, with a large duelling pistol, Dr N. fell dead in his tracks, M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi> Norwood who had started from the door at the report of the pistol, was threatened with another and made her escape, by fastening the door, the negro after leisurely viewing the dead body of the murdered man, made for the woods -- There being in that section of the county thousands of acres of unenclosed woodland -- covered with swamps -- ponds -- and cane, he is still at ^large^ On accompanying page I give description of Negro -- </p>
<p>Truly yr friend &amp;c
<lb/>Alex H. Major</p>
