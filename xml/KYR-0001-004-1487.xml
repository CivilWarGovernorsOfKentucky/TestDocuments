   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> E Bramlette
<lb/>Gov state of Ky.</p>
<p>Your petitioner C. H. B. Duncan would respectfully represent, that under an indictment of the Grand Jury of Franklin County Ky. he was fined the sum of fifty dollars at the fall term <date when="1864">^1864^</date> of the Circuit Court of said County &amp; state for selling intoxicating liquor to a minor. Now, your petitioner had a small lot of whiskey which he had taken up in trade &amp; to dispose of it he obtained license from the city counsel of Frankfort to retail it. And in a short time afterwards he entered the service of the United States leaving his brother in law to wind up his business &amp; to sell off the remainder of the whiskey. And that from what he can learn his brotherinlaw sold (and as he believes ignorantly sold) some of said whiskey to a young man said to be a minor. Your petitioner would further represent that he never made a business trading in such trafic &amp; that he was careful to avoid violating any law while disposing of the small<pb/>
<lb/>he had on hand. That he never knew that he was either indicted or fined until recently. That no summons or notice for trial was ever served upon him, &amp; that when judgment was rendered he was still in the service aforesaid. That he does not drink any intoxicating liquor himself &amp; if he had been at home he never would have allowed the law to have been violated at his house. That he is very limited in his means &amp; has a large family to support. &amp; cannot pay said fine without much depriving his family of the necessities of life. &amp; he respectfully throws himself upon the mercy of your-Excellency &amp; asks that the fine be remitted.</p>
