That the said N B Ford caught the said negro with a hog of his." and asked the negro what he was going to do with his pig." and the negro said that it was his. I told him it was not his, but that it was Ford's hog. then the negro said it was ^Mr^ Chambers hog, and that Mr Chambers had told him it was his to catch it &amp; carry it home, Ford then went to Chambers &amp; asked him if he told the negro to catch the pig &amp; Chambers ^said^ no he did not." &amp; Ford went to correct the negro &amp; the negro said a few cross words &amp; broke to run, then it was Ford shot him." said negro has got entirely well and if <hi rend="str">ensist</hi> ^the^ negro has a bad character as a grand rascal &amp;<hi rend="sup">c</hi><pb/>
<lb/>and if consistent with your views &amp; opinions would request you to release him said Ford of the Indictment &amp;c."</p>
