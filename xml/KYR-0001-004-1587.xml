<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Thos E. Bramlette
<lb/>Gov of Kentucky
<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I enclose an Affidavit and Petition asking for the remission of a Judgment on a Forfeited Recognizance in the case of the Com<hi rend="sup">th</hi> vs W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> S Wills &amp; Robt Hedger -- a case which under the circumstances certainly seems a proper one for your Interference. The case is briefly as follows to wit. Some two or three years ago Geo Hedger was indicted in the Montgomery circuit Court for Murder. W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> S. Wills (Brother in Law) and Robt Hedger (Father) came in at the first Court and became his Bail in the sum of $500. for his Appearance at the next Term. He appeared at the next Term and it was announced that the Bail would stand over till the next Term. This was done without Mr Wills being present &amp; without his consent: and we made this defence before the Judge, a Jury being dispensed with by consent. We so far proved it that the Judge <hi rend="str">held</hi> held it under advisement for four days<pb/>
<lb/>but your Excellency knows the difficulty of <hi rend="underline">going</hi> <hi rend="underline">behind</hi> a <hi rend="underline">Record</hi>, and it was finally decided agst. us. Mr Robert Hedger -- the Co Bail -- is totally insolvent. Mr Wills is a poor man; but an honest one -- and if he has this to pay it will in connection with his losses from rebel Guerillas, break him up. He lived in this County until about a year ago; but being robbed and threatened he moved into the lower part of Bath County -- Since going there he has been robbed some two or three times -- His house plundered &amp;c.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances he asks Your Excellency to do what you can for him. The style of the case is "Com<hi rend="sup">th</hi> vs W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> S Wills &amp; Robt Hedger on Forfeited Recog<hi rend="sup">e</hi> of Geo Hedger". ^in Montgomery Ct Court^ As a Judgment has been rendered that of course disposes of the District Attys portion &amp;. the costs and Mr Wills asks you to remit the rest. If I learn and as soon as I learn that his petition has been granted I will send the fee to the Secty. of State for making out the remission, as I believe one is allowed him </p>
<p>If Your Excellency should grant it I would be glad to hear from it as soon as convenient.</p>
<p>I am
<lb/>Your Obdt Servt
<lb/>W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Henry Holt</p>
