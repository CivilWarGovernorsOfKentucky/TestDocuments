<lb/>Dr. J D Landram &amp; E W Smith Esq.
<lb/>Gents</p>
<p>There were two Judgments rendered by the Graves Circuit at the <date when="1863-05">May term 1863</date> against me for <hi rend="str">for</hi> $60.<hi rend="underline">00</hi> each for the offence of keeping a tippling house. They are both repleved and the bonds are now due, and the fines interest and cost will amount to Sum $150.00 $160.<hi rend="underline">00</hi>. And under the circumstances it will work a great kindness on me to have to pay the State that amount. I therefor write to ask of you the favor to see the Governor and try and induce him to remit the fines. I hope you will attend to the matters for me without delay for if Something is not done to release me I will have the money to pay and thereby suffer very Seriously as my family need all the means I am able to command for there daily support</p>
<p>Your truly</p>
