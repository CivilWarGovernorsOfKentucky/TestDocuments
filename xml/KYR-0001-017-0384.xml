   <p>Louisville, Ky
<lb/><date when="1862-03-13">March 13.<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1862.</date>
<lb/>Jas W. Tate Esq<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<lb/>My dear Sir:</p>
<p>Inclosed I send you $1. -- Will you do me the favor to request the Governor to appoint me a Notary Public</p>
<p>As I have never been honored with an introduction to his Excellency or yourself, it may be proper that, in making this request, I should give some reference.</p>
<p>I am well acquainted with Jas Speed Esq<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Nath<hi rend="sup">l</hi> Wolfe Esq<hi rend="sup">r</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Joshua Tevis -- in fact all of our Legislators from this City.</p>
<p>I simply desire to be a notary as a matter of convenience to Enable ^me^ to administer Oaths to my clients in such law business as I may have to transact.<pb/></p>
<p>Permit me also to ask of you another favor -- to have the Enclosed petition delivered to the Governor.</p>
<p>Should he grant the remission, I would be glad to have it mailed to my address.</p>
<p>I defended Murphy &amp; think that under the law which allows the Carrying of concealed weapons in certain cases, he ought not to have been fined, and as he ^has^ already paid the costs &amp; that part of the fine which goes to the City Atto, he is not doing amiss to ask Executive Clemency.</p>
<p>Yrs very truly
<lb/>Rob't J. Elliott</p>
