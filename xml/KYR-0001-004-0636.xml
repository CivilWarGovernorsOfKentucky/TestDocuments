   <p>To His Excellency
<lb/>The Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>Your petitioner, T. J. O'Neal, respectfully states that on the <date when="1864-01-28">28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> January, 1864</date>, an indictment for gaming was returned against him in the City Court of Louisville, and on the <date when="1864-03-08">8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of March, 1864</date>, a verdict thereon was returned imposing a fine of $500.<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">00</hi></hi> upon which judgment was rendered. Your petitioner confesses that he has erred, and admits that he was guilty; but he states that he had been unfortunately, let into the commission of the offense, and his condition is such that it is impossible for him to satisfy the fine. Your petitioner states that he is and has been a resident of Louisville, Ky, for upwards of thirty years last past, and that he has a wife and children dependant on him for support.</p>
<p>In tender consideration of the premises he humbly, yet Earnestly prays your Excellency to remit so much of the fine against him as is coming to the Commonwealth, and, as in duty bound, he ever will &amp;c.</p>

<p>Louisville Ky
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>The petitioner T. J. O'Neal is a man of family and of limited means and has a family dependent on him for support although not intimately acquainted<pb/></p>
<p>with him yet I know he is and has been a resident of Louisville Ky for many years. This is his first offence and in view of that fact, his condition in life and his honestly in confessing the truth of the charge without imposing the burthen of proof on the commonwealth I take pleasure in recommending him to Executive Clemency and unit with him in his prayer for a remission of one half of the fine. So far as relates to my part of the fine. I have for the Same reasons declined to press its collection and have left it optional with him to pay it or not as he may think proper if he Should ever become able to do so</p>

<p>The statements made above by Mr. Reasor I believe is True &amp; in view of all the facts I believe Execution Clemency to the Extents of one half of the Fine by a remission would be proper. I unit with him in asking a remission to that Extent</p>
