  <body>
   <p>To his Excellency Beriah Magoffin,
<lb/>Governor of the State of Kentucky. </p>
<p>The petition of Valentine Sneider, humbly represents that he was at the last January Term of the City Court of Louisville convicted of an assault on Thomas Herdt and his fine assessed at Forty five dollars He further states that he is an old citizen of Louisville and has always with the above exception maintained a good character for peace and quietness. He has paid the costs of the above indictment and humbly asks that the above fine may be remitted and he will ever pray &amp;c. </p>
<p>Valentine Sneider</p>
<p>The proof in this case was abundant &amp; conflicting. Some material facts connected with the case for deft have not been noted Mr Sneider is a poor man of large family Considering all the circumstances <hi rend="str">of the case</hi> I think, <hi rend="str">justice</hi> &amp; charity would be well bestowed if the fine were remitted</p>
