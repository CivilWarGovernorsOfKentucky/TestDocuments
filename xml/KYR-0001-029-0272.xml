<lb/>To His Excellency Jas F Robinson
<lb/>Governor of the Commonwealth of Ky</p>
<p>Der Sir Enclosed I Send you a Petition Praying youre Excellency to Remit a fine against Berry Barnet for $20.00 for unlawful gaming</p>
<p>I am acquainted with Mr Barnet and know him to be a Poore but Honest man and one that is not in the habit of gambling by no Means,, I was Present and heard the trial and Evidince addressed in the Case and I was Convinced that it was nothing moore than a game for Past time and amusement with only a five Cent bet on the game and I think the ammount that he will have to pay in the way of fees &amp; Cost will be moore than Punishment Enough for the Small offence but I do not wish to dictate for you but Hope you will Consider the Case and Remit Said fine as it will be very oppressive on him and his Family if he has to pay</p>
<p>Yours with Respect
<lb/>J N B Hardwick</p>
