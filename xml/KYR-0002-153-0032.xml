<lb/>Circular.</p>
<p>It is the purpose of the Governor to stop recruiting forces for State defence under the call for 20,000 so soon as the number raised reaches 10,000 -- that number, in connection with the organization of the entire Militia, being deemed amply sufficient for any emergency. But a short time will elapse before this number will be raised. For troops under this call, no bounty is offered, save the inestimable privilege of defending their own homes.</p>
<p>The reamining 10,000 under this call will be given up for the general service in the field wherever the Military authorities of the Federal Government may wish to employ them. They will be raised either by volunteering or conscriptions. Those who volunteer in any old Regiment will receive a bounty of $300; those who volunteer in a new three years Regiment will receive a bounty of $100. those who wait to be conscripted will receive no bounty.</p>
<p>The entire Enrolled Militia of the State will be organized into Companies, battalions, regiments, brigades and divisions, and officered so as to be in a condition at any time to be called out by the Governor, and at least one Company of each regimental district will be drafted for active Militia, unless such Companies are formed by voluntary association within the time fixed by General Orders N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 3 from these Head Quarters.</p>
<p>With a view to facilitate the organization of the entire Militia force of Kentucky, a Colonel and Lieutenant Colonel will be commissioned in each County to superintend the regimental organizations.</p>
<p>By order of the Governor
