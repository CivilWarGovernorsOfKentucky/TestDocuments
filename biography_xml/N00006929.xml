        <p>Born in Lexington, Kentucky on September 13, 1831. Graduated from Transylvania University in 1849. Admitted to the Kentucky Bar in 1852. That same year, Cleary moved to Cynthiana, Harrison County, Kentucky to establish his practice. He served in the State legislature from 1859 - 1861. He was a pro-Secessionist. After Kentucky sided with the Union, Cleary joined the Confederate Army. He was soon called to Richmond where he was given a diplomatic assignment in Bermuda and Canada. He served in this capacity for the remainder of the war. Died in Covington, Kentucky on March 16, 1897.</p>
