        <p>Louisville church founded in 1839. The second African American church founded in Kentucky. Associated with the First Baptist Church, which was composed of white parishioners, until 1839. Under Pastor Henry Adams&#39;s leadership, many members of the congregation severed ties with the First Baptist Church to reorganize as First Colored Baptist Church (or First African Baptist Church) between 1839 and 1842. The congregation moved in 1848 and became known as Fifth Street Baptist Church from the new location.</p>
