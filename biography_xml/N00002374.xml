        <p>Native of Kentucky. Worked as a farm laborer in Franklin County. Enrolled as a private in Company F of the Eighteenth Kentucky Volunteer Infantry on July 7, 1862. Listed as deserted on November 12, 1862 from Paris, Kentucky. In May of 1864, Cohorn is listed as having deserted again after a sick absence in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In February of 1865, he is reported back “awaiting court martial.” In 1883, he attempted to have the charge of desertion dropped from his record. He testified that during his absences he had been given leave by his commanding officer. The Congressional Committee on Military Affairs reported on the case and denied changing the record on desertion in 1893-1894 session.</p>
