        <p>This department existed in two separate periods. This department was created on November 9, 1861. It was geographically defined by the state of Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Arkansas, and the part of Kentucky west of the Cumberland River. This department was disbanded on March 11, 1862 and combined with the Department of the Mississippi. Commander(s): Henry W. Halleck. The second was created on September 19, 1862. It was geographically defined as the states of Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas and the bordering Indian Territory, and Alton, Illinois. The Colorado and Nebraska territories were added on October 11, 1862. On January 22, 1863, part of eastern Arkansas controlled by Federal forces was removed from this department. On January 1, 1864, the state of Kansas, the territories of Nebraska and Colorado, the Indian Territory, and Fort Smith, Arkansas were transferred to the Department of Kansas. Arkansas was removed from this department to the Department of Arkansas on January 6, 1864. On January 12, 1864, Alton, Illinois was transferred to the Northern Department and then transferred back on February 15, 1864. On May 27, 1864, the department became part of the Military Division of West Mississippi.
