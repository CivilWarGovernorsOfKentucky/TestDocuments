        <p>Born on Aprip 10, 1806 in Raleigh, North Carolina. Polk attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1827. While in the Academy, he decided he wanted to peruse a career in the ministry. He became a missionary bishop of the Southwest in the Episcopal Church in 1838. In 1841 he became the bishop of Louisiana. While practicing as a bishop, Polk owned and operated several plantations in Tennessee. At the onset of the Civil War, Polk sided with the Confederacy and was commissioned Major General on June 25, 1861. Polk had a close relationship with Confederate President Jefferson Davis. He was nicknamed the &quot;Fighting Bishop&quot; Polk ordered troops to occupy Columbus, Kentucky in September 1861. He led Confederate soldiers in many battles throughout the war including the Battle of Shiloh, the Battle of Stone River, and the battle of the Battle of Chickamauga among others. Polk did not get along with his superior officer, Braxton Bragg, and did not follow Bragg&#39;s orders several times in the Perryville campaign and the Battle of Chickamagua. The conflicts between the two generals led President Davis to move Polk to Mississippi in December if 1863. Polk died on June 14, 1864 after being hit by a Union artillery shell during the Atlanta Campaign. </p>
