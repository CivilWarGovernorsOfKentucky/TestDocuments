        <p>This department was created on July 3, 1861. It was geographically defined by the state of Illinois and the states and territories west of the Mississippi River and east of the Rocky Mountains. On September 19, 1861, Union forces directing operations in the vicinity of the Ohio, Cumberland, and Ohio River junctures and at the intersection of Ohio and Mississippi Rivers became part of the Western Department. The department was disbanded on November 9, 1861. <em>Commander(s)</em>: John C. Fremont; David Hunter.</p>
