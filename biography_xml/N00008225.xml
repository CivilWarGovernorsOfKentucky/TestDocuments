        <p>Attended Norwich Academy from 1837 to 1839. Enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1840, as a midshipman, thus beginning his military career. Served on the fleet which supported the landings of Winfield Scott at Vera Cruz in 1847, during the Mexican-American War. Reached the grade of lieutenant by 1855. Abraham Lincoln sent Nelson to Kentucky, to begin recruiting troops loyal to the Union there, at the outbreak of the Civil War. Created Camp Dick Robinson in Garrard County, where troops loyal to the Union began arriving. Made brigadier general of volunteers on September 16, 1861. Saw his first major combat during the Battle of Shiloh, where he lead the 4th Division within the Army of the Ohio under Union General Don Carlos Buell. Promoted to major general on July 19, 1862. He thus became the only naval officer, from either the Union or Confederate navies, to become a full-rank major general of infantry during the Civil War. Soon after his promotion, Nelson was given command of the Army of Kentucky, consisting of only two bridges. Defeated at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky on August 30, 1862 by General Edmund Kirby Smith. Nelson was slightly wounded during that book. While recovering, one of his fellow officers, Brigadier General Jefferson C. Davis, shot and killed him in the Galt House in Louisville, Kentucky, over an insult. </p>
