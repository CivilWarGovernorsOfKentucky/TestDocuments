Chosen to represent the Southern Democratic Party as an elector for John C. Breckenridge in the 1860 election. Jacob fought to keep Kentucky from seceding from the Union as a member of the Kentucky legislature and achieved reelection in 1861. In 1862, Jacobs raised 1200 men for the Ninth Kentucky Cavalry, serving under General Don Carlos Buell. At an encounter with Confederates at Lawrenceburg, he received two gun shot wounds. Jacob fought John Hunt Morgan’s raiders in Russell County successfully and joined in the pursuit of Morgan’s troops. In 1863, he was elected Lieutenant Governor in Kentucky. However, in 1864 Jacob supported Democratic candidate General McClellan and found himself arrested and sent behind Confederate lines to Catlettsburg.  After successfully petitioning President Lincoln, Jacob was released. Post-War he stood unsuccessfully for election to Congress, but filled a term as judge of Oldham County</p>
