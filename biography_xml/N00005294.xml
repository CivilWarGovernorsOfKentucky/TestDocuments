        <p>Born in Virginia, Brownlow entered the Methodist ministry and moved to Tennessee, where he started a newspaper.  He married Eliza An O’Brien on August 5, 1836.  An unsuccessful campaign for Congress in 1842 and later political appointment by President Millard Fillmore (as member of the Tennessee River Commission for the Improvement of Navigation) and election as delegate to Tennessee’s constitutional convention in 1864 helped make Brownlow a well known political figure in the state.  He was elected governor as a Republican in 1865.</p>
