        <p>A nationally-known jurist. Born in Scott County, Kentucky, near Georgetown, son of John Alvin Duvall, who migrated to Kentucky from Maryland, was an officer in the War of 1812. Alvin Duvall graduated with distinction from Georgetown College in 1833. Then studied law under Governor James F. Robinson at Georgetown, completing his legal course at Transylvania University, near Lexington, Kentucky, in March 1840. Elected to the Kentucky legislature in 1850. Appointed circuit judge in 1852. Term expired in 1854. He was then elected judge of the court of appeals, an office he held until 1864. Arrested and imprisoned by the military governor in 1864, on the ground that he was a Confederate sympathizer. Duvall fled to Canada to avoid this decree, returning to Georgetown two months later. Married Virginia Holtzclaw. Father of Henry Duvall, Alvin Duvall, Willie Duvall Sneed, Mary Stites Duvall, and Hallie Rodman Duvall.</p>
